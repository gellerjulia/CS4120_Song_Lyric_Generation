one can not placate
the wake you left is vicious
i cultivate evil that 's surrounding me .
so it shall come to me ...
royalty and  ,  denied the  teat
a passionate hour ` s never crossing our mind
we wo n't be fooled just like a lady she 'll keep you safe
for he passed away
darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
and you got me rockin ' and a reelin ' barbara ann
calling calming silence
the one that you want to ?
bright eyes
loss of hope and happiness
lay to rest a soul so kind
lords – of chaos awaits
we lost the way , do we need the pain ?
till the trees are all dead
i feel the need to feed
the indescribable
bury me three feet deep
lost without your love
life must go on
corpses will burn
i 've taken my cut
did you ever see ?
something borrowed
they 'll torture her soul
to your mass control
taking the time to rise again
on their old tomb stones
my  dream ,
thoughts will overflow
live again ,
do you remember me at all
take away the darkness from your heart
hotter than fire ca n't you see the danger of armament
welcome to the otherland
it was so easy , so easy now
tires screaming
your pleasure is torture
kingdom – of pain
the executioner 's song rolls on
a twisted state of mind ?
turning cream with fantasies
the winter sun
the sun that takes our lives away
i do n't believe in tomorrow
ever dreamed of
happier than you and me
with no demands
how could you kill me
that 's how i get my kicks just when i close my eyes and sit back as i watch my end begin
i have spoken my mind from deep inside my head
you wo n't find any beasts to slay
spook city u.s.a .
in the dead end
what will be
frustration deep inside
they´re still alive
beware now the twist of fate
an unrelenting  cloud
mass  psychos with a million scars
now after all that we neglect
i must admit it sounds so strange ( strange )
mornin ' , sad mornin '
there 's nothing that you can take them all
when i feel the distant stare
as i always do
could n't save you
carry banners which denounce the lord
women in uniform , women in uniform
how it burns to the ground
it what you like to trick control
watching as the sand flows through glass
let me out
here 's my course of life
wrong time , wrong place
an  lover 's seed
above my head
i 've moved along
all beauty lies within
run for your life ( the earth 's on fire )
mother 's mirror , father 's pride
one step into wonderland
need i say
now nature 's dying , it 's a stupid fuckin ' hoax
oh , yeah oh yeah
while the sheep wait to die
to the
future 's bright and glorious
comets tear the skies as they writhed
they  last very long and theyve been pretty
bolnoi ,  , los  , and the blood will come to pay
i 'll send all my loving , i will not hurt
straight line into the galaxy
how could one eventually express
are you listening to me ?
basis all for me , and only me
wo n't let 'em leave us , do n't ever lose your faith
