only a tramp was lazarus sad fate
he who lay down at the rich man's gate
he begged for the crumbs from the rich man to eat
he was only a tramp found dead on the street
"he was some mother's darlin', he was some mother's son"
once he was fair and once he was young
"and some mother rocked him, her darlin' to sleep"
but they left him to die like a tramp on the street
"jesus, he died on calvary's tree"
he shed his life's blood for you and for me
they pierced his side and then his feet
and they left him to die like a tramp on the street
"he was mary's own darlin', he was god's chosen son"
once he was fair and once he was young
"mary, she rocked him, her darlin' to sleep"
but they left him to die like a tramp on the street
if jesus should come and knock on your door
"for a place to come in, or bread from your store"
"would you welcome him in, or turn him away"
then the god's would deny you on the great judgement day
christmas time again
"the perfect end, to a not-so-perfect year"
at last it's here
hustle bustle to and fro
"from store to store, to get one more"
of whatever is in style this year
on the marquee sign at 5 and 9
"the latest movie shows, and it starts to snow"
children look into the sky
to see if reindeer really fly
who knows
but when it comes down to this season
above it all there's still a reason
to just look up
a star is born tonight
come to make things right
"angels singing, anthems ringing"
glory to the king
a star is born tonight
"silent holy night, heaven's sacred light"
shines all around
and joy resounds
in manger hay the baby jesus came to seek
and save the lost
until they're found
peace on earth a new beginning
he's the gift that keeps on giving
to all of us
a star is born tonight
"(choir) glory hallelujah, glory to the king of kings"
come to make things right
(choir) merry christmas to you all the joy the season brings
"angels singing, anthems ringing"
glory to the king
a star is born tonight
"angels singing, anthems ringing"
glory to the king
summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times
for the times i miss you most of all are summer winter spring and fall
your love for me is over but sweet me'ries i still recall
each season brings its changes but in me there's been no change at all
summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times
i thought some day i'll forget you but the chances now seem very small
there's too much of you still here with me to ever forget you at all
summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times
for the times i miss you most of all are summer winter spring and fall
i used to cry out in the middle of the night
baby hold me tight
but there was nobody beside me
when i opened my eyes
now i've turned a corner on those days and nights
and something inside me is changing
i think i might be starting over
and i don't wanna run
"oh no 'cause you might be the one, baby"
if ever i could love
i think it could be with you
if ever i thought i'd
found somebody so true
i wonder if you feel
the same way that i do
if ever i could love
i think it could be with you
you know i can't read your mind my love
but it seems to me
that your heart and mine tonight are
defying gravity
there's something so familiar and still so unknown
but the closer that we get i swear it feels like
coming home
and i'm ready to be brave
"oh yeah then you look at me and say, baby"
if ever i could love
i think it could be with you
if ever i thought i'd
found somebody so true
i wonder if you feel
the same way that i do
if ever i could love
i think it could be with you
if ever i could love
if ever i could love
if ever i could love
if ever i could love
if ever i could love
i think it could be with you
if ever i thought i'd
find somebody so true
i wonder if you feel
the same way that i do
if ever i could love
i think it could be with you
if ever i could love
if ever i could love
if ever i could love
if ever i could love
i was scared to love again
feel the pain that came
"when she walked out of my life,"
i got hurt so bad i swore i'd never let another
get inside this heart of mine
but you touched my hand and every plan that i had
disappeared like a falling star
and there's a new beginning and i'm
movin' to the rhythm of a beating braver heart
i've been a fool i've been a fool
forgivin' you each time that you've done me wrong
i've been a long time leavin' but i'll be a long time gone
loved you so much i loved you so much
i stayed around when i should've moved along
i've been a long time leaving but i'll be a long time gone
hello highline hello highway here come a big ole semi my way

on my big legs are my levi's hup hup hup hup
i've been a fool...

hello highline hello highway...

"i was lost in the wild side of life,"
i was blinded by smoke and neon lights.
i was drinkin' and sinkin' without a prayer.
then she showed up right out of thin air.
"she took me to heaven, oh my lord, what a ride!"
"and i've never been higher, on her love i could fly."
"i was hellbound, on my way down, then i found what i need:"
"oh, an angel loved the devil out of me."
i thank god for her love each day.
he saved me when he sent her my way.
"now each night, i drive by those neon lights,"
and go home to my own paradise.
"where she takes me to heaven, oh my lord, what a ride!"
"and i've never been higher, on her love i could fly."
"i was hellbound, on my way down, then i found what i need."
"oh, an angel loved the devil out of me."
oh yes she did.
though the sun may be dawning
you're the one that lights the morning
as i awake to the heaven
of your sweet summer lovin'
by a stream in the country
running barefoot and feeling free
while the love in our hearts blend
into sweet summer lovin'
sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
when that big red balloon sets
like a painting across the west
as the sky turns a crimson blue
as the world turns for me and you
by the light of the moon glowing
while the warm summer wind blows
'cross the sill of your window
we'll be letting our love flow
sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
sweet summer lovin'
sweet summer lovin'
mmm...
sweet summer lovin'
mmm...
sweet summer lovin'
i love your sweet summer lovin'
sweet summer lovin'
sweet summer lovin'
mmm...
sweet summer lovin'
mmm...
sweet summer lovin'
they packed up all his buckles
and shipped his saddle to his dad
and by the way the house looked
she must have took it bad
the workers come on monday
to fix the door and patch the wall
they say she just went crazy
the night she got the call
he was up in wyoming
and drew a bull no man could ride
he promised her he'd turn out
well it turned out that he lied
and their dreams that they'd been livin'
in the california sand
died right there beside him in cheyenne
they she just went crazy
screamin' out his name
she ran out into the ocean
and to this day they claim
that if you go down by the water
you'll see her footprints in the sand
'cause every night she walks the beaches of cheyenne
they never found her body
just her diary by her bed
it told about the fight they had
and the words that she had said
when he told her he was ridin'
she said then i don't give a damn
if you never come back from cheyenne
they she just went crazy
screamin' out his name
she ran out into the ocean
and to this day they claim
that you can go down by the water
and see her footprints in the sand
'cause every night she walks the beaches of cheyenne
nobody can explain it
some say she's still alive
they even claim they've seen her
on the shoreline late at night
so if you go down by the water
you'll see her footprints in the sand
'cause every night she walks the beaches of cheyenne
every night she walks the beaches of cheyenne
i like you like me i use you
use me: we're both happy
i'm a bitch you're perfect for me:
"filthy, rich and handy"
i know you can't be impressed
still i can't leave you linger
all i want's to please you more
i want you round my finger
i need you round my finger
don't bother educating me
if you like your angels dumb
one way or any other dear
i'll harass you till you're numb
and if you'd like a girl like saint
i'll be your little nun
one way or any other dear
i'll harass you till you're numb:
na-na-na-numb
you want more and more from me
i want to keep you wanting
"whip me, goad, exploit, insult me"
but please look glad to have me
all i want's to please you more
all i want's to tease you more
all i want's to squeeze you more
for reason or another dear
i'll attack you 'til you're numb
jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse sleigh hey
jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
over the fields we go laughing all the way(ha ha ha)
bells on bobtail ring making sprits bright
what fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh hey!
jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
you know i hate the cold
that's why i always go
down south to drink some rum
on a island in the sun
there’s nothing like st. barts
with the palm trees swaying slow
or being there on jost van dyke
when the new year comes and goes
oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh hey
jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
i could say it's over now
that i was glad to see you go
i could hate you for the way i'm feelin'
my lips could tell a lie but my heart would know
it's a sin to make me cry
when you know i love you so
i could tell my heart that i don't miss you
my lips could tell a lie but my heart would know
i could give you all the blame
but i'm sure the truth would show
i could tell this world i've found a new love
my lips could tell a lie but my heart would know
i can't fool my cryin' heart
'cause it knows i need you so
i could tell my heart i'm glad we parted
my lips could tell a lie but my heart would know
will i need a miss of my life
"each time i went left, i should've gone right"
and love's no exception to this rule
cause i turned around i lost you
now i'm feeling lonesome and blue
just the way i expect to
but there's something that i could use
to help me deal with this abuse
if french fries were fat free
and you still love me
if french fries were fat free
and you still love me
what a wonderful world this would be
if the whiskey really helped me
forget your memory
i'd wear a smile endlessly
if french fries were fat free
and you still love me
you know the more i think about you
the more sense it makes
cause grease and love both cause heartache
so i raise my glass and toast
these things i want the most
though i probably never see
i can't help but believing
that if french fries were fat free
and you still love me
what a wonderful world this would be
if the whiskey really helped me
forget your memory
i'd wear a smile endlessly
if french fries were fat free
and you still love me
oh if french fries were fat free
and you still love me
keep it coming
i've got your back
do not fear
when i'm on deck
a bigger lie i've never told
a bigger story yet to unfold
my only guarantee: i will fuck you up
another day
of pure energy
what wears most
is the constancy
a bigger job i've never had
a bigger burden i could not drag
my only guarantee: i will fuck you up
strange how things
come about
will i ever know
how things turn out
a bigger wish i've never known
a bigger question i'm trying to hone
my only guarantee: i will fuck you up
[ with jessi colter ]
when you're weary feeling small when tears are in your eyes i'll dry them all

sail on silver girl sail on by your time has come to shine
all the dreams are on their way
see how they shine if you need a friend i'm sailing out behind
she understands me and she cares how i feel
cause she's always there to hold my hand
somehow she knows it when this old world's got me down
yes she understands her man
we've seen the rain and the sunshine together
many times she's watched me stumble and fall
and she's always there by my side when i need her
through the good through the bad through it all
and though how it hurts me when her dreams don't come true
when i can't give her all the things i planned
but lord it ain't easy and she knows that's light
thank god for my woman she understands
sunny days seem to hurt the most
i wear the pain like a heavy coat
i feel you everywhere i go
i see your smile
i see your face
i hear you laughing in the rain
i still can't believe you're gone
it ain't fair
you died too young
like a story that had just begun
but death tore the pages all away
god knows how i miss you
all the hell that i've been through
just knowing no one could take your place
sometimes i wonder
who you'd be today
would you see the world
would you chase your dreams
settle down with a family
i wonder what would you name your babies
somedays the sky's so blue
i feel like i can talk to you
i know it might sound crazy
it ain't fair
you died too young
like a story that had just begun
but death tore the pages all away
god knows how i miss you
all the hell that i've been through
just knowing no one could take your place
sometimes i wonder
who you'd be today
"today, today, todayyyyy"
"today, today, todayyyyy"
sunny days seem to hurt the most
i wear the pain like a heavy coat
the only thing that gives me hope
"is i know, i'll see you again someday"
"someday, somedayyyy"
"i was born the running kind, leaving always on my mind"
home was never home to me at anytime
every front door found me open i would find the back door open
there just had to be a lesson for the running kind
"within me there's a prison, surrounding me alone"
as real as any dungeon with a wall of stone
"i know running's not the answer, but running's been my nature"
and a part of me that keeps me moving on
"i was born the running kind, leaving always on my mind"
home was never home to me at anytime
every front door found me open i would find the back door open
there just had to be a lesson for the running kind

i thought i'd give my love to anyone today
but when it came to you one thing was for sure
well i know your little games and i don't wanna play
it's like takin' sick when nobody knows the cure
you come on like the princess of the junior prom
always part of everything that's going down
just looking for another fool to lean upon
in the center ring and everyone's your clown
can't you see i've lost my nerve
i just can't face you
perhaps i'll let the time erase you
can't you see i've lost my nerve
i just can't face you
perhaps i'll let the time erase you
i thought i'd give my love to anyone today
but when it came to you one thing was for sure
well i know your little games and i don't wanna play
it's like takin' sick when nobody knows the cure

i was [waltzing]* with my darlin' to the tennessee waltz
when an old friend i happened to see
i introduced [her to my loved one]** and while they were dancin'
my friend stole my sweetheart from me

only you know just how much i have lost
yes i lost my little darlin' the night they were playin'
that beautiful tennessee waltz

if my heart was just the destination
she had herself one hell of a vacation
if my kiss was just the main attraction
she wore it out like it was going out of fashion
if my touch was just some kind of ride
then she loved that roller-coaster
i guess she came down from that high
"when it was over, it was over"
she did what she came to do
saw what she came to see
took a good look around
made her some memories
never been there before
she crossed it off the map
pedal down to the floor
now she ain't coming back
that's the last i'll see of her
she's been there
got the t-shirt
i wonder if she'll just throw it in the closet
or keep it out and tell her friends
just how she got it
"i wonder if she's sleeping in it,"
dreaming in it
"i wonder if she knows what she did to me, yeah"
she did what she came to do
saw what she came to see
took a good look around
made her some memories
never been there before
she crossed it off the map
pedal down to the floor
now she ain't coming back
that's the last i'll see of her
she's been there
got the t-shirt
with stones on the front
tour dates on the back
took it when she left
took a lot more than that
she did what she came to do
saw what she came to see
took a good look around
made her some memories
never been there before
she crossed it off the map
pedal down to the floor
now she ain't coming back
that's the last i'll see of her
she's been there
got the t-shirt
"great is thy faithfulness, o god my father"
there is no shadow of turning with thee
"thou changest not, thy compassions, they fail not"
"as thou hast been, thou forever will be"
great is thy faithfulness
great is thy faithfulness
morning by morning new mercies i see
all i have needed thy hand hath provided
"great is thy faithfulness, lord, unto me"
summer and winter and springtime and harvest

"to thy great faithfulness, mercy and love"
great is thy faithfulness
great is thy faithfulness
morning by morning new mercies i see
all i have needed thy hand hath provided
"great is thy faithfulness, lord, unto me"
pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide
strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow

great is thy faithfulness
great is thy faithfulness
morning by morning new mercies i see
all i have needed thy hand hath provided
great is thy faithfulness
great is thy faithfulness
great is thy faithfulness
"lord, unto me"
"hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm"
if i should stay
i would only be in your way
"so i'll go, but i know"
i'll think of you each step of the way
and i will always love you
i will always love you
bitter sweet memories
that is all i am taking with me

bonnie was a waitress in a small cafe
clyde barrow was the rounder that took her away
they both robbed and killed until both of them died
so goes the legend of bonnie and clyde.
the poems that she wrote of the life that they led
told of the lawmen left dying or dead
some say that clyde made her life a shame
but the legend made bonnie the head of the game.
the rampage grew wilder with each passing day
the odds growing smaller with each get-a-way
with the end growing closer the harder they fought
with blood on their hands they were bound to get caught.
they drove back from town on one bright summer day
when a man they befriended stepped out in the way
with no thought of dyin' they pulled to the side
but death lay there waiting for bonnie and clyde.
two years or runnin' was ended that day
for robbin' and killin' they both had to pay
but we'll always remember how they lived and died
so goes the legend of bonnie and clyde.
i set out on a narrow way
many years ago
hoping i would find true love
along the broken road
but i got lost a time or two
wiped my brow and kept pushing through
couldn't see how every sign
pointed straight to you
every long lost dream
led me to where you are
others who broke my heart
they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way
into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to
led me straight to you
others who broke my heart
they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way
into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to you
(yes it did)
i think about the years i spent
just passing through
i'd like to have the time i lost
and give it back to you
but you just smiled and take my hand
you've been there you understand
it's all part of a grander plan
that is coming true
every long lost dream
led me to where you are
others who broke my heart
they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way
into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me strait to
led me straight to you
others who broke my heart
they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way
into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to you
(yeah)
now i'm just rolling home
into my lover's arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that lead me straight to you
that god blessed the broken road
that lead me straight to you
(oooh)
halos and horns
writer dolly parton
"halos and horns, sinners and saints,"
hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
just because it feels right does not make it so
so we struggle through life in horns and halos
tempted and tried with each step we take
"we stumble and slide and make our mistakes,"
"ask god to forgive us for all of our sins,"
then we take off our horns and wear halos again
"halos and horns, sinners and saints,"
hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
just because it feels right does not make it so
so we struggle through life in horns and halos
"halos and horns, sinners and saints,"
"we're praised or we're scorned, we either run or we faint"
"oh, but life is a challenge from the day that we're born"
just tryin' to balance halos and horns
"it's heaven or hell, halos or horns"
"halos and horns, sinners and saints,"
hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
"but just because it feels right; well, that don't make it so"
so we struggle through life in horns or halos
it's either horns or halos
(leslie winn satcher)
there's a key in a letter unopened
buried back in an old dresser drawer
there's a name stained with tears on that letter
one that i'm sure i've never seen before
there's no date on that letter unopened
my guess is it's faded with years
and i can't sleep at night now for wonderin'
how long has that secret been hiding here
"did you love someone, lose someone"
leave someone waiting
is there somebody's heart out there
you could have taken
the letter says it all
though the words go unspoken
you loved me enough to leave it unopened
there's a love that is trust without reason
there's a faith that leaves questions unasked
and though my heart has searched for the answer
i love you too much for these lips to ask
"did you love someone, lose someone"
leave someone waiting
is there somebody's heart out there
you could have taken
the letter says it all
though the words go unspoken
you loved me enough to leave it unopened
"oh, the letter says it all"
though the words go unspoken
i love hearing that shower turn on
bet there's nothin' but a towel on you
you sing along with some timberlake bumpin'
but he ain't got nothin' on you
i don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
"a goodbye kiss, then lockin' the door yeah"
"sounds like leavin' you, oh"
it's a little too loud on the highway
i wanna pull back in your driveway
it's way too quiet at my place
"wanna come on over, come on over"
i just wanna hear that ringtone
i like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone
wanna hear you say come on over
'cause when you tell me to come on over
i like the sound of that
mm mm mm
"i like the sound, i like the sound of that"
mm mm mm
"i like the sound, i like the sound of that"
love the sound of the thunder rollin'
makes you move a little closer to me
girl i bet that your neighbors hate us
'cause we could laugh all night and never sleep
we can worry 'bout the world in the mornin'
"light up a candle, lock the door"
"wanna stay right here with you, yes i do"
it's a little too loud on the highway
i wanna pull back in your driveway
it's way too quiet at my place
"wanna come on over, come on over"
i just wanna hear that ringtone
i like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone
wanna hear you say come on over
'cause when you tell me to come on over
i like the sound of that
mm mm mm
"i like the sound, i like the sound of that"
mm mm mm
"i like the sound, i like the sound of that"
"turn your radio on, baby turn down the lights"
"i'm ain't goin' nowhere, i'm all yours tonight"
it's a little too loud on the highway
i wanna pull back in your driveway
it's way too quiet at my place
"wanna come on over, come on over"
i just wanna hear that ringtone
i like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone
wanna hear you say come on over
'cause when you tell me to come on over
i like the sound of that

oh
you got you some legs baby
that just won't quit
you got a pretty boy
and he looks pretty hip
you got you one on the sly
but you gave him the slip
and that's just a cryin' shame
'cause you love the boy
with pretty green eyes
and you love the boy
who says he's so clever and wise
and you love the boy
who's always telling you lies
and that's just a cryin' shame
sometimes it never quits raining
sometimes that phone just won't ring
sometimes i never miss nothing
and sometimes i miss anything
but you like 'em tall when it's raining
and you like 'em dark when you're feeling no pride
but you never felt anything that you wanted to hide
and that's just a cryin' shame
so he says you look lovely my dear
you say thank you i'm fine
and you spend all his money
and you spend all his time
and you spend the night
like you were spending a dime
and that's just a cryin' shame
whats this
your kiss
it's as cold as a falling snow
and your eyes cannot disguise
theres a secret in your soul
did you think that i was born yesterday
well i may be blind
but i can hear what you wanna say
i feel it comin'
i feel it comin' on
i feel it comin' on
this love is dead and gone
and i know it wont be long
cause i feel it comin' on
a cold spell
in hell
thats when i take you back
if you haven't been untrue
there's nothin' left to do but pack your bags
and sleep in the bed that you made
when you'll wake up cryin'
callin out my name
my pain
i feel it comin'
i feel it comin' on
i feel it comin' on
this love is dead and gone
and i know it wont be long
cause i feel it comin on
comin on like a mornin sun
like a summer rain
like a river run
like the ocean waves
like the stormy sea
like a flood of tears wash over me
and i feel it comin'
i feel it comin' on
i feel it comin' on
this love is dead and gone
and i know it won't be long
cause i feel it comin' on
yes i feel it comin' on
lord i feel it come
"the sign said ""40 miles to canada"""
my truck tore across montana
ian tyson singing 'lonesome lullaby'
and so i cranked up the radio
'cause there's just a little more to go
before i cross the border at that sweet grass sign
i'm alberta bound
this peace of heaven that i've found
rocky mountains and black fertal ground
"everything i need, beneath that big blue sky"
it doesn't matter where i go
this place will always be my home
i have been alberta bound for all my life
and i'll be alberta bound until i die
it's a pride that's been passed down to me
deep as coal mines
wide as farmer's fields
"yeah, i've got independence in my veins"
maybe it's my down home redneck roots
or these dusty old alberta boots
but like the chinook wind keeps coming back again
i'm alberta bound
this piece of heaven that i've found
rocky mountains and black fertal ground
"everything i need, beneath that big blue sky"
it doesn't matter where i go
this place will always be my home
"yeah, i've been alberta bound for all my life"
and i'll be alberta bound until i die
"oh, it doesn't matter where i go"
this place will always be my home
i have been alberta bound for all my life
and i'll be alberta bound until i die
(paul brandt)
unaware angel falling into sleep
i never quite believed that i'd get in this deep
i don't have a doubt
we are the one
oh i love to watch you as the day begins
sun comes through the window
starts to kiss your skin
chase the shadows out
we are the one
we're the story told since time began
we're what heaven holds inside her hand
we're the one thing i never knew i needed
but you completed me and
we are the one
i want to be with you as the years go by
"i know i won't be perfect, but for you i'll try"
that's what love's about
we are the one
we're the story told since time began
we're what heaven holds inside her hand
we're the one thing i never knew i needed
but you completed me and
we are the one thing i never knew i needed
but you completed me and
i was ridin' no 9 headin' south from caroline
i heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
got in trouble had to roam i left my gal and left my home
i heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
just a kid acting smart i went and broke my darling's heart
i guess i was too young to know
they took me off that georgia main locked me to a ball and chain
i heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
[ steel ]
all alone i bear the shame i'm a number not a name
i heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
all i do is sit and cry when the evening train goes by
i heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
i'll be locked here in this cell till my body's just a shell
and my hair turns whiter than snow
i'll never see that gal of mine i'm in georgia doing time
i heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
who's in houston that's keepin' you from talkin' to me
i ain't used to layin' down without the sound of your voice
before i drift off to sleep
"girl, you got me climbin' the walls"
if you can't find the time to call
"text me, texas"
before you turn off your phone
i'm a wreck and i'm restless
gotta feelin' that you're not alone
it's breakin' my heart and i'm startin' get the message
"come on and text me, texas"
i pray what you ain't sayin' don't mean what all my friends say it means
maybe you can give me just a couple of lines i could read between
you could even tell me a lie
anything to get me by
"come on and text me, texas"
before you turn off your phone
i'ma wreck and i'm restless
gotta feelin' that you're not a lone
yeah it's breakin' my heart and i'm startin' to get the message
"comone on, text me texas"
whatever you can't tell me now
"baby, you could spell it out"
"text me, texas"
before you turn off your phone
i'm a wreck and restless
got this feelin' you're not alone
it's breakin' my heart and i'm startin' to get the message
come on and text me texas
full moon friday night after the game
stars must have all lined up early that day
"i just turned 17, she had me by a month"
"we were young, we were green to the taste, to the touch"
from that very first kiss
it was like we were born for that moment
caught up in the perfect storm
it came in like a flood over the gate
swallowed us up and it swept us away
"we were over our heads, me and that girl"
"we were out of our minds, it was out of this world"
"it was always too much, it was never enough"
it was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
it was love
we reigned like the king and the queen of the land
everyone wanted some of what we had then
"yeah, we were the ones they all talked about"
like we were the fire that would never go out
it came in like a flood over the gate
swallowed us up and it swept us away
"we were over our heads, me and that girl"
"we were out of our minds, it was out of this world"
"it was always too much, it was never enough"
it was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
it was love
"we knew it was coming, still, it came way too soon"
neither one knew what to say or to do
"so, we just let the radio play while we danced"
we laughed and we cried like i never have since
it came in like a flood over the gate
swallowed us up and it swept us away
"we were over our heads, me and that girl"
"we were out of our minds, it was out of this world"
"it was always too much, it was never enough"
it was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
it was love
it was love
it was love
it was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
she dropped the phone and burst into tears
the doctor just confirmed her fears
her husband held it in and held her tight
cancer don't discriminate
or care if you're just thirty-eight
with three kids who need you in their lives
he said i know that you're afraid and i am too
but you'll never be alone i promise you

"when you're weak, i'll be strong"
"when you let go, i'll hold on"
when you need to cry
i swear that i'll be there to dry your eyes
when you feel lost and scared to death
like you can't take one more step
"just take my hand, together we can do it"
i'm gonna love you through it
she made it throught the surgery fine
they said they caught it just in time
but they had to take more than they planned
and now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts
to hide what the cancer took from her
and she just wants to feel like a woman again
she said i don't think i can do this anymore
he took her in his arms and said
that's what my love is for
"when you're weak, i'll be strong"
"when you let go, i'll hold on"
when you need to cry
i swear that i'll be there to dry your eyes
when you feel lost and scared to death
like you can't take one more step
"just take my hand, together we can do it"
i'm gonna love you through it
oh baby
and when this road gets too long
i'll be the rock you lean on
"just take my hand, together we can do it"
i'm gonna love you through it
i'm gonna love you throught it

modern day matrimony
is a pre-some kind of deal
you need a preacher and a lawyer
a
just to tell you how you feel
now i believe in love and marriage
"i guess you need a license,too"
but all that really gives you
d
is the legal right to sue

"if a picture paints a thousand words,"
then why canâ´t i paint you?
the words will never show
the you iâ´ve come to know
"if a face could launch a thousand ships,"
then where am i to go?
"thereâ´s no one home but you,"
youâ´re all thatâ´s left me too
"and when my love for life is running dry,"
you come and pour yourself on me
"if i could be two places at one time,"
iâ´d be with you
"tomorrow and today,"
beside you all the way
if the world should stop revolving
"spinning slowly down to die,"
iâ´d spend the end with you
"and when the world was through,"
"then one by one the stars would all go out,"
then you and i would simply fly away
"if a picture paints a thousand words,"
then why canâ´t i paint you?
'cause the words could never show
the you iâ´ve come to know
"and one by one the stars will all go out,"
but you and i will simply fly away
we'll fly away

"who are you,"
the one for whom i'd really gladly suffer
"who are you,"
the one i'll always love above another
you're my world
you're my hope
you're all my dreams and all my heart
who are you
the one i give my life to
"who are you,"
who loves as deep as i do
"who are you,"
who takes me through the flood and through the fire
"who are you,"
who leads me through the desert and the dry
you're in my thoughts
you know my mind
"you're all my things, you're all my light"
who are you
the one i give my life to
"who are you,"
who loves as deep as i do
"you're my savior, you're my center"
my beginning and my end
"you're the one i live for, you're my angel"
who are you
you're in my thoughts
you know my mind
"you're all my things, you're all my light"
who are you
the one i give my life to
"who are you,"
who loves as deep as i do
who are you
who fell on me like fire
"who are you,"
who takes me through desire
"who are you,"
the one i give my life to.

don't wanta walk unless i'm walkin' with you
don't wanta talk unless i'm talkin' to you
"don't wanta be lonesome, don't wanta be blue"
"baby, that's how much i love you"
don't wanta cry unless i'm cryin' for you
don't wanta sigh unless i'm sighin' for you
don't wanta be found with somebody new
"baby, that's how much i love you"
i built my whole world around you
"darlin', don't ever break my heart"
i'm so glad that i found you
"and in my life, you'll always play a part"
don't wanta live unless i'm livin' with you
don't wanta give unless i'm givin' to you
"don't wanta be lonesome, don't wanta be blue"

there's a reason why
you can look up every night
and every star in heaven's in its place
there's a reason why
the full moon pulls up the tide
and waves roll in to a shore that always waits
and just like that
baby you belong
baby you belong
nothing's ever been so meant to be
or ever felt so right to me
every single part of me believes
baby you belong
"oh, baby you belong"
there really is no mystery
i think anyone can see
that baby you belong with me
there's a voice inside
and i heard it promise me
when you came along
i know you by heart
like a familiar song
every word is telling me
that the time has finally come
now here you are
and i know for sure
like the sun belongs up in the morning sky
e
i have battled with the demons for my soul
a
"like a soldier unafraid,stood straight and tall"
e
with strong convictions fought for what i thought was right and wrong
d a e
but i wonder when it stands in judgement hall
d a e
will it go down as one too close to call
e
i have faced that cunning ennemy called time
a
for awhile i held him cold and to a draw
e
as he rode away he said another place and day
d a e
'cause you can't erase the writing on the wall
d a e
although this one was just too close to call
e
as i wrestled with my deepest fear in life
a
i was captured by the shadows on the wall
e
"i was brave but just the same,i was glad when morning came"
d a e
because now and then the footsteps in the hall
d a e
remind me it was just too close to call
e
i have watched my mind dance too close to the edge
a
as i stood among the crowd to see it fall
e
sometimes now i cling to what i hope is sanity
d a e
i stagger on this fine like that i walk
d a e
and wonder is it just too close to call
slipping through the trees and it looks so pretty in your eyes
"i guess i got carried away, kept you out here all night"
i hope you don't mind
by the smile i see on your face
"i think you're havin' a good time, a good time"
when i picked you up
knew it wouldn't be enough
couldn't fit it in one night
shoulda told you then
soon as you got in
i'd be taking my sweet time
i could show you around
all over the town
"whatever you like, girl"
ain't a way i can love you
the way that i want to
in just one night girl
i know
that i'm just now getting to be somebody that you know
kick your seat on back cause girl we're gonna take it real slow
we already turned last night into tomorrow
and we're just getting started
when i picked you up
knew it wouldn't be enough
couldn't fit it in one night
shoulda told you then
soon as you got in
i'd be taking my sweet time
i could show you around
all over the town
"whatever you like, girl"
ain't a way i can love you
the way that i want to
in just one night girl
i'm gonna love you
i'm gonna show you
"i'm gonna do you right, girl"
you ain't a one kiss
kind that i won't miss
you ain't just a one night girl
when i picked you up
knew it wouldn't be enough
couldn't fit it in one night
shoulda told you then
soon as you got in
i'd be taking my sweet time
i could show you around
all over the town
"whatever you like, girl"
ain't a way i can love you
the way that i want to
in just one night girl
you ain't a one night girl
you ain't a one night girl
you ain't a one night girl
you ain't a one night girl
"no, no"

"we?re looking for the king,"
the new messiah
"we?re following the star,"
shining brighter
old man won?t you help us if you can
he shook his head but he point pointed his hand
there?s a new kid in town
and he?s lying in a manger down the road
there?s a new kid in town
but he?s just another baby i suppose
heaven knows
there?s a new kid in town
here in bethlehem
(kelly clarkson)
"i see you?ve traveled far,"
bearing treasures
you say these gifts are for
the new king?s pleasures
i have heard that a king might come
but up ?til now there hasn?t been one
(blake shelton & kelly clarkson) (2x)
there?s a new kid in town
and he?s lying in a manger down the road
there?s a new kid in town
but he?s just another baby i suppose
heaven knows
there?s a new kid in town
here in bethlehem
everybody's had the blues sometimes and
everybody knows the tune.
and everybody knows the way i'm feelin' cause
everybody's had the blues.
"a lonely, song someone is gone,"
a story old as time.
"love, hate, or want and wait till misery fills your mind."
but everybody knows the way i'm fellin' cause
everybody's had the blues.
we crossed the wild pecos
we forded the nueces
we swum the guadalupe
and we followed the brazos
red river runs rusty
the wichita clear
but down by the brazos
i courted my dear
"singing li, li, li, le, le, le"
lend me your hand
"li, li, li, le, le, le"
lend me your hand
"li, li, li, le, le, le"
lend me your hand
there's many a river
that waters the land
now the fair angelina
runs glossy and gliding
the crooked colorado
runs weaving and winding
the slow san antonio
courses and plains
but i never will walk
by the brazos again
she kissed me and she hugged me
and she called me her dandy
the trinity's muddy
but the brazos quick sandy
she kissed me and she hugged me
and she called me her own
but down by the brazos
she left me alone
now the girls of little river
they're plump and they're pretty
the sabine and the sulphur
hold beauties a'many
the banks of the neches
there are girls by the score
but down by the brazos
i'll wander no more
well i gotta keep my reputation i gotta keep my pride
can't let you know you've hurt me i can't let you know i've cried
i gotta make you think i'm happy everywhere i go
i gotta keep my hurt inside me i can't let it show
i gotta drink up and be somebody i have another round
i can't let my troubles find me i gotta keep your mem'ry down
can't let you drive me crazy can't let you win i gotta drink up and be somebody again
[ guitar ]
well i can't spend my whole life grieving i gotta find myself
i gotta put me back together i gotta find me someone else
i don't make you think i'm happy everywhere i go
i gotta keep my hurt inside me i can't let it show
i gotta drink up and be somebody...
confetti fallin' from the sky
my hometown on the 4th of july
a midnight snow on christmas eve
like standin' up for what you believe
that's how i feel when i'm with you
that's how i feel when i'm with you
that's how i feel
that's how i feel when i'm with you
"your lucky coat, the first day of fall"
when you wake up laughin' just because
an old church door that stays wide open
a perfect heart that's never been broken
that's how i feel when i'm with you
every day there's something new
"to cry about, to laugh about"
those moments i can't live without
that's how i feel
that's how i feel
when i'm with you
[thanks to nicole for lyrics]
"oh, sometimes i go walking through fields where we walked"
long ago in the sweet used to be
"and the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet"
as they did when you picked them for me
and when i think of you and the love we once knew
how i wish we could go back in time
do you ever think back on old memories like that
or do i ever cross your mind
do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
"because you miss me, do you darling"
"oh, and do your memories ever take"
you back into another place in time
and do you ever miss the feelings
"and the love we shared when you were with me, tell me darling"
or do i ever cross your mind
"oh, how often i wish that again i could kiss"
your sweet lips like i did long ago
and how often i long for those two loving arms
that once held me so gentle and close
was walking down the street the other day
a sight came before my eyes
it was a little hippie boy
i must have been twice his size
his appearence typed his strange breed
"gaudy clothes, long stringy hair hanging down"
i'd seen perhaps a thousand
in my early trips to town
as he walked on beside me on down the block
i noticed no unpleasing smell.
he might have been on the weed or even lsd
but if he was i couldn't tell...
so we walked together that way through this neighborhood.
finally he turned around to me
"and he said ""friend we're a million miles apart"
but you know something?
we can enjoy the sunshine and the weather.
so why don't we put our differences aside
and just talk to each other?
you see this box beneath my arm?
"to you it's plain, it has no charm"
but to someone dearest to my heart
this box has played a tragic part
this little one can't tell you himself
about his life and how he died.
"but if anyone else could speak for him,"
i guess i'm qualified.
this boy was in chicago he didn't know why he was there.
he was with his family and friends and he didn't really care.
you might have been one of those who saw
the struggle there on your television screen
the tragic thing is so much else happened
that no one else could have seen.
a stranger handed this boy a dollar
to do a simple chore
to carry a package to a nearby hotel.
and when he returned he'd get two more
but when he came back he sort of lost his way walking through the crowd.
"one of them things you ask yourself,"
how the lord allowed
"but when he was found he was like he is now,dreaming sweet and still."
and in his little hand was a crumpled dollar bill.
now you can take that dollar
"get four cents on it, compound it quarterly at any downtown bank."
so they can back some hot new tank or atom bomb.
"well, what i'm going to tell you now, you can stay or you can leave."
you kind o
so upset
nervous wreck
i can't believe she said goodbye
sit and smoke
cry and joke
about these tears in my eyes
how could you do what you gone and done to me
i wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me
but that's what i get
i've come to expect it from you
a million times
a million lines and i bought 'em every one
you don't care
you rip and tear every dream i've counted on
i guess i should thank my unlucky stars
that i'm alive
and you're the way you are
but that's what i get
i've come to expect it from you
i could raise hell
but what the hell it wouldn't do a bit of good
i can leave
my heart agrees it seems to think that i should
there won't be no more next time doing me wrong
you'll come back this time to find that i'm gone
but that's what you get
you should expect that from me
that's what i get
i've come to expect it from you.
when a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new
it always winds up being more like a job interview
my momma used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around
and run
i met the man i call my dad when i was five years old
he took my mom out to a movie and for once i got to go
a few months later i remember lying there in bed
i overheard him pop the question and prayed that she'd say yes
and then all of a sudden
"oh, it seemed so strange to me"
how we went from something's missing
to a family
lookin' back all i can say
about all the things he did for me
is i hope i'm at least half the dad
that he didn't have to be
i met the girl that's now my wife about three years ago
we had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more
now here i stand surrounded by our family and friends
crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in
and now all of a sudden
it seemed so strange to me
how we've gone from something's missing
to a family
lookin' through the glass i think about the man
that's standin' next to me
and i hope i'm at least half the dad
that he didn't have to be
lookin' back all i can say
about all the things he did for me
is i hope i'm at least half the dad
that he didn't have to be
"yeah, i hope i'm at least half the dad"
that he didn't have to be
because he didn't have to be
you know he didn't have to be
i don't want to talk it over anymore
we said it all last night
and time and time again before
you don’t know what you put me through
when you walk out the door
and i don’t want to talk it over anymore
we lasted ‘bout a month again this time
i tried to do you right
but you kept steppin’ over the line
"now you’re gone, and it’s a shame"
"but it’s the best, don’t be concerned"
cause i don’t want to talk it over anymore
each time we try to say “i love you” once again
and every time we end up right back where we been
and i don’t want to talk it over anymore
we said it all last night
and time and time again before
you don’t know what you put me through
when you walk out the door
and i don’t want to talk it over anymore
each time we try to say “i love you” once again
and every time we end up right back where we been
wanting you the way i do
i only want to be with you
and i would go
to the ends of the earth
"â€˜cause, darling"
to me thatâ€™s what
youâ€™re worth
"where you lead, i will follow"
anywhere that you tell me to
"if you need, you need me to be with you"
i will follow where you lead
if youâ€™re out on the road
"feeling lonely, and so cold"
all you have to do is call my name
and iâ€™ll be there on the next train
"where you lead, i will follow"
anywhere that you tell me to
"if you need, you need me to be with you"
i will follow where you lead
i always wanted a real home
with flowers in the window sill
but if you want to live in new york city
"honey, you know i will"
i never thought i could get satisfaction
from just one man
if anyone can keep me happy
youâ€™re the one who can
"where you lead, i will follow"
anywhere that you tell me to
"if you need, you need to be with you"
i will follow
"where you lead, i will follow"
anywhere that you tell me to
"if you need, you need to be with you"
i will follow where you lead
"oh, yes i will"
"oh, iâ€™m gonna follow where you lead"
iâ€™m gonna follow where you lead
"oh, iâ€™m gonna follow where you lead"
i will follow
i will follow
i hope that i won't be that wrong anymore
and maybe i've learned this time
i hope that i find what i'm looking for
"the way that it is,in my mind"
"someday i'll get over you,i live to see it all through"
"but i'll always miss,dreaming my dreams with you"
"i won't let it change me,not if i can"
i'd rather believe in love
and give it away as much as i can
"to those,that i'm fondest of"
she's got big red lips
she's got big brown eyes
when she treats me right
it's a big surprise
she won't do anything
that she said she would
she makes me feel good
she makes me feel good
i ask her come here baby
"she tells me no, no"
i ask me drive me here
she tells me drive your own
she likes to race my motor
then slam my hood
she makes me feel good
she makes me feel good
when the angels look down from above
they see a very special love
how she makes me do what no one could
she makes me feel good
she makes me feel good
so buddy if you're feeling down and blue
and your girlfriend treats you bad too
man just remember what she's bound to do
she'll make you feel good
she'll make you feel good
she's got big red lips
she's got big brown eyes
when she treats me right
it's a big surprise
she won't do anything
that she said she would
she makes me feel good
she makes me feel good
(kenny chesney/david lowe)
well i got a little girl and she's got a daddy
who's got a lotta money and it makes me happy
to follow them around like a little whipped puppy dog
well she's my honey but he's my sugar dad
this country boy ain't doin' too bad
livin' high on someone else's hog
"well, i'm livin' high on someone else's hog"
i sit around all day like a twenty-four karat
bump on a golden log
well i traded that rusty ol' gmc
gotta long black cadillac limousine
i'm a livin' high on someone else's hog
well this redneck boy from a blue-collar town
has really moved up since he got tied down
i got a brand new life and i owe it to my daddy-in-law
well he gave me a so-called executive position
now i get up early every day and go fishin'
i'm a livin' high on someone else's hog
"well, i'm livin' high on someone else's hog"
i sit around all day like a twenty-four karat

"pardon me, you left your tears on the jukebox"
and i'm afraid they got mixed up with mine
"i don't mean to pry, it's just that i"
noticed you goin' out of your mind
it looks like were two of a kind
let's fall to pieces together
why should we both fall apart
let's fall to pieces together
right here in each other's arms
alone is much better together
when the worst is still yet to come
"so let's share the rest, of the tears that are left"
from two hearts that just came undone
why should we go crazy alone
words and music by teddy gentry
drift off and dream in your paper-doll world.
play with the presents from the boys and the girls.
you big day is over. the cake is all gone.
we sang you to sleep with the birthday song.
no. you'll never be one again.
the two's are tumbling on in.
daddy's little girl is growing up in the world.
you'll never be one again.
the toy piano is quiet in the hall as kermie the frog sits watching it all.
and soon your legs will grow and make the tricycle go and take you away from us
all.
"goodnight, baby. goodnight, daddy."
one is a lonely number
one can never have fun
when i met you
i thought i lost the blues
but now i find that i'm back in
that same old boat again.
one is an unhappy number
why do you always make me wait
one and one makes two
that's why i need you
"one is a lonely, lonely number."
one is a lonely number
one is always on it's own
when i met you
i thought i lost the blues
now i find that i'm back in
that same old boat again.
one is an unhappy number
so why do you always make me wait
one and one makes two
that's why i need you
"one is a lonely, lonely number..."
well the moon is broken
and the sky is cracked
come on up to the house
the only thing that you can see
is all that you lack
so come on up to the house
and all your cryin' don't do no good
come on up to the house
come down off the cross
we can use the wood
come on up to the house
come on up to the house
"well, come on up to the house"
this world is not my home
i'm just passin' through
so come on up to the house
there's no light in the tunnel
no irons in the fire
come on up to the house
and your singin' lead soprano
in a junk-man's choir
you gotta come on up to the house
we were alone in the fields with our sheep
a star in the sky glowing bright in the east
when an angelic choir singing all glory be
"to god in the highest, bade us come see (they said)"
the way in a manger is a babe fast asleep
he's never a stranger to wise men who seek
the light and the hope for all of mankind
he's the way in a the manger
and he's easy to find
mary and joseph were there when we came
all that the angels had said was the same
and when i saw the baby i knew just what to do
i bowed down to worship the light and the truth
the way in a manger is a babe fast asleep
he's never a stranger to wise men who seek
the light and the hope for all of mankind
he's the way in a the manger
and he's easy to find
the light and the hope
for all of mankind
he's the way in a manger
and he's easy to find
angel eyes angel eyes
the ways of the world are feeble don't give up on simple people
angle eyes stun those nights
the blues you can live wthout it's not what you song's about
angel eyes angel eyes
tell me what would we're doin' without the light from angel eyes
you can move the hearts of men
just with a phrase you're turning since hearts ever have been yearning
bear with us bear so alone
thin lines you've been living on are so close to the danger zone
angel eyes angel eyes
tell me what would we're doin' without the light from angel eyes
"i've been cheated, mistreated, broken man, defeated"
no one wanted or needed any part of me
i've been bothered and shattered till my heart's torn and tattered
"baby, are you sure you want what's left of me?"
"i've been busted, disgusted, hurt by those i trusted"
there's a big old hurt inside where my heart should be
"i've been lied on and cried on, cheated on and spited on"
even dogs think that i'm a tree
"baby, are you sure you want what's left of me?"
"i've been rocked on and socked on, this heart of mine's been tread on"
i been cryin' so long my eyes can hardly see
"i've been bad lucked, half crocked till my mind is shell shocked"
"baby, are you sure you want what's left of me?"
"i've been busted, disgusted, hurt by those i trusted"
there's a big old hurt inside where my heart should be
"i've been lied on and cried on, cheated on and spited on"
even dogs think that i'm a tree
"baby, are you sure you want what's left of me?..."
[ merle ]
far to sense you'd up and leave that's what you say
don't you know that the road can run both ways
[ bonnie ]
well i'm so sure before each other we're all wrong
and i'm tired of always trying to get along
[ both ]
well that makes two of us you're not the only one
like you i've had enough the end has now began
i guess i'm just as tired of you as you say you are of me
and that makes two of us we both want to be free
[ bonnie ]
i'm all through with trying to make the gold of us
and i've given up on giving in so much
[ merle ]
as far as i'm concerned it's over but to pack
i could walk away and never once look back
[ both ]
well that makes two of us...
and that makes two of us we both want to be free
i believe for every drop of rain that falls a flower grows
i believe that somewhere in the darkest night a candle glows
and i believe for every one who goes astray someone will come to show the way
i believe yes i believe
i believe above the storm the smallest prayer will still be heard
i believe that someone in the great somewhere hears every word
every time i hear a new born baby cry or touch a leaf or see the sky
then i know why i believe
i believe above the storm...
i believe yes i believe
"lookin' back,"
on the memory of
"the dance we shared,"
neath the stars above
"for a moment,"
all the world was right
"how could i have known,"
that you'd ever say goodbye?
"and now,"
i'm glad i didn't know
the way it all would end
the way it all would go
"our lives,"
are better left to chance
"i could have missed the pain,"
but i'da had to miss the dance.
"holding you,"
i held everything
"for a moment,"
wasn't i a king?
"but if i'd only known,"
how the king would fall
"hey who's to say,"
you know i might have changed it all
"and now,"
i'm glad i didn't know
the way it all would end
the way it all would go
"our lives,"
are better left to chance
"i could have missed the pain,"
but i'da had to miss the dance
"it's my life,"
it's better left to chance
i could have missed the pain
"but i'da had to miss,"
the dance
mama didn't have special trainin'
"she couldn't read the music, just the words"
but when she'd stand to sing on sunday mornin'
"she had the sweetest voice i think i've, i've ever heard."
she loved to sing the songs about our savior
"""there is a fountain"", was her favorite one"
and i've seen tears run down the cheeks of sinners
by the time my mama's song was done.
when mama sang the angels stopped to listen
you could see the love light shinin' in her face
when mama sang the angels stopped to listen
now in heaven' choir she had a special places.
(spoken)
you know my daddy wanted me to sing a song
the day that mama left us
and you know that little church
was filled with all of mama's friends
and you know it seems we could all here mama singin'
"when i could hear her sing her favorite, again."
(sang)
when mama sang the angels stopped to listen
you could see the love light shining in her face
when mama sang the angels stopped to listen
now in heaven' choir she had a special places.
when mama sang the angels stopped to listen.

when you take me in your arms and tell me that you love me
i want to think it's really true but my heart won't let me
for when you're kissing me it's plain for me to see
you've got somebody else on your mind
somebody else is with you in your dreams
somebody else now has your love it seems
give her your kisses they're not really mine
you've got somebody else on your mind
[ strings ]
when you're holding her so close and telling her you love her
what would she think if she just knew you also told another
someday she will see you said those words to me
and that's somebody else on your mind
somebody else is with you...
you look at me that way
i know what your eyes say
your eyes reflect love and desire
i see that you need me
i need you to please me
you touch me and set me on fire
it's the way that you love me
the way that you touch me
the way that you whisper my name
i cannot resist you
each time i kiss you
then everything goes up in flames
baby i'm burning out of control
baby i'm burning body and soul
hot as a pistol of flaming desire
baby i'm burning
you got me on fire
i'm on fire
this red hot emotion
puts fireworks in motion
it looks like the fourth of july
there's no use in fighting
the fire you've ignited
just stand back and watch the sparks fly
baby i'm burning
baby i'm burning
baby i'm burning
baby i'm burning
fade:
"the road is long, with many a winding turn"
"that leads us to who knows where, who knows where"
"but i'm strong, strong enough to carry him"
he ain't heavy - he's my brother
"so on we go, his welfare is my concern"
"no burden is he to bare, we'll get there"
for i know he would not encumber me
he ain't heavy - he's my brother
"if i'm laden at all, i'm laden with sadness"
that everyone's heart isn't filled with gladness of love for one another
it's a long long road from which there is no return
"while we're on our way to there, why not share"
"and the load, it doesn't weigh me down at all"
he ain't heavy - he's my brother
"he ain't heavy - he's my brother, he's my brother, he's my brother"
"yea, hollywood boulevard"
"looking down, seeing stars"
"90210, rodeo is rodeo"
"glad i hit it, glad i did it and i'd do it again"
"yea, and hang with my friends"
with them red maserati's and them tuned up bodies
and everybody gonna be the next somebody
"yea, this place is a trip"
hey but meanwhile back in the stick
somebody's having a small town big time night
somebody's rocking the main street with red tail lights
somebody's cranking it up or falling in love
or keeping the buzz sipping on a little moonlight
"yea, they know how to rock"
out in the boondocks
cause believe me i've been there
"somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere"
"yea, two lane town squares"
"cotton queens, county fairs"
with a water tank
got 100 girls' names under the paint
"glad i hit it, glad i did it and i'd do it again"
"yea, i miss my friends"
with them pick'em up trucks and them dirt road ruts
and all them country girls get to strutting their stuff
"east, west, north or south"
"yea you better believe, [?]"
somebody's having a small town big time night
somebody's rocking the main street with red tail lights
somebody's cranking it up or falling in love
or lighting it up with a kfc spotlight
"yea, they all got the swerve"
down back in their hometown
i wish that i was there
"somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere"
somebody's having a small town big time night
somebody's rocking the main street with red tail lights
somebody's cranking it up or falling in love
and twisting it up and dodging them blue lights
"yea, they know how to kick it"
way out past the limits
cause baby i've been there
"somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere"
"yea, somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere"
i wish that i was there
"yea, i wish that i was there"
here on the hilltop where we fell in love
"many moons later, now we're giving up"
"i start the engine, you start to cry"
it's a beautiful memory but a sad sad goodbye.
"how many times have we wished on a star,"
wrapped up in a quilt on the hood of my car
we saw halley's comet in lunar eclipse
and i sure saw heaven when i tasted your lips.
"so blow out the stars, turn off the moon"
fade out the crickets and the nightingale's tune
take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind
another love story has come to an end
when our love was new as the first evening star
we both said i'll worship you just as you are
"then i tried to change you, girl, and i don't know why"
"you tried to change me, hey we might as well try."
"to blow out the stars, turn off the moon"
fade out the crickets and the nightingale's tune
take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind
another love story has come to an end.
take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind
another love story has come to an end
"i was a highwayman, along the coach roads i did ride,"
with sword and pistol by my side.
many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade.
many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
the bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five:
but i am still alive.
"i was a sailor, i was born upon the tide."
and with the sea i did abide.
i sailed a schooner round the horn to mexico.
i went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow.
"and when the yards broke off, they said that i got killed:"
but i am living still.
i was a dam builder across the river deep and wide;
where steel and water did collide.
"a place called boulder on the wild colorado,"
i slipped and fell into the wet concrete below.
they buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound:
but i am still around.
"i'll always be around,."
and around and around and around and around.
"and when i reach the other side,"
i'll find a place to rest my spirit if i can.
perhaps i may become a highwayman again.
or i may simply be a single drop of rain;
but i will remain.
"and i'll be back again,"
and again and again and again and again.
you get a pen and i'll get a paper we're gonna write ourselves a song
we'll drive the poetics crazy i don't think the damn thing's gonna rhyme
[ steel ]
i got a friend and i think he's goofy i guess he thinks the same about me
guess it really takes one to know one and you look like an old friend of mine
[ piano ]
out all night and acting crazy i've been up for two whole days
turn me over and roll me over wind me up for one more rhyme
[ harmonica ]
well he called me friend and he called me brother
i called him back but he was gone
he took my songs and he took my money
but the jokes on him he's the friend of a fool of a fool of a fool
[ dobro ]
you get a pen and i'll get a paper...

i look into those blue eyes
something happens to me
although i know again tonight
i'll hear nothing but true lies
that string of broken hearts all over town
should be enough to tell me
"i should be turning you down, then"
i look into those blue eyes
something happens to me
although i know again tonight
i'll hear nothing but true lies
true lies will hurt me less than losing you
so darling lie to me
when i get lost in those blue eyes
i should know better than to let you in
we're just beginning
"and i can already see the end, when"
i look into those blue eyes
something happens to me
although i know again tonight
i was livin on a landslide
fallin fast until you took my
"hand, now i won't ever let you go"
let you go
four-leaf clover and a horses shoe
knockin on wood was all i ever knew
i'm savin all my wishing well pennies and
i got so many ever since you came along
"sunlight shinin, baby, roll the dice"
now that i got you by my side
we can't lose
no more waitin on a shooting star
i'm betting it all on your pretty heart
"baby, you're my lucky charm"
like an angel from the blue sky
sent to save me from my dark side
"yeah, the light inside was fading"
but i found salvation when i fell into your eyes
all i know is
"i got your love, i got your love, baby"
"yes, i do"
"i got your love, i got your love, baby"
"oh, i got it, baby"
"i got your love, i got your love, baby"
"whoa, oh, oh, whoa"
we both have a morning cup of coffee
and with tender love you reach and touch my hand
and my son comes in and says good morning daddy
and i say how's daddy's little man
then i woke up from dreaming i woke up from dreaming
i keep dreaming you're not gone but i'd found myself alone
when i woke up from dreaming
we're both making plans for the future
of the joy that we want to give our son
we'd say almost enough to buy a new home
a home filled with love and fun
then i woke up from dreaming...
then i woke up from dreaming
i'm sittin' in the railway station got a ticket for my destination
on a tour of one night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand
every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one man band
homeward bound i wish i was homeward bound
home where my thought's escaping home where the music's playing
home where my love was waitin' silently for me
now every day's an endless stream of cigarettes and magazines
and each town looks the same to me for movies and the factories
and every stranger's face i see reminds me that i long to be
homeward bound...
[ strings ]
tonight i'll sing my songs again i'll play the game and pretend
but all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
like emptiness and harmony i need someone to comfort me
homeward bound...
i grew up in small town
wheat fiels foreign downtown kinda place
there really wasn't much around
you blink and you miss it
i never knew what life could bring
but i always had big dreams
i loved to play my guitar and sing
and every night i'd wish that i'd get a shot
on the opry stage and have people come and see me play
"blastin on the radio waves, enough to make my mama cry"
cause that's where i come from
that's who i am
hard workin and god blessed
yes sir and thank you ma'am
the best things around that i have ever seen
came from small towns and big dreams
small town went and grew up
but i never changed much by god's grace
friends and family kept in touch when i moved to tennesse
sing my songs and travel round
i met a girl and we're settlin' down
wanna find a small town where we can raise a family
cause that's where i come from
that's who i am
hard workin and god blessed
yes sir and thank you ma'am
the best things around that i have ever seen
came from small towns and big dreams
been around the world
don't matter any where i go
"even here in fort mcmurray, flin flon...medicine hat,"
i find my kind of folks
it's about you and who you are
it's all a state of mind
and as i'm giving you my heart and hope you find
that's where i come from
that's who i am
hard workin and god blessed
yes sir and thank you ma'am
the best things around that i have ever seen
just look around you'll see just what i mean
the best things around that i have ever seen
came from small towns and big dreams
that's where i come from
that's who i am
that's where i come from
small towns (that's who i am)
big dreams (that's where i come from)
small towns (that's who i am)
alright
that's where i come from
that's who i am (that's it)
that's where i come from
that's who i am (little louder)
that's where i come from
that's who i am (come on)
that's where i come from
that's who i am
that's perfect
no affection were the words that stuck on my mind
when she walked out on me for the very last time
oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
i don't know what i've done to be treated this way
in a cold dirty room that's where i found myself
with a bottle of wine and some pills off the shelf
oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
i don't know what i've done and i'm feeling so ashamed
then an angel appeared she was just 17
in a dirty old town with a conscious so clean
oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
she's brought back the life that i once threw away
when i think back on these times
and the dreams we left behind
i'll be glad cause i was blessed to get
to have you in my life
when i look back on these days
i'll look and see your face
you were right there for me
in my dreams i'll always see you soar above the sky
in my heart there'll always be a place for you for all my life
i'll keep a part of you with me
and everywhere i am there you'll be
and everywhere i am there you'll be
well you showed me how it feels
to feel the sky within my reach
and i always will remember all
the strength you gave to me
your love made me make it through
ohh i owe so much to you
you were right there for me
in my dreams i'll always see you soar above the sky
in my heart there'll always be a place for you for all my life
i'll keep a part of you with me
and everywhere i am there you'll be
"cause i always saw in you my light, my strength"
and i want to thank you now for all the ways
"you were right there for me,"
you were right there for me always
in my dreams i'll always see you soar above the sky
in my heart there'll always be a place for you for all my life
i'll keep a part of you with me
and everywhere i am there you'll be
and everywhere i am there you'll be
there you'll be
"adalida, pretty little cajun queen"
"sweet dixie flower, the belle of the bayou"
you're every young man's dream
"adalida, i'd walk through a hurricane"
to stand beside you sweet adalida
i'd swim the pontchartrain
"oh no, here you comin' down the road"
"with your cotton dress a swishin', you gettin' some attention"
from all the boys in thibodaux
oh my you're really fillin' up their eyes
"smilin' and a winkin', i know what they're thinkin'"
but i'm the only one who loves you so!
"oh no, the hottest little dish i know"
"i know you can tell it, you makin' me so jealous"
from my head down to my toes
oh me you could make a redneck green
"the way that you're a lookin', you got me cookin'"
and i ain't talkin' 'bout etoufee'
southern star
alabama
album: southern star
"oh, southern star, how i wish you would shine"
and show me the way to get home
well i'm blue-collar branded and stuck in a mill
hard work is a way of life for me
well i'm too young to live like i'm over the hill
and too old to be wild and free
my heart is homeward bound
i'm rolling with the feeling and i can't slow down
i need a guiding light
shining down to lead me through the night
"oh southern star, how i wish you would shine"
and show me the way to get home
"oh, hey my d.j. friend, would you play me one more song"
and let my mind just go and drift away
now we all have a dream and a place where we belong
somewhere we can go and escape
my heart is homeward bound
i'm rolling with the feeling and i can't slow down
i need a guiding light
shining down to lead me throught the night
"oh, southern star, how i wish you would shine"
and show me the way to get home
"oh, southern star, how i wish you would shine"
and show me the way to get home

if you loved me half as much as i love you
you wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
you're nice to me when there's no one else around
you only build me up to let me down
if you miss me half as much as i miss you
you wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
i know that i would never be this blue
if you only loved me half as much as i love you
if you loved me half as much as i love you
you wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
i know that i would never be this blue
if you only loved me half as much as i loved you

and then we're gonna show them all a thing or two
we're gonna demonstrate just what a champion can do

i swear i don't know how?
huuh-right between the goal posts!

chestnuts roasting on an open fire
jack frost nipping at your nose
yuletide carols being sung by a choir
and folks dressed up like eskimos
everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
can help to make the season bright
tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
will find it hard to sleep tonight
they know that santa's on his way
he's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
and every mother's child is gonna spy
to see if reindeer really know how to fly
"and so, i'm offering this simple phrase"

"although it's been said many times, many ways"

[g] you wore out a brand new trunk
packin' and un-[d7] packin' your [g] junk
your daddy's mad; he's done got pee-eeved

this ain't right and that is wrong
"you just keep naggin', all the day long"
"its gotta stop, i don't mean plea-ease"
"now, you're gonna change or i'm a-gonna leave."
the way to keep a woman happy
and make her do what's right
"is love her ev'ry mornin', bawl her out at night"
your daddy's mad; he's done got pee-eeved
"now, you're gonna change or i'm a-gonna leave."

from herte mississippi to tupelo then i caught an eastbound freight
with sky high hopes opened out scopes and hurt all over my face
new york city is a bad place to be when you're out of your head
country style running wild country style
the new wears off and time wears off and my roots are showin' through
but nobody cares about from where you came but what they can get out of you
and new york city is a bad place to be...
what would mom and daddy say if they saw me this a way
would they pray for me yes they would
but nobody's heard about rainy day women in that herte mississippi neighborhood
and new york city is a bad place to be...
new york city is a bad place to be...
he came to me like a bright idea
shining like the sun
and the way his eyes burned into mine
i knew he must be the one
"oh, he drew me in like a magnet does"
so i couldn't pull away
but the kind of lovin' that i gave to him
i'm not ashamed to say
"oh, as soon as i touched him"
soon as i touched him
i felt like a woman
and the feelin' made me close my eyes
i was born again
an' i heard myself cryin'
like a new born baby cries
he told me what i meant to him
swore that i was sent to him
all my lovin' went to him
"now he's gone, oh, he's gone"
now i hide myself from the light of day
so no one else can see
a part of him that i can't forget
that's growin' deep inside of me
"oh, as soon as i touched him"
soon as i touched him
i felt like a woman
and the feelin' made me close my eyes
i was born again
an' i heard myself cryin'
like our new born baby cries
fade:
the old maid's waitin' for leap year to come
the crooner's just waitin' to sing
the old cow's standin' by the bull durham sign
just awaitin' for the grass to turn green
the bar-fly's waitin' for an easy mark
an' the hitch-hiker's waitin' for a ride
the life-termer's waitin' for a prison break
the beachcomber's waitin' for the tide
farmer's daughter's waitin' for the salesman
to take her into town
the city slicker's waitin' for the country boy
to lay all his money down
you know everything comes to a standstill
nothin' seems to make a turn
worm must be waitin' for the early bird
i guess the early bird's waitin' for the worm
nobody wants to do nothin'
just waitin' to get a finger in the pie
waitin' for a call from a big quiz show
or hopin' and awaitin' for some rich uncle to die
"katy, she's waitin' at the garden gate"
the moonshiner's waitin' at the still
an' the gambler's still waitin' for that ace in the hole
"i guess, jack's still waitin' for jill"
everybody's waitin' for somethin'
nothin' seems to turn out right
'cause the night shift's waitin' for mornin'
and the burglar just waitin' for night
the congregation's waitin' for the preacher
preacher just waitin' for the groom
the groom's just waitin' for the june bride
and the bride's just waitin' for june
sunflowers waitin' for the sunshine
violets just waitin' for dew
bees just waitin' for honey
"and, honey, i'm just waitin' for you"
i wish there was some way to tell you i'm sorry
that i didn't leave you a long time ago
but many mistakes are the part of my story
heartache by heartache i've turned you to stone
call me a traveler gonna catch me a train
i wanna see frisco feel the sunhine again
if you want true love you can't stand alone
life here together has turned you to stone
i've held you captive in a life without sunshine
i've watched the blue in your eyes fade away
all good is gone now no need to continue
destroying each other oh day after day
call me a traveler gonna catch me a train...
life here together has turned you to stone
(paul brandt)
your blue eyes looked so peaceful
while the storm raged on in me
the tears filled up my eyes and now i finally see
i've been livin' high and mighty
but now i'm at an all-time low
now i'm reaching out to hold you
as you turn around to go
i should've been more careful
i should've seen the signs
"while all was calm, i guess"
i should've read between the lines
"so, now i'm standin' in the cold, hard rain"
instead of with you safe and warm
a fool who took your love for granted
in the calm before the storm
"so, i'm standin' here alone"
i've never felt like this before
can't believe my heart's been broken
just like waves against the shore
i could always love and leave them
i was the first one out the door
i can't get used to the idea
not being with you anymore
i should've been more careful
i should've seen the signs
"while all was calm, i guess"
i should've read between the lines
"so, now i'm standin' in the cold, hard rain"
instead of with you safe and warm
a fool who took your love for granted
in the calm before the storm
a fool who took your love for granted
"again,"
at the end of the rainbow
"again,"
no gold to be found
just this cold unmade bed
the last 3 words you said
and this buzzing on the telephone line
"paris, well, there is fog on the seine"
amsterdam still courses through my veins
"all these dark crazy sights,"
wouldn't be so bad
if i could just taste your breath once again
honey i saw your daddy
lying by the roadside
his feet sticking out of a sack
honey they'll be calling
to tell you that your daddy
never will be coming back
again
at the end of the rainbow
"again,"
no words to be found
just this voice sad and alone
me wishing i was home
and the silence on the telephone line
i walked out to the graveyard
down by the church of god
i looked upon the one i love
that would soon be covered with sod
up along the ohio river
over on the old kentucky shore
once dwelled a fair young maiden
now there's a crepe upon her door
the angels took my darling
god needed the one i loved
i reached the old kentucky shore today
i'll make my plans and meet her up above
the last words that my darling said
was tell the one i love goodbye
i would like to see him before i go
but i'll meet him in the sky
you better watch out
you better not cry
you better not pout
i'm telling you why

"i'm standin' at these crossroads, tryin' to find myself"
walls are full of pictures and memories on the shelf
never thought that i was ever gonna be here
"tearin' all these walls down, made from my mistakes"
"tryin' to build a new home, one without the pain"
"every story ends, never thought i'd say this"
"let's finish what we started, babe"
finish what we started
and i'll go down that road that we always did
let's take our mistakes and try to make it right
we were younger then
let's finish what we started
'cause i know now what i didn't know back then
"it's breakin' my heart, but we're both gonna be alright"
"lookin' at the future, not lookin' for the blame"
didn't make us happy livin' different ways
"i would die for you, but i couldn't stay here"
look at all the love we built
it will carry on and on and on
"and even though it hurts, this will lead us to better days"
"let's finish what we started, babe (let's finish what we started)"
finish what we started
and i'll go down that road that we always did (let's finish what we started)

"jeff cook/teddy gentry/ronnie rogers/greg fowler, 3:43"
i worry all day and i can't go to sleep at night
thinking about baby and wondering who's holding her tight tonight
"people say i've been a fool too long, too long"
all my friends still ask me why i keep hanging on and on
and i say
you'll never know until it happens to you
you'll never know all that i'm going through
love ain't something that flies away
somebody goes but the feeling stays
and you'll never know until it happens to you
saturday's rollin' and everybody's rockin' but me
"i should go to town but i don't want no company, no, no, no"
friends say i should be out having fun with someone
i know it's true but if they only knew it's easier said than done
oh yeah
"friends say i've been a fool too long, much too long"
they just don't understand why i sit at home all alone by the phone
and i say
you'll never know until it happens to you
you'll never know all that i'm going through
"you'll never know, oh no"
"you'll never know, whoa"
you'll never know until it happens to you

i knew the stakes were high right from the start
when she dealt the cards i bet my heart
now i just found a game that i can't play and this is where the cowboy rides away
and my heart is sinking like the setting sun setting on the things i wish i'd done
it's time to say goodbye to yesterday and this is where the cowboy rides away
[ guitar ]
we've been in and out of love and in between
and now we've played the final showdown scene
as the credits roll the sad song starts to play this is where the cowboy rides away
and my heart is sinking like the setting sun setting on the things i wish i'd done
oh the last goodbye's the hardest one to say this is where the cowboy rides away
oh the last goodbye's the hardest one to say this is where the cowboy rides away
oh the people would come from far away
they'd dance all night till the break of day
"when the caller hollered ""do-se-do"""
you knew uncle pen was ready to go
late in the evening about sundown
high on the hill and above the town
uncle pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
"you could hear it talk, you could hear it sing"
"he played an old piece he called ""soldier's joy"""
"and the one called ""the boston boy"""
"the greatest of all was ""jenny lynn"""
to me that's where the fiddle begins
i'll never forget that mournful day
when uncle pen was called away
"they hung up his fiddle, they hung up his bow"
they knew it was time for him to go
do you think i'll keep on waitin' for your love while you keep date
other fellows in this town that think you're free
i can't give something dear for nothing surely this time i'm not bluffing
i won't love you any more than you love me
you like worldly ways and riches pretty clothes and fancy stitches
and you think you're living best with all of these
but i know one thing for certain my old heart can't stand this hurtin'
it's not right to love you more than you love me
i can't run around with everyone to play with you
so why must i be the one who's always so confused
this love affair is far from even and i believe in even steven
i won't love you any more than you love me
it's not right to love you more than you love me
you never send me flowers or ever buy me candy
you never bring me pretty things when you come to see me
and you forgot my birthday oh i wish you could see
how i miss the little things that you don't do for me
you never say that i look nice or that you're proud of me
you overlook the little things that you should see
these little things are big enough to hurt but too small to make me want to leave
but i do miss the little things that you don't do for me
now how can i miss flowers that never reached my door
how can i taste candy that's still at the candy store
these little things mean a lot to me to you they may be silly
but i do miss the little things that you don't do for me
yes i miss the little things that you don't do for me

i stayed out too late last night
on a little spree
and when i asked her to let me in
here's all she said to me
no not now
(no not now)
no not now
(no not now)
no not now
but maybe next week
somehow
"i feel terrible, sunlight's hurting my eyes"
so i pull the shades and i make my place as black as night
"i feel miserable, and i'm missing you and me"
another sunday morning all alone underneath these sheets
"no, i'm not hungover it's true, but i'm still not over you"
all messed up. all strung out
i was sitting at home breaking down
not out there getting high underneath some neon lights
ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
i'm just getting over another sober saturday night
besides the pain. i don't feel a thing
when my buddies call me up i just let it ring
"no, i'm not hungover it's true, but i'm still not over you"
all messed up. all strung out
i was sitting at home breaking down
not out there getting high underneath some neon lights
ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
i'm just getting over another sober saturday night
"no, i'm not out there getting"
high underneath some neon lights
ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
i'm just getting over another sober saturday night
"some have said,done through history"
if you last it's a mistery
"but i guess they don't know,what they're talking about"
from the mountains down to the sea
you've become such a habit with me
"america,a-merher-ica"
"well i come from,down around tennesee"
but the people in california
"are nice to me,a-merher-ica"
it don't matter where i may roam
tell you people that it's home sweet home
"america,a-merher-ica"
"and my brothers are all black and white,yellow too"
"and the red man is right,to expect a little from you"
"promise and then follow through,america"
"and the men,who fell on the planes"
"and lived,through hardship and pain"
"america,a-merher-ica"
and the men who could not fight
in a war that didn't seem right
"you let them come home,a-merher-ica"
"well i come from,down around tennesee"
but the people in california
"are nice to me,a-merher-ica"
it don't matter where i may roam
tell you people that it's home sweet home
"america,a-merher-ica"
"america,a-merher-ica"
"it's home sweet home,a-merher-ica"
"america,a-merher-ica"
when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair
talking to those rich folks that you know
well i hope you won't see me in my ragged company
you know that i could never be alone
"take me down little susie, take me down"
i know you think you're the queen of the underground
and you can send me dead flowers every morning
send me dead flower by the mail
send me dead flowers to my wedding
and i won't forget to put roses on your grave
well when you're sitting back in your pink rose cadillac
making bets on kentucky derby days
i'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
and another girl can take my pain away
"take me down little susie, take me down"
i know you think you're the queen of the underground
and you can send me dead flowers every morning
send me dead flower by us mail
send me dead flowers to my wedding
and i won't forget to put roses on your grave
"take me down little susie, take me down"
i know you think you're the queen of the underground
and you can send me dead flowers every morning
send me dead flower by the us mail
send me dead flowers at my wedding
and i won't forget to put roses on your grave
no i won't forget to put roses on your grave
theres a boat race down the river
theres a slow boat on my mind
everybody's going like crazy
i'm taking my own sweet time
i'll drift down to big shark river
take a boat ride along the bay
just trying to find
a little peace of mind
down in the everglades
there ain't gonna be no hurry
there ain't gonna be no rush
just a lazy style like a crocodile
playin' in the mangrove brush
i'll float on down the river
let the speed boat speed away
i'll drift around making gator sounds
down in the everglades
while the big crowd down the rivers
are gettin' drunk on sea grape wine
i'm gettin' high watchin' eagles fly
havin' myself a time
wet my whistle every now and then
with a sip of cool gatorade
watch the sun go down
and let the world go 'round
down in the everglades
i'll drift around
makin' gator sounds
down in the everglades
is he tall? is he handsome?
does he make enough and then some
does he miss you every minute that he's gone
is he funny? is he witty?
does he tell you that you're pretty
did he hang the moon? did he do no wrong?
"is he mr. right, i wonder what he's like"
the one you're waiting on
'cause there's an empty seat beside you
and every guy here's trying to buy you
"something to drink, but you just keep brushing them off"
you're watching whatever's on cable
swirling your glass on the table
wondering how long is too long
is he working late? is he worth the wait?
the one you're waiting on
how many glasses of cabernet
how many minutes slip away
how many times were you gonna check your phone
i'm telling you if you were mine
you wouldn't be sitting here counting the time
you'd never spend a single moment alone
i bet he don't get how lucky he is
the one you're waiting on
how many glasses of cabernet
how many boys can you turn away
how long 'til you turn off your phone
"and look up at me, i'd be happy to be"
the one you're waiting on
i'd be happy to be
the one you're waiting on
"you gotta snazzy new car in your driveway,"
expensive new clothes on your back.
every short skirt on the highway
has spent time in your bachelor pad.
we dance and you look o'er my shoulder
and make eyes at somebody else.
"you swear that you're not,"
but you know that's a crock
'cause you only care for yourself.
your attitude stinks and i hate it.
"you're arrogant, cocky and rude."
"you're selfish, conceited and jaded."
everything's all about you;
you think that i'm lucky to have you.
"you think you're so handsome, so what?"
i'm calling you out 'cause i don't need this crap.
i'm gettin' myself out of dodge.
'cause you don't know love from shinola.
"with you, love is not what i found."
a woman needs someone to hold her
not someone to just lay her down.
"i want someone i can count on, a cool head,"
"a warm heart and shoulder to cry on,"
"rely on, today and from now on."
but you don't know love from shinola.
you don't know love from shinola.
"oh, but i gave you love and affection,"
but you never gave one iota.
it was an early detection that you don't know love from shinola.
you don't know love from shinola.
you don't know what true love's about.
'cause you'll find your world growin' colder
when you're alone and without.
"so go on, lover boy, have a big time,"
drink up on your bourbon and cola.
when you sober up you'll be bleep out of luck
'cause you don't know love from shinola.
"i'm in it for love but you're just playing stud,"
'cause you don't know love from shinola.
"you don't know love, you don't know love."
"you don't know love,"
'cause you don't know love from shinola.
"you don't know love, you don't know love."
"you don't, you don't, you don't know love."
this is our last night together you just gave me my walkin' shoes
this is our last night together you just gave me my walkin' shoes

military mail call....
"i lay out some paper, i take out my pen"
turn on my table-lamp and here i go again
"it's time to write a letter, i'm in the mood tonight"
gotta find a way to tell you how i feel inside
so i write a little and i cry a little
it's so hard to find a way to say goodbye a little
"but somewhere in the middle, my emotions interfere"
so i write a little and cry a little tear
"and i die a little, wishing you were here"
"god i miss you, can't be with you"
i would kiss you oh so good
'cause you're my only cure for lonely
i'd call if i could
so i write a little and i cry a little
it's so hard to find a way to say goodbye a little
"but somewhere in the middle, my emotions interfere"
so i write a little and cry a little tear
"and i die a little, wishing you were here"
"oh, i die a little wishing you were here"
wishing you were here
i'm writing and wishing you were here
i write a little and cry a little tear
i'm writing and wishing you were here
the truth is too painful
this moment too real
saying good-bye
but loving you still
too late to start over
we've tried that before
and i just don't have it in me
to try anymore
but i know i'll miss you
and i know i'll cry
i know you loved me
and i know you've tried
it's the hardest thing
i'll ever do in my life
but i know no good way
of saying good-bye
i know i'll miss you
and i know i'll cry
i know you loved me
and i know i'll ask why
i know i'll have moments
when i'll want to die
but i know no good way
of saying good-bye
tag:
and the longest night
i'll ever spend will be tonight
'cause i know no good way of saying
(woo-ooh-ooh)
"yeah, baby"
out here ain't nothing but woods and water
"drop a deer from a stand, catch a fish with a bobber"
"drink a beer out the can, liquor out the bottle"
"how the good lord intended it, yes he did"
"i love my country, i love my country"
"six strings and fiddles, whiskey from kentucky"
"we keep it funky, we like how it sounds"
"monday to sunday, yeah, i love my country"
"i'm loud and proud, rolling into town"
"hanging out the window, like a blue tick hound"
"ain't sorry, ain't nothing to be sorry about"
i love my country and i love my country
up loud
(woo-ooh-ooh)
"barbecue, steak fries"
styrofoam plate date night
george strait singing greats while
"we turning up, sitting lake-side"
"that pedal steel, she straight sliding"
"over here, to me she do that"
"alabama shake, like you ain't ever seen"
"i love my country, i love my country"
"six strings and fiddles, whiskey from kentucky"
"we keep it funky, we like how it sounds"
"monday to sunday, yeah, i love my country"
"i'm loud and proud, rolling into town"
"hanging out the window, like a blue tick hound"
"ain't sorry, ain't nothing to be sorry about"
"i love my country, and i love my country"
up loud
(woo-ooh-ooh)
i love my country up loud
i'm talking way up loud
"i like pop, and rock, and rap, i like skynyrd"
and going out downtown when i'm with her
like driving too fast down a 4-lane road
but damn sure nowhere close to the way that
"i love my country, i love my country"
"six strings and fiddles, whiskey from kentucky"
"we keep it funky, we like how it sounds"
"monday to sunday, yeah, i love my country"
"i'm loud and proud, rolling into town"
"hanging out the window, like a blue tick hound"
"ain't sorry, ain't nothing to be sorry about"
"i love my country, and i love my country"
up loud
"yeah, baby"
(woo-ooh-ooh)
i love my country up loud
"yeah, way up loud"
"that's a country-ass lick right there, boy"
"for as long as i remember, when friday night came round"
the family would gather out at grandpa's house.
with supper over and the dishes done
it was then the best time came
at an old upright piano that only grandma played.
"she played beautiful dreamer, my wild irish rose;"
"she never played 'em perfect, but there was love in every note."
"grandpa sat beside her, in harmony they sang,"
at the old upright piano that only grandma played.
"grandpa was a stubborn man, they said it was his style."
"grandma called him ornery, but she said it with a smile."
even he could not disguise the love he felt so strong;
we all could see it in his eyes when she played his favorite song.
"she played beautiful dreamer, my wild irish rose;"
"she never played 'em perfect, but there was love in every note."
"grandpa sat beside her, in harmony they sang,"
at the old upright piano that only grandma played.
i was almost 17 when my grandma died;
i stayed all night with grandpa; the old man never cried.
"he sat at her piano, there was nothing we could say"
it was the first time in my life i ever heard my grandpa play.
it wasn't beautiful dreamer or my wild irish rose
it was a song he played from memory & he never missed a note
i sat right there beside him until the morning came
what a friend we have in jesus was the only song he played.
"she played beautiful dreamer, my wild irish rose;"
"she never played 'em perfect, but there was love in every note."
"grandpa sat beside her, in harmony they sang,"
at the old upright piano that only grandma played.
well i've been lost in this town
even though i know my way around
didn't take me long until i found the devil
with just one word i knew his voice
is the one i heard in every choice i made
just trying to be a rebel
"in a small town, in a small town"
if you jumped off of our front porch
you'd land right where the civil war was fought
and it's never been forgotten
it's twenty miles to the interstate
there's a burger king and a motel 8
and the only thing between here and there is cotton
and jeffrey prays to jesus asking him please just help us through one more day
"jenny gets high, she wastes her life, but me i just ran away"
"from a small town, from a small town"
"sometimes it was heaven, sometimes hell"
"kinda like church, kinda like jail"
there's a water tower says 'welcome to nowhere'
as soon as i could i was long gone
my jeans were torn and my hair was long
now i can't believe i wanna go back there
"to a small town, to a small town"
jeffrey prays to jesus asking him please just help us through one more day
"jenny gets high, she wastes her life, but me i just ran away"
but i knew i'd come back some day
"to a small town, to a small town"
"oh to a small town, to a small town"
whooo-whooo ...
whooo-whooo ...
whooo-whooo ...
whooo-whooo ...
oh to a small town
i could tell that it was over
when her lips met mine
it was an emptiness in her voice
hesitation when she smiled
she didn't have to say a word
it was just so plain to see
she had found what she'd been looking for
and i knew it wasn't me
i saw goodbye in her eyes
i don't think i can change it
there's no way to disguise
we will never make it
sometimes i feel like a clown
who can't wash off his make-up
all she wanted it was gone
prince charming i wasn't
but i would trade a thousand babylons
to be in her arms tomorrow
but like tide her love has come and gone
and it's time for me to go
i saw goodbye in her eyes
i don't think i can change it
there's no way to disguise
we will never make it
now she sees right through me
should i hold on to what we've got
is is just a waste of time
one thing that i know for sure
i saw goodbye in her eyes
i saw goodbye in her eyes
i know you got somebody new now
all my candles have burned out
he's gonna love the way you shine
so did i
so don't smile at me if it ain't what you need
with that goodbye in your eyes
i know that i can't change it
(know you see right through me)
there's no way to disguise
we will never make it
i saw goodbye in your eyes
i know that i can't change it
"(now you see right through me, goodbye!)"
should i hold on
we will never make it
"(now you see right through me, goodbye!)"
should i hold on
is it just a waste of time
one thing that i know for sure
i saw goodbye in your eyes
i saw goodbye in your eyes
i know that it's over
someones walking around up stairs i can hear him
and he just got up from sleeping in our bed
i will wake up and realize i was dreamin
even when i am strong awake i cant get it out my head
cause i know someone is going to take my place and walk up that ol stairway
to the room where i walked out on you
please understand i couldnt stay
i see a two story house with someone new warming up my bed
someone walking around up stairs and i cant get it ut of my head
cause i know someone is going to take my place and walk up that ol stairway
to the room where i walked out on you
please understand i couldnt stay
i see a two story house with someone new warming up my bed
someones walking around upstairs and i cant get it out of my head
"finally friday, kenny chesney"
i got a hundred dollars smoking in my bill fold
i know i outta save it but it's burning a hole
right through my pocket and into my skin
come monday morning i'll be broke again
"cause it's finally friday, i'm free again"
i got my motor running for a wild weekend
"it's finally friday, i'm outta control"

"cause it's finally friday, i'm free again"
i got my motor running for a wild weekend

"finally friday, i got my motor running for a wild weekend"
"it's finally friday,"
forget the workin blues and let the good times roll
yeah i have my addictions
and keep my share of secrets
and things you'll never see
i get selfish and defensive
and pay too much attention
to my insecurities
oh i'm just like everybody else
i try to love jesus and myself
i don't know what you believe
or what you think of what you see
but this is a part of me
what i do and who i am
all my impurities
are right here on my sleeve
this is me
this is me
my heart break for the homeless
i worry about my parents
and all my bills are late
i'm dealing with the changes
this complicated strangeness
of seeing life this way
i'm just like everybody else
i try to love jesus and myself
i laugh at silly movies
tear up when i see babies
and i'm stubborn as a stone
i criticize my body
i wonder if i'm ready
to ever be alone
oh i'm just like everybody else
i cry like everybody else
(kent blazy/skip ewing)
when i was a boy
i'd get so annoyed
whenever it was pouring rain
standin' at the glass door
starin' at the outside nose pressed against the pane
i told my momma
i don't wanna be stuck inside no more
"give me thunder and lightnin', somethin' excitin'"
that's what i'm livin' for
there's a world out there and i wanna be in it
i got a life and i'm gonna live it
don't tell me the sky's the limit
there's footprints on the moon
i wanna do my walkin' down the road less traveled
sew my dreams where they won't unravel
if you play it safe you won't get nowhere
i can't stay in here when there's a world out there
i remember back in school
they thought i was a fool
for askin' lizzy walker to the dance
she was always with the captain of the football team
nobody thought i even have a chance
but imagine my surprise
when she looked me in the eyes
and said i'll go with you instead
i knew we'd be together for the rest of forever
when lizzy looked at me and said
hey baby
there's a world out there and i wanna be in it
i got a life and i'm gonna live it
don't tell me the sky's the limit
there's footprints on the moon
i wanna do my walkin' down the road less traveled
sew my dreams where they won't unravel
if you play it safe you won't get nowhere
i can't stay in here when there's a world out there
i imagine when they land on a brand new planet
in some far off galaxy
somebody in the rocket's gonna look out the window
feeling just like lizzy and me
there's a world out there and i wanna be in it
i got a life and i'm gonna live it
don't tell me the sky's the limit
there's footprints on the moon
i wanna do my walkin' down the road less traveled
sew my dreams where they won't unravel
if you play it safe you won't get nowhere
i can't stay in here when there's a world out there
if you play it safe you won't get nowhere
you can't stay in here when there's a world out there
"(no, i just can't do it)"
there's a world out there
(don't even try and play it safe)
"no, no, no"
(you're not gonna get anywhere)
iâ€™d spent a lot more time out in the pouring rain without an umbrella
covering my head
and iâ€™d stood up to that bully when he pushed and called me names
but i was too afraid
and iâ€™d gone on and saw elvis that night he came to town
mama said i couldn't
and i'd went skinny dipping with jenny carson that time she dared me to
but i didn't
"oh i, iâ€™d done a lot of things different"
i wish iâ€™d spent more time with my dad when he was alive
now i don't have the chance
and i wish i'd told my brother how much i loved him before he went off to war
but i just shook his hand
i wish iâ€™d gone to church on sunday morning when my grandma begged me to
but i was afraid of god
i wish i would of listened when they said boy you're gonna wish you hadn't
but i wouldn't
"oh i, iâ€™d done a lot of things different"
people say they wouldn't change a thing
even if they could
oh but i would
there was this red dress she wanted one time so bad she could taste it
"i shoulda bought it, but i didn't"
she wanted to paint our bedroom yellow and trim it in blues and greens
"but i wouldn't let her, it wouldn't of hurt nothing"
"she loved, to be held and kissed and touched"
"but i didn't do it, not nearly enough"
and if iâ€™d had known that dance was gonna be our last dance
"i'd asked that band to play on and on, on and on"
"oh i, iâ€™d done a lot of things different"
people say they wouldn't change a thing
even if they could
"oh but i would, ooh"
"oh i, iâ€™d done a lot of things different"
"oh i, iâ€™d done a lot of things"
it's almost summer you know and i can't wait to go
diggin' my toes in the sand
spendin' long summer days soakin' up some rays
to the sound of a reggae band
my baby looks so good but i knew she would
and i'm so glad she's mine
i'm gonna kiss her again while the waves roll in
it's just a wonderful waste of time
"oooh, put all our cares behind us"
wrapped in each others arms is where you'll find us
kickin' back on a beach with my lover in reach
holdin' her hand in mine
crazy things that we do may not matter to you
it's just a wonderful waste of time
"ooooh, we're dancin' a hole to china"
even though we're on a beach in carolina
"ooooh, moonlight walks by the ocean"
"ooooh, there's no need to control our emotions"
i wanna tell you my friend i'd like to do it again
there's no reason or rhyme
"spendin' time on the shore, i'd like to do it some more"
it's just a wonderful waste of time
"yes, it's just a wonderful waste of time, just a wonderful waste of time"
"a wonderful waste of time, it's a wonderful waste of time"
"a wonderful waste of time, a wonderful waste of time"
"a wonderful waste of time, a wonderful waste of time"
"the time has come,"
you're really leavin you always told me that
you wanted to
i guess i never thought
it would happen
i guess i never really wanted it to
the world is calling you and
you must answer
but you can take me with you
in you drams
if you ever get back to amarillo
in a shiny new car or
worn out shoes
if you ever get back to amarillo
i be waitin for you
your sister told me you were workin at some office out in tinsel town
don forget about those who
love you
they're be there for you if you
get down
i believe in you and all youæš®e after
i hope you end up where you
want to be
thirty years now have
gone by quickly
i still think of you from time to time
"my wife died early, iæš³e got children"
iæš¦ happy and my health is fine
i often wondered if you found your
freedom
i sometimes wonder if i should
have gone
"i'm watching the clock, it says five to five"
the minutes are ticking so slow
"i'm ready to stop, gonna close up the shop"
so honey if you're ready lets go
take out your pinstripe suit
and your fancy cowboy boots
now ain't it a crime when you're lookin' so fine
"and tonight you're mine, all mine"
"packin' it up, movin' on out"
headed up to the big town
sure like them big city lights on a saturday night
coming in from the country
"packin it up, movin' on out"
headed up to the big town
sure like those big city lights on a saturday night
coming in from the country
take off my blue jeans
slip on the hottest dress that you've ever seen
just like an ad in a fashion magazine
"it's you and me babe, a sight for sore eyes to see"
take in a movie or maybe a show
dance all night just letting it go
champagne and roses waiting back at our suite
so kick off your boots and make sweet love to me
in the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight
any place is all right long as i'm with you
in a faraway land on the trophic sea sand
if your hand's in my hand i won't be blue
way up on the mountain a way down in the valley
i know i'll be happy anyplace anywhere i don't care
in the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight
any place is all right long as you are there
i could be happy in one little room with only a table and a chair
as happy as i'd be in a kingdom by the sea darling if you were there
i could be rich or i could be poor in fact if you were by my side
i could be anything in the whole wide world and i know i'll be satisfied
way up on the mountain...
now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
but give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
for i found her when the snow on the ground
i traced her little footprints in the snow
i found her little footprints in the snow
i bless that happy day when nellie lost her way
for i found her when the snow was on the ground
i dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
i found her little footprints and i traced them in the snow
i found her when the snow was on the ground
now she's up in heaven she's with the angel band
i know i'm going to meet her in that promised land
but every time the snow falls it brings back memories
for i found her when the snow was on the ground
diggy liggy li and diggy liggy lo
they fell in love at the fais-do-do
the pop was cold and the coffee *chaud
for diggy liggy li and diggy liggy lo

lovin' you is spiritual
you lovin' me is a miracle
it's anything but typical
especially for a guy like me
"and naw, it ain't 'cause i'm livin' right"
it ain't 'cause i got it all figured out
but i swear that i see the light
every time you cut the lights out
it ain't hard to get to heaven when you got an angel
layin' in bed right by your side
when i got my fingers runnin' through your halo
"girl, i swear it kills me every time"
when you kiss me how you kiss me
touch me how you touch me
love me how you love me to paradise
it ain't hard to get to heaven (hard to get to heavеn)
it ain't hard to get to heaven
"hеll, i go there every night"
i don't need a stairway
just a little dance down the hallway
at the end of every day
"baby, it's as easy as that"
it ain't hard to get to heaven when you got an angel
layin' in bed right by your side (bed right by your side)
when i got my fingers runnin' through your halo
"girl, i swear it kills me every time (it kills me every time)"
when you kiss me how you kiss me
touch me how you touch me
love me how you love me to paradise
it ain't hard to get to heaven (hard to get to heaven)
it ain't hard to get to heaven
"hell, i go there every night"
"yeah, baby"
(it ain't hard to get to heaven)
"hell, i go there every night"

if i could be anywhere with anyone
you know exactly where i?d be
under the covers waitin? for the sun to rise
your head on the pillow next to me
your feet propped up on that kitchen chair
mornin? papers scattered all around you
coffee brewin? on that cast-iron stove
and the pleasure of just knowin? that you?re mine
well i love the way you look
love the way you feel
and the way you roll your eyes at the kisses that i steal
love the way you stare
when you?re starin? right at me
"i just love your company, oh yes i do"
arm-in-arm on some spring sidewalk day
laughin? just because it feels so right
wrapped up under the blankets all cozy by the fire
as long as you?re here close enough to touch
well i love the way you look
love the way you feel
and the way you roll your eyes at the kisses that i steal
love the way you stare
when you?re starin? right at me
"and i just love your company, oh yes i do"
(solo)
well i love the way you look
love the way you smell
and i love your pretty eyes and the lies they never tell
love the way you stare
when you?re starin? right at me
and i just love your company

i went through the closet back in my old home
found a letterman's jacket so i slipped it on
deep in the pocket still folded up tight
was the letter you wrote to tell me goodbye
the minute i saw it i just had to smile
it smelled like old leather as smooth as a child
i took a deep breath then put it away
there was no need to read it i knew just what it would say
"i know the words by heart, i know every line"
from this ain't easy to you'll get along just fine
"i know every comma, every question mark"
no i don't have to look i know the words by heart
seems like home movies flash through my head
"the homecoming game, that night on my bed"
the words that you wrote still cut me in two
how you said you still cared but that we were through
"i know the words by heart, i know every line"
from this ain't easy to you'll get along just fine
"i know every comma, every question mark"
no i don't have to look i know the words by heart
ain't it funny how a memory can play tricks on your mind
i don't remember a thing from my classes but i can quote you every line
i took off my jacket and put it away
with your note in the pocket like i found it that day
poured me a beer then pictured your face
and drank a silent toast to things that time can't erase
"i know the words by heart, i know every line"
from this ain't easy to you'll get along just fine
"i know every comma, every question mark"
no i don't have to look i know the words by heart
"i know the words by heart, i know every line"
from this ain't easy to you'll get along just fine
"i know every comma, every question mark"
no i don't have to look i know the words by heart
i know the words
i’d give anything to go back
do anything to go there
to take my breath away again
i still see your face right there
staring at me and i swear
i can feel you here
when i close my eyes
i know i should drop everything
and run straight back to your side
maybe i should take a bus ride
maybe i should put this car in drive
and go find the love that we both used to know
maybe i can find the one way
maybe you’ll forgive me someday
no red lights stopping me
nothing gonna slow me down
starting now
"every step, every turn that i take"
"every thought, every move that i make"
brings me closer to you
if the day is done and i haven’t found you
i’ll take my love and turn around
go down another road and try again
"yea, try again"
maybe i should take a bus ride
maybe i should put this car in drive
and go find the love that we both used to know
maybe i can find the one way
maybe you’ll forgive me someday
no red lights stopping me
nothing gonna slow me down
starting now
i’m gonna find a new way to love you
i’m gonna find the one way to hold you
cuz i just can’t stay
sitting around
waitin on love to come back around
back around
maybe i should take a bus ride
maybe i should put this car in drive
and go find the love that we both used to know
maybe i can find the one way
maybe you’ll forgive me someday
no red lights stopping me
nothing gonna slow me down
"yea, no red lights stopping me"
never gonna slow me down
starting now
"yea, starting now"
i’m headin for ya baby
starting now
i’m gonna find ya baby
startin now

south of the border
down mexico way
that's where i fell in love
when stars above came out to play
for it was fiesta
and we were so gay
south of the border
down mexico way
she was a picture
in old spanish lace
and for a tender while
i kissed the smile upon her face
for it was fiesta
and we were so gay
south of the border
down mexico way
south of the border
i rode back one day
there in a veil of white
by candlelight she knelt to pray
the mission bells told me
that i mustn't stay
south of the border
down mexico way
ay! ay! ay! ay!
ay! ay! ay! ay!
ay! ay! ay! ay!
ay! ay! ay! ay!
i was a highwayman. along the coach roads i did ride
with sword and pistol by my side
many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
the bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
but i am still alive.
i was a sailor. i was born upon the tide
and with the sea i did abide.
i sailed a schooner round the horn to mexico
i went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
and when the yards broke off they said that i got killed
but i am living still.
i was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
where steel and water did collide
a place called boulder on the wild colorado
i slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
they buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
but i am still around..i'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around
and when i reach the other side
i'll find a place to rest my spirit if i can
perhaps i may become a highwayman again
or i may simply be a single drop of rain
but i will remain
"and i'll be back again, and again and again and again and again.."
they say love is blind
i know that still rings true
cause i couldn't see it comin'
but when it landed i sure knew
well it knocked me to my knees
it hit me like a train
and i never will forget ole what's her name
i gotta long term loss of shor term memory
and one thing in my life is for ever changed
i'm sure i fell in love
with this angel from above
and i never will forget ole what's her name
oh what's her name???
time just keeps on ticken
and i've tried to move on
and though i keep on searchin'
i'm pretty sure she's gone
i know i'll always miss her
and things will never be the same
and i never will forget ole what's her name
i gotta long term loss of shor term memory
and one thing in my life is for ever changed
i'm sure i fell in love
with this angel from above
and i never will forget ole what's her name
oh what's her name?
she used to get her fix with just one little kiss or touch
?cause in her over the edge
"i keep her up, making love all night,"
had the stuff to make her feel alright
but now she won't go near that ledge.
"she don't get high anymore,"
"i don't make her fly like before,"
her heart is out there soaring someone else
"i'm not the song that she sings,"
i can't give her those wings
"hard as i try, i'm not the sky she's looking for"
she don't get high anymore.
i remember when she used to breathe me in
"back then, she couldn't get enough."
"we'd lay looking out at the clouds,"
i thought we never come down
she said my love was like some kind of drug.
"but she don't get high anymore,"
"i don't make her fly like before,"
her heart is out there soaring someone else
"i'm not the dream that she dreams,"
i can't give her those wings.
"hard as i try, i'm not the sky she's looking for,"
she don't get high anymore.
"oh, i'm not the song that she sings"
i can't give her those wings
"hard as i try, i'm not the sky she's looking for,"
she don't get high anymore
she don't get high anymore
she don't get high
anymore.
"she don't get high, she don't get high?"

"he called me baby, baby, all night long"
used to hold and kiss me until dawn
"then one day i woke, and he was gone"
"now there's no more baby, baby, all night long"
"he called me baby, baby, all night long"
kissed my tears away when things went wrong
"oh what i'd give, if he'd just come on back home"
"and call me baby, baby, all night long"
"he called me baby, baby, all night long"
"built me up so high, and made me strong"
"now each night, in dreams, just like a song"
"i still hear baby, baby"
"still hear baby, baby"
"still hear baby, baby, all night long"

our little girl taken sick one evening
as she walked home from school
and in her death bed soon bring her
it made us so sad and so blue
then she called me close to her bedside
"and whispered these words soft and low,"
"""tell mommy to come to me quickly,"
"i want to kiss you both then go"""
i hear a sweet voice calling
way up in heaven on high
"god has made room for you daughter,"
oh mommy and daddy don't cry
take care of my little brother
tell him i've gone to rest
i know his little heart is broken
he's all that you have left
then she closed her eyes forever
never to see us no more
until we meet our darling
on that bright and peaceful shore
i've been away for so long fought a war that's come and gone
doesn't anybody know my name
my sister upped and wed mom was sick and took to bed
and my old dog red's gone lame
please tell me if you can what time the trains roll in
(two ten six eighteen) ten forty four
this old house is falling down there ain't no need in me for hanging round
doesn't anybody know my name
the girl i left behind she's gone with this friend of mine
i don't have to see a sign to know things ain't the same
please tell me if you can...
you can't get far away on just a soldier's pay doesn't anybody know my name
used to be when i could see everybody wanted me
guess nobody cares to see a blind man catch a train
please tell me if you can...
well i slipped out of the house about sundown while mama was a washing her hair
and you can bet your bottom dollar she'll come a lookin' for me
when she finds that i'm not there
and if she catches her sweet thang a running around
i know there'll be the debit to pay
she'll come blowin' like a cyclone through that door
and i can hear exactly what she'll say
well has anybody here seen sweet thang i got a notion he'll be headed this-a way
cause when my sweet thang is out tomocattin' around
he finds a sandbox like this to play
i wanna tell all you barroom roses if my sweet thang does happen by
you'd better take my advice and if you blink more than twice
you'd better have something in your eyes
[ guitar ]
well i gave my baby money on payday except a little she don't know that i've got
cause there's a cute little waitress down at the corner cafe
and she seems to like me quite a lot
well we were sittin' in this back booth a havin' a talk
and she's believed in every word that i said
when the door blew open and mama walked in yellin' loud enough to wake the dead
well has anybody here seen sweet thang i got a notion he'll be headed this-a way
cause when my sweet thang is out tomocattin' around
he finds a sandbox like this to play
i wanna tell all you cafe cuties if my sweet thang should have a bite
you'd better take mom's advice if you'll blink more than twice
you'd better have something in your eyes
you take all mom's advice if you'll blink more than twice
you'd better have something in your eyes
when you are sad and lonely and have no place to go
"call me up, sweet baby, and bring along some dough"
"and we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'"
"honky tonkin', honey baby"
we'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.
when you and your baby have a fallin' out
just call me up sweet mama and we'll go steppin' out
"and we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'"
"honky tonkin', honey baby"
we'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.

you packed in the morning
i stared out the window
and i struggled for something to say
you left in the rain without closing the door
i didn't stand in your way
now i miss you more
than i missed you before
"and now where i'll find comfort, god knows"
'cause you left me
just when i needed you most
"yes, you left me"
just when i needed you most
now most every morning
i stare out the window
i think about where you might be
i've written you letters that i'd like to send
if you would just send one to me
'cause i need you more
than i needed before
"and now where i'll find comfort, god knows"
'cause you left me
just when i needed you most
"yes, you left me"
just when i needed you most
you packed in the morning
i stared out the window
and i struggled for something to say
you left in the rain without closing the door
i didn't stand in your way
now i love you more
than i loved you before
"and now where i'll find comfort, god knows"
'cause you left me
just when i needed you most
you left me
just when i needed you most
"oh, you left me"
just when i needed you most
i'm not asking you to make a lot of promises
or to say that you've been feeling like i am
i may be sure just though but what i like to know
is would you like to go somewhere with me sometime
we could sit around and talked the way we did that night
when i met you you were with that friend of mine
things may not go just right just like they did that night
so would you like to go somewhere with me sometime
you're with the same girl as the night i met you
did you tell her that i said i lose a friend
but since met you i just can't forget you
so it looks like this is where our friendship ends
we could sit around and talked the way we did that night
or do anything that we might have in mind
things may not go just right just like they did that night
so would you like to go somewhere with me sometime
[ guitar ]
you're with the same girl...
(just hang around my tears are overdue)
if you want to see somebody cry their heart out
for a love they lost and must live without
if you're not afraid my misery might rub off on you
just hang around my tears are overdue
if you want to hear confessions from a broken man
who once held a world of love right in his hands
if you wanna see a heartbreak right in two in front of you
just hang around my tears are overdue
now there's not a way that i can say how much it really hurts
when a broken heart and guilty conscience starts to work
i hope you won't forget the sight you see today
just remember love i had then threw away
if you're not afraid my misery might rub off on you
just hang around my tears are overdue just hang around my tears are overdue

all my friens are asking me where i plan to spend the holidays
people seem to celebrate the season in so many different ways
some go where the weather's freezing cold while others like it warm
i don't care about the weather just whether i spend christmas in your arms
"we could drive up to the mountains, build a fire and watch it snow"
we could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow
"i'd be happy in the city, i'd be happy on the farm"
i don't care whre i spend christmas as long as i spend christmas in your arms
it was only last december i had no christmas spirir in my heart
my world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart
"but now you're here beside me, no greater gift is wrapped beneath my tree"
and the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me
i don't care where i spend christmas as long as i spend christmas in your arms
i'm gonna take you for a date
take you for a ride
gonna get you over there on the passenger's side

"girl, i'm digging on it, on you tonight"
"ain't it immediate, it's open now"
wishing a woman
it's the damn right

yesterday i thought that i was low as i could get
i had hit rock bottom ever since you up and left
but this morning when i saw you with
"somebody else, well needless to say"
that's when i started sinking even lower
and as far as where i am at today
there's two feet of topsoil
"a little bit of bedrock, limestone in between"
a fossilized dinosaur
a little patch of crude oil
a thousand feet of granite underneath
then there's me
i was kinda hopin' i could dig my way back out
a couple dozen roses maybe get you back somehow
but the love in your eyes as you talked to him
today was plain to see
"so i ain't gonna get involved, but"
should you change your mind
well you know right where i'll be
there's two feet of topsoil
"a little bit of bedrock, limestone in between"
a fossilized dinosaur
a little patch of crude oil
a thousand feet of granite underneath
then there's me
"well,there's two feet of topsoil"
"a little bit of bedrock, limestone in between"
a fossilized dinosaur
a little patch of crude oil
a thousand feet of granite underneath
"yeah, there's two feet of topsoil"
"a little bit of bedrock, limestone in between"
a fossilized dinosaur
a little patch of crude oil
a thousand feet of granite underneath
then there's me
i really got the feeling that i'll love you for a long long time
i felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign
i love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
i really got the feeling that i'll love you 'til my dying day
you're a gentle man
and a gentle man is getting mighty hard to find these days
and you're a tender man
and you're man enough to show your love and tender ways
i really got the feeling that i'll love you for a long long time
i felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign
i love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
i really got the feeling that i'll love you 'til my dying day
i love those silly things you do
you make me feel once more like an innocent child of two
i really got the feeling that i'll love you for a long long time
i felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign
i love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
i really got the feeling that i'll love you 'til my dying day
i really got the feeling got the feeling
i really got the feeling got the feeling
i really got the feeling that i'll love you 'til my dying day
you're no longer my broomstick cowboy riding the make believe trail
and all my girlish tricks they used to work somehow they now seem to fail
why couldn't time just slow up why do we have to grow up so soon
gone are the days of my broomstick cowboy roping your imaginary steers
it sseem just like only yesterday you brushed away my first tears
now you shy away from my touch as time change just that much so soon
straddlin' fences deep around corners playin'
bang bang shoot 'em up hidin' in the hay
time is a thief and a bad ol' meaner stealing all our games away
i thought you'd always be my broomstick cowboy you'd always be my very own
it's funny how time just seems to slip away you don't miss it till it's all gone
oh how tall you stay in you've grown into a man so soon
oh how tall you stay in you've grown into a man so soon
i spent last night in the arms
of a girl in louisiana
and though i'm out on the highway
my thoughts are still with her
such a strange combination of a woman and a child
such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles
callin' baton rouge
a replay of last night's events
roll through my mind
except a scene or two
erased by sweet red wine
and i see a truck stop sign ahead
so i change lanes
i need a cup of coffee
and a couple dollars change
callin' baton rouge
operator won't you put me on through
i gotta' send my love down to baton rouge
hurry up won't you put her on the line
i gotta' talk to the girl just one more time
"hello samantha dear, i hope you're feelin' fine"
and it won't be long until i'm with you all the time
but until then i'll spend my money up right down to my last dime
callin' baton rouge
operator won't you put me on through
i gotta' send my love down to baton rouge
hurry up won't you put her on the line
i gotta' talk to the girl just one more time
callin' baton rouge
"sweet baton rouge, my baton rouge"
(gene nelson/doug swander)
"something's missing, something's wrong"
something's not right where it belongs
why am i doubting what i thought i knew
what's come over you
where's the laughter where's that touch
that made me feel you were in love
i pray it's just a phase you're going through
what's come over you
"i can roll with the tide, come in from the rain"
"turn my back to the wind, stand my share of pain"
but if you don't love me there's nothing i can do
what's come over you
all these memories of all those times
make it so hard to say goodbye
to all those dreams we shared that won't come true
what's come over you
"i can roll with the tide, come in from the rain"
"turn my back to the wind, stand my share of pain"
but if you don't love me there's nothing i can do
where would you be
i wonder where your heart is
'cause it sure don't feel like it's here
sometimes i think you wish
that i would just disappear
have i got it all wrong
have you felt this way long
are you already gone
do you feel lonely
when you're here by my side
does the sound of freedom
echo in your mind
do you wish you were by yourself
or that i was someone else
anyone else
where would you be
if you weren't here with me
where would you go
if you were single and free
who would you love
would it be me
where would you be
i don't wanna hold you back
no i don't wanna slow you down
i don't wanna make you feel
like you are tied up and bound
'cause that's not what love's about
if there's no chance we can work it out
tell me now
"oh, tell tell me now"
have i become the enemy
is it hard to be yourself
in my company
where would you be
where would you go
who would you love

we found it
duet by dolly parton and porter wagoner
writer porter wagoner
copyright 1972
we've been a searchin' for the love that lost its feeling
that one time filled our hearts with fire with love revealing
we thought that love had gone never more to be returning
and the fire that we thought had gone out again is brightly burning
oh we found it oh we found it yes we found it yeah we found it
joy to love joy to love we found it
and the lights are way down low the fire of love is high
we found it yes we found it oh we found it oh we found it
sweet love you and i
well i never seen a lovelight shine so bright no wonder we found it
shining like a neon light with love all around it
it's nights like this with love's sweet bliss sprinkled all around it
we cried a while but now we smiled hmm hmm we found it
oh we found it...
oh we found it...
(spoken:)
i love the way you stand in my way
you won't move 'til you get a kiss
and how you tell me that my name
it tastes so sweet on your lips
i love the way you hold me with your eyes
hold me so tight that i can't move
it's like everything i've ever known is a lie
and you're the simple truth
is it a dream or is it real?
"all i know is you make me feel so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
you make me feel so beautiful (feel like i could fly)
beautiful (cross the clear blue sky)
beautiful (baby i could cry)
you make me feel so beautiful
(spoken:)
i love how soft you touch my skin
like you're touching the wings of a butterfly
i wish we could just lock ourselves away in a room
where there was no such thing as time
i've never let anyone get this close
i've always been afraid
but you break down every wall and i feel so safe
every part of who i am
is so in love cause what i have is beautiful
"beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
you make me feel so beautiful (feel like i could fly)
beautiful (cross the clear blue sky)
beautiful (baby i could cry)
you make me feel so beautiful
beautiful...
you make me feel so beautiful (when you touch my face)
beautiful (when you say my name)
beautiful (always find the way)
you make me feel so
beautiful
this is the song that nobody knows
i couldn't begin to describe how it goes
but it makes me cry or laugh right out loud
it's the song that i sing when there's no one around
this is the man that nobody sees
he wears my old clothes and he looks just like me
just one of the boys who gets lost in the crowd
he's the man that i am when there's no one around
"it's four in the morning, i'm lying in bed"
a tape of my failures playing inside my head
it's heartaches and hard knocks and things i don't know
i listen and i wonder where will it go
this is a glimpse of a child that's within'
he's so immature but he's still my best friend
"if he could learn how to fly, he'd never touch down"
he's the kid that i am when there's no one around
this is a dance i do every day
i let my feet go and get carried away
i let my soul lead and follow the sound
it's a dance that i do when there's no one around
"it's still four in the morning, i'm lying in bed"
a tape of my failures playing inside my head
it's heartaches and hard knocks and things i don't know
i listen and i wonder where will it go
this is the song that nobody knows
i still can't begin to describe how it goes
but it makes me cry or laugh right out loud
has it been ten years
"since we said ""i do"""
i've always heard marriage made one seem like two
but you're looking better than you did back then
you still make this old heart give in
and if i had it to do all over
i'd do it all over again
if tomorrow i found one more chance to begin
i'd love you all over again
"the preacher man said ""til death do us part"""
that seemed like forever to a young man's heart
now the days seem much shorter
the longer we love
and the memories just keep adding up
if tomorrow i found one more chance to begin
i'd love you all over again
(bob dipiero/tom shapiro)
there's a dealer with a car
he can sell you for a song
there's a psychic on the air
got a hot line to your palm
there's another politician who's makin' news
with a brand new twist on his version of the truth
they got powders they got pills with an x factor in it
supposed to make you look
ten years younger in a minute
"they try to sell you dreams, well i ain't buyin' what they sell"
but baby when you tell me there could be nobody else
"i believe you, i just look in your eyes"
"i believe you, a true heart never lies"
"it's more that just a feeling, it's a matter of faith"
when you tell me our forever won't fade away
"i believe you, i believe you"
yes i do
there are golden guarantees right above the dotted line
"promises to keep, all you gotta do is sign"
"that's just paper-thin trust, but i can tell you this"
when you tell me that you love me
and then seal it with a kiss
"i believe you, i just look in your eyes"
"i believe you, a true heart never lies"
"it's more that just a feeling, it's a matter of faith"
when you tell me our forever won't fade away
"i believe you, i believe you"
yes i do
"i believe you, i just look in your eyes"
"i believe you, a true heart never lies"
"it's more that just a feeling, it's a matter of faith"
when you tell me our forever won't fade away
"i believe you, i believe you"
"i know we just met, and here we are all alone"
i'm burning up with a feeling that i've never known
"true love takes time, and i'm not the kind"
that believes in love at first sight
"but, i've got a feeling that i'm close to believing tonight."
"we're so close, i'm almost in love"
so close to something i've been dreaming of
we're right on the verge of making love
"something much more than words, feels so right"
"i've never been so close, to love in my life."
no one has ever touched me the way that you do
"honey, don't tell me to stop, i'm begging of you"
"my hearts open wide, come on inside"
that's where i want you to stay
"cause i've got a feeling, my heart is to go walk away."
"we're so close, i'm almost in love"
so close to something i've been dreaming of
we're right on the verge of making love
"something much more than words, feels so right"
"i've never been so close, to love in my life."
"no, i've never been so close to love in my life"
all he could think about was i'm too young for this.
got my whole life ahead.
hell i'm just a kid myself.
how'm i gonna raise one.
all he could see were his dreams goin' up in smoke.
so much for ditchin' this town and hangin' out on the coast.
"oh well, those plans are long gone."
"and he said,"
there goes my life.
"there goes my future, my everything."
might as well kiss it all good-bye.
there goes my life.......
a couple years of up all night and a few thousand diapers later.
that mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator.
oh yeah..........he loves that little girl.
"momma's waiting to tuck her in,"
as she fumbles up those stairs.
she smiles back at him dragging that teddy bear.
"sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncin' curls."
he smiles.....
there goes my life.
"there goes my future, my everything."
"i love you, daddy good-night."
there goes my life.
she had that honda loaded down.
with abercrombie clothes and 15 pairs of shoes and his american express.
"he checked the oil and slammed the hood, said your good to go."
she hugged them both and headed off to the west coast.
"and he cried,"
there goes my life.
"there goes my future, my everything."
i love you.
baby good-bye.
there goes my life.
there goes my life.
baby good-bye.
"teddy gentry/s. alan taylor/john jarrard/greg fowler, 3:14"
if i could design forever
i'd put you and me together each night
together each night
the best i can do is promise
i'll love you true and honest and right
i'll love you right
starting tonight and from now on
i will be yours and yours alone
dependable and strong
a rock by your side
i'll be beside you through the stom
you'll have a fire to keep you warm
not just for now but from now on
starting tonight
ifa man ever loved a woman
then surely this is the moment for me
the moment for me
i've never known a feeling
so deep so real as being with you
as being with you

two dollars shy of a five dollar bill
last mile i pushed my truck uphill
about hurt me
i left my truck by the pump right where i parked it
walked through the doors of the last chance market
"have mercy, i was thirsty"
the guy behind the counter said what's it gonna be
"i said i don't know man, you tell me"
"it's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack"
"one goes in my tank, one comes in a sack"
makes life complicated when it costs the same
"hell it ain't no fun, to do without one"
but i'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
it's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what i mean
it's either beer of gasoline
i could feel that video camera watch me
checkin' out the sale on the ol' milwaukee
(mmm) three bucks to my name
that cooler had every brand known to man
"tall boys, bottles, and aluminum cans"
(aww) what a shame
and it's gettin' pretty bad when you finally discover
it all comes down to either one or the other
"it's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack"
"one goes in my tank, one comes in a sack"
makes life complicated when it costs the same
"hell it ain't no fun, to do without one"
but i'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
it's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what i mean
it's either beer of gasoline
i could see where this is headed
and i'm tired of talkin'
cold beer unleaded
hell i'm walkin'
"it's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack"
"one goes in my tank, one comes in a sack"
makes life complicated when it costs the same
"hell it ain't no fun, to do without one"
but i'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
it's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what i mean
it's either beer of gasoline
beer or gasoline
"it's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack"
"one goes in my tank, one comes in a sack"
now it ain't no fun to do without one
but i'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
i got sent home from school one day
with a shiner on my eye
fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why
when dad got home i told that story just like i'd rehearsed
then stood there on those tremblin' knees
and waited for the worst
"he said, ""let me tell you a secret about a father's love"
"a secret that my daddy said was just between us"""
"he said, ""daddies don't just love their children"
"every now and then, it's a love without end, amen"
"it's a love without end, amen"""
when i became a father in the spring of '81
there was no doubt that stubborn boy
was just like my father's son
and when i thought my patience
had been tested to the end
i took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him
"i said, ""let me tell you a secret about a father's love"
"a secret that my daddy said was just between us"""
"i said, ""daddies don't just love their children"
"every now and then it's a love without end, amen"
"it's a love without end, amen"""
last night i dreamed i died and stood outside those pearly gates
when suddenly i realized there must be some mistake
if they know half the things i've done
they'll never let me in
then somewhere from the other side i heard those words again
"they said, ""let me tell you a secret about a father's love"
a secret that my daddy said was just between us
"you see, daddies don't just love their children"
"every now and then it's a love without end, amen"
"it's a love without end, amen"""
i used to walk stooped
from the weight of my tears
but i just started laying my burdens down
i used to duck bullets from the rifle of fear
but i just started laying my burdens down
"oh, i'm laying them down"
i just started laying my burdens down
"oh, i'm laying them down"
i just started laying my burdens down
the flesh ain't nothing but the bark on a tree
i just started laying my burdens down
the tree isn't nothing but the soul in me
i just started laying my burdens down
"oh, i'm laying them down"
i just started laying my burdens down
"oh, i'm laying them down"
i just started laying my burdens down
my soul took love on a hell of a ride
i just started laying my burdens down
"my soul ain't nothing, but the car love drives"
i just started laying my burdens down
"oh, i'm laying them down"
i just started laying my burdens down
"oh, i'm laying them down"
i just started laying my burdens down
"love said, ""mama can i come on home? """
i just started laying my burdens down
"and god said, ""son you ain't never been gone"""
i just started laying my burdens down
"oh, i'm laying them down"
i just started laying my burdens down
"oh, i'm laying them down"
i just started laying my burdens down

if i cross your mind please let me cross it slowly
let me stop and reminisce with you for a while
and if i cross your mind please remember all the good things
think of me as happiness if i cross your mind
there must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind
and if there's one of me love among them that you find
please stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind
when you think of me love if i cross your mind
if you must hide my mem'ry when you're with someone else
then make mine very special when you're by yourself
but only in a memory can one turn back the time
to lovely tender moments that linger in my mind
there must be a million thoughts...
think of only good things if i cross your mind

"""twas battered and scared, and the auctioneer"
thought it scarcely worth his while
"to waste much time on the old violin,"
but he held it up with a smile.
"""what am i bidden, good folks,"" he cried,"
"""who'll start bidding for me?"
"a dollar, a dollar - now who""ll make it two _"
"two dollars, and who""ll make it three?"
"""three dollars once, three dollars twice,"
"going for three"". . but no!"
from the room far back a gray-haired man
came forward and picked up the bow;
"then wiping the dust from the old violin,"
"and tightening up the strings,"
"he played a melody,pure and sweet,"
as sweet as an angel sings.
the music ceased and the auctioneer
"with a voice that was quiet and low,"
"said: ""what am i bidden for the old violin?"""
and he held it up with the bow;
"""a thousand dollars - and who'll make it two?"
two thousand - and who'll make it three?
"three thousand once, three thousand twice"
"and going - and gone,"" said he."
"the people cheered, but some of them cried,"
"""we do not quite understand -"
"what changed its worth?"" the man replied:"
"""the touch of the masters hand."""
"and many a man with life out of tune,"
"and battered and torn with sin,"
is auctioned cheap to a thoughtless crowd.
much like the old violin.
"a ""mess of pottage,"" a glass of wine,"
"a game and he travels on,"
"he's going once, and going twice -"
he's going - and almost gone!
"but the master comes, and the foolish crowd,"
"never can quite understand,"
"the worth of a soul, and the change that's wrought"
by the touch of the master's hand.

"used to stay for hours, and listen to the rain."
"you'd hold me on the porch swing, while our troubles washed away."
"and daddy'd come and get me, girl it's time to come inside."
"and i'd say, just a few more minutes, daddy please, we need a little time."
to say our last good-byes.
"time flew by so quickly, and our love slowly died."
"we both knew that we had grown apart, neither one knew why..."
"told me you'd come back when, you'd made up your mind."
"now all those memories faded, all except the night..."
you said your last good-bye....
"i know you needed time to find yourself,"
but i can't keep my heart upon that shelf.
"boy it's been awhile now, since i heard your voice."
"i didn't want to call you, but my heart left me no choice...."
"i just called to tell you, that i'm really doing fine.."
"that i been doing lots of thinkin', and i finally decided it was time."
to say my last good-bye...
ohhhh....good-bye.......good-bye....
"i still feel 25,"
most of the time.
i still raise a little cain with the boys.
honky tonk and pretty woman.
lord i'm still right there with them.
singing above the crowd and the noise.
"sometimes i feel like jesse james,"
still trying to make a name.
knowing nothings gonna change what i am.
"i was a young troubadour,"
when i rode in on a song.
"and i'll be an old troubadour,"
when i'm gone.
"well, the truth about a mirror,"
it's that a damn old mirrow.
"don't really tell the whole truth,"
it don't show what's deep inside.
"oh read between the lines,"
it's really no reflection of my youth.
"i was a young troubadour,"
when i rode in on a song.
"and i'll be an old troubadour,"
when i'm gone.
"i'll be an old troubadour,"
when i'm gone
"oh, have you seen miss molly?"
her cheeks are rosy red
now when miss molly's smilin'
the sun is dim a spell
i'll trade my horse
and saddle cow
drivin' i'll resign
now listen dear miss molly
i've told you this before
her lips
are soft as satin
and they taste
like gingerbread
and when she laughs
her voice is like
a little silver bell
if only miss molly
will say that she'll be mine
and even tho' i told you so
i'll tell you just once more
"oh, oh, oh, me, oh"
my miss molly
i'm in love with you
"oh, me, oh, my miss molly"
won't you say you love me too
i'd like to stay with you for a while but i have promisses to keep
i could be happy here with you but i'm a so wild oat to reap
my strenght tells me my weakness shows you make me think of coats and ties
of babies home security and jobs that last from nine to five
i could conjure up the constant state of happiness
but i know that i am just another man
and in knowing that i know that i'll get more or less what i can get
so i'll do what i can
i have many steps to take reckless steps i cannot share
a mountain waits for me to climb and i must climb because it's there
i could conjure up...
but if you should not let me go and if you want me as i am
and for a while i'll be a god instead of just another man mhm
as i walk this land of broken dreams
i have visions of many things
but happiness is just an illusion
filled with sadness and confusion
what becomes of a brokenhearted
who had love that's now departed
i know i've got to find
"some kind of piece of mine, baby"
the roots of love grow all around
but for me they come tumble all down
"every day, heartaches grow a little stronger (just a little stronger)"
i can't stand this pain much longer
"i walk in shadows, searching for a life"
"cold and alone, no comfort inside"
hoping and praying for someone who cares
always moving and going nowhere
what becomes of a brokenhearted
who had love that's now departed
i know i've got to find
"some kind of piece of mine, help me"
i'm searching though i don't succeed
"for someone's love, there's a growing leaf"
oh is lost there's no place for beginning
all that's left is that unhappy ending
what becomes of a brokenhearted
who had love that's now departed
i know i've got to find
some kind of piece of mine
i'll be searching everywhere
just to find someone to care
i'll be looking every day
i know i'm gonna find a way
nothing's gonna stop me now
i will find a way somehow
(what becomes of a broken hearted)
honey put down that flyswatter
and pour me some ice water
and would you bring me my hammer
and could you find me some nails
for soon i'll be going
to work for this living
and with you here to guide me
then i cannot fail
the morning it stumbles
right in through the window
and this getting up early
gets old anyway
and if you listen close dear
the crying that you hear
is the nighttime lamenting
the start of the day
and it's hotter than concrete
in july in houston
and it'll get worse here
before it turns nice
but old tink's in the backyard
and i swear that boy's so smart
he's got everything ready
so we'll be all right
so honey put down that flyswatter
and pour me some ice water
and though i'll soon be going
well i haven't gone yet
so come stand here beside me
and hold my hand gently
and tell me do you remember
the first time we met
roll me up and smoke me when i die
"and if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye"
"i didn't come here, and i ain't leavin'"
so don't sit around and cry
just roll me up and smoke me when i die.
"now, you won't see no sad and teary eyes"
when i get my wings and it's my time to fly
call my friends and tell 'em
"there's a party, come on by"
now just roll me up and smoke me when i die.
roll me up and smoke me when i die
"and if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye"
"i didn't come here, and i ain't leavin'"
so don't sit around and cry
just roll me up and smoke me when i die.
when i'd go i've been here long enough
so you'll sing and tell more jokes and dance and stuff
"just keep the music playin',"
that'll be a good goodbye
roll me up and smoke me when i die.
roll me up and smoke me when i die
"and if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye"
"i didn't come here, and i ain't leavin'"
so don't sit around and cry
just roll me up and smoke me when i die.
"hey, take me out and build a roaring fire"
roll me in the flames for about an hour
then take me out and twist me up
and point me towards the sky
and roll me up and smoke me when i die.
roll me up and smoke me when i die
"and if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye"
"i didn't come here, and i ain't leavin'"
so don't sit around and cry
just roll me up and smoke me when i die.
just roll me up and smoke me when i die.
i think i go and see someone
and talk about what i´ve become
it's beginnig to get the best of me...
i never was a drinking man
but now i finally understand
how something can bring you to your knees
i'm addicted to two blue eyes
intoxicated by you every night
i can feel you running through my blood
i'm under the influence of love
it´s got a hold of me and it won´t let go
it's on the verge of being out of control
it´s got me climbing the walls and walking floor...
i can´t seem to get enough of you
it´s all i ever wanna do
and i keep craving you more and more
i'm addicted to two blue eyes
intoxicated by you every night
i can feel you running through my blood
i'm under the influence of love
baby what am i supposed to do?
i´ve become dependent on you...
i'm addicted to two blue eyes
intoxicated by you every night
i can feel you running through my blood
i'm under the influence of love
i'm under the influence of love
i'm under the influence of love
sometimes i smile when you stayied home for a while
what did you expect me to do
i always cry each time you told a lie
what did you expect me to do
chours:
"each time i forgave you, you were bolder"
and each time you hurt me my heart grew colder
"sure, i love you but i found someone new"
what did you expect me to do
chours:
"each time i forgave you, you were bolder"
eachyou hurt me my hear grew colder
"sure, i love you but i found someone new"
let's begin with the day i met her
how fast this good old boy's world got better
"sky got bluer, the grass got greener"
just the first few seconds after i first seen her
like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
my best old jeans and my broke in sneakers
a home run pitch floating right down the middle
the sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
she's
right on the money
she goes directly to my heart
and when it comes to loving me
"she's everything, i mean bulls eye perfect"
she's right on the money
she's no red lights when i've overslept
she's a three point jump shot that's nothing but net
"a hand full of aces, the dealer's done dealing"
"i'm forever on a roll, that's how she's got me feeling"
she's
right on the money
she goes direct to my heart
"and when it comes to loving me, she's everything, i mean bulls eye perfect"
she's
right on the money
she's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
"i ain't much around the house, but i aim to please"
there's absolutely no reason to doubt her
when she says i wouldn't last ten minutes without her
she's
right on the money
she goes directly to my heart
and when it comes to loving me
"she's everything, i mean bulls eye perfect"
she's
right on the money
i've had enough
of words and games
i don't think i know you
i can't forget your name
your eyes are clear
the way is strange
the light's in the hallway
if you forget your way
you were here to be only
what you wanted anyway
you were sad to be sorry
you were sorry everyday
you were here to be loved
but love's trickled away
from your eyes
i tell myself
i'm least of all to blame
for these words of my choosing
for my rules that make the game
but my eyes are clear
i can see the way is strange
through the dark of the hallway
that echoes back your name
i was here to be only
what i wanted anyway
i was sad to be sorry
i was sorry everyday
i was here to be loved
but love's trickled away
from my eyes
you kindle the fire of love inside me each time our lips meet
i'm not strong when we're alone your kisses make me weak
you must know how i feel but do you feel the same
every time you kiss me you add fuel to the flame
my eyes light up when i see you i burn with desire
each time you're near you say you care but still i'm not sure
please don't ask me to love you if you're not going to change my name
cause every time you touch me you add fuel to the flame
this fire of love you started inside of me has reached my very soul
you're adding fuel to a flame that's already out of control
when you give me your name i'll give you everything
yes everytime you kiss me you add fuel to the flame
"early this morning, he knocked on my door"
early this morning he knocked on my door
"i said ""hello, satan, i believe it's time to go"""
me and the devil are walkin' side by side
me and the devil are walkin' side by side
"well, i'm goin' to beat my man until i get satisfied"
he says i don't do him right
that i dog him around
"well, babe, you know you ain't treating me right"
he says i don't do him right
that i dog him around
"well, it must be this old evil spirit"
so deep down within the ground
you may bury my body down by the highway side
"...oh, babe i don't care what you do with my body"
you may bury my body down by the highway side
so my old evil spirit can catch a greyhound bus and ride
"early this morning, he knocked on my door"
now me and the devil are walking side by side
side by side
"mary, did you know"
that your baby boy will one day walk on water?
"mary, did you know"
that your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?
did you know
that your baby boy has come to make you new?
this child that you've delivered
will soon deliver you
"mary, did you know"
that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
"mary, did you know"
that your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?
did you know
that your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
and when you kiss your little baby
you've kissed the face of god
"mary, did you know"
"oh mary, did you know"
the blind will see
the deaf will hear
and the dead will live again
the lame will leap
the dumb will speak
the praises of the lamb
"oh mary, did you know"
that your baby boy is lord of all creation?
"mary, did you know"
that your baby boy would one day rule the nations?
did you know that your baby boy is heaven's perfect lamb?
the sleeping child you're holding is the great i am
"oh, mary did you know?"
"ooh, ooh mary did you know?"
mary did you know?
i've been talkin' to myself
"thinkin' bout changing my mind, i've been talkin' to myself"
thought i put your memory high upon a shelf
"well you know i said i could get you, you go away in town"
"but lately i've been thinking,"
and i'm thinkin' bout changing my mind
"change my mind, you hoo, hoo"
"change my mind, change my mind"
woho-hoo
"well i said i love you, and then i said goodbye"
"i know i made you haṗpy, and then i made you cry"
"if i promised you forever, then i told you a lie"
"but lately i've been thinkin',"
and i'm thinkin' 'bout changing my mind
"change my mind, you hoo, hoo"
"change my mind, change my mind"
woho-hoo

love that runs away from me
dreams that just won't let me be
blues that keep on botherin' me
chains that just won't set me free
too far away from you and all your charms
just out of reach of my two open arms
each night in dreams i see your face
memories time cannot erase
then i awake and find you gone
i'm so blue and all alone
so far away from lips so sweet and warm
just out of reach of my two empty arms
that lonesome feelin' all the time
knowing you cannot be mine
dreams that hurt me in my sleep
vows that we could never keep
too far away from lips so sweet and warm

cindy was a ragged angel just a poor girl on her street
cindy's eyes showed signs of hunger never had enough to eat
cindy was a ragged angel golden hair and eyes of blue
cindy loved her paper dolly that's the only love she knew
cindy never knew her daddy and her mommie was seldom home
except for cindy's paper dolly cindy was all alone
cindy slept with her paper dolly on a blanket on the floor
she would shiver as the wind blew through the crack beneath the door
one night she laid with her paper dolly cold and hungry on the floor
that night god came for the ragged angel
and now cindy won't ever be cold and hungry no not anymore ragged angel

try to find the reference
it makes no difference to me.
"draw your own conclusions,"
add to my confusion if you please.
the time for concessions
and midnight confessions is long gone.
i’ll sit here in the silence
and wait for all the violence to engulf me.
"i hate to take the easy way out, now people,"
but options are closing down fast.
more things are wrought by prayer
than this world dreams of.
"vengeance has been tasted,"
"hatred cultivated,"
its an old game.
"everyone gets fatter,"
"people choose what matters,"
there’s no shame.
"i hate to take the easy way out, now people,"
but options are closing down fast.
more things are wrought by prayer
than this world dreams of.
"simple as a folk tale,"
"deadly as a stairwell,"
it surrounds you.
stupid men and bastards
always bite their masters.
they will get you.

"and every smile just seems to say, we're having some happy holidays"
"twinklin' lights on christmas trees, kids up on santa's kneww"
"busy lines on telephones, sending a merry christmas home"
"bells ringing everywhere, season spirit in the air"
"up and down the avenue, holiday dreams comin' true"
"a choir singing songs of cheer, carols we all love to hear"

"postman bringin' christmas cards, reindeer out in the yard"
"frosty with his eyes of coal, present wrapped in pretty bows"
"sidewalks full of happy eyes, flakes fallin' from the sky"
boys and girls at the big parade to see st. nick up on his sleigh
"the scene is set, it's beautiful, sounds of peace, joy and love"
"from all of us we'd like to say, have yourself some happy holidays"
memories that linger in my heart memories that make my heart grow cold
but some day we'll live them all again and my blue moon again will turn to gold
your lips that used to thrill me so your kisses were meant for only me
in my dreams we'll live them all again but my golden moon is just a memory
when my blue moon turns to gold again and the rainbow turns the clouds away
when my blue moon turns to gold again you'll be back within my arms to stay

the castle we built of dreams together was the sweetest stories ever told
you know maybe we could live them all again dark blue moon again will turn to gold
when my blue moon turns to gold again...
i get up in the mornin'
i drink a cup of coffee
i look out of the window
i try to get a-started
i turn it all over
plough it all under
i plant 'em in the spring time
i pick 'em in the summer
i live in my own mind
ain't nothin' but a good time
"no rain, just the sunshine"
out here in my own mind
i live where i can breathe
ain't nothin' but a cool breeze
nobody that it won't please
out here where you can breathe
mandy and dary
they'll show back up any day
that's one thing you can count on
but sometimes they'll be long gone
i'd rather be huntin'
hooked on fishin'
i read it on the t-shirts
but if you don't believe it

cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold
they'd rather give you a song than diamonds or gold
lonestar belt buckles and old faded levis
and each night begins a new day
"if you don't understand him, and he don't die young"
he'll probably just ride away
"mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys"
don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
'cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
even with someone they love
cowboys like smoky old pool rooms and clear mountain mornings
little warm puppies and children and girls of the night
them that don't know him won't like him and them that do
sometimes won't know how to take him
"he ain't wrong, he's just different but his pride won't let him"
do things to make you think he's right
grandpa's down
by the two lane
in the blazing sun
or pouring rain
sells tomatoes
from the back
of his pickup truck
reads the bible line for line
while sipping on
some homeade wine
that's who he is
and what he does
he's just like us
my dad's got
a crippled hand
a casualty of vietnam
but he's still down
at the sawmill every day
oh and first thing
'fore the break of dawn
mama's got his eggs
and coffee on
my whole life
it's been that way
we come from
back in the hollers
we got sweat
on our blue collars
the living's hard
but the living's good
you see god sent
the heavens down
and hung 'em 'round
my neck of the woods
just as sure as the river flows
we take care of our own
step right up when someone needs a friend
last year on the johnson farm
a fire wiped out the house and barn
the whole town showed up
"to build 'em back again, all right"
we come from
back in the hollers
we got sweat
on our blue collars
the living's hard
but the living's good
you see god sent
the heavens down
and hung 'em 'round

i'm going to get me a momma
lord i ain't never seen
where was you momma when the train left the shed
where was you momma when the train left the shed
standin' in my front door wishin' to god i was dead
the mechanic raised up from under my hood
"he shook his head and said, ""this ain't good"
your timin' belt's done shrunk one size too small
those spark plug wires are a little too long
and your main prodsponder's nearly gone
"your injector ports are stripped and that ain't all"""
"""the torque converter's runnin' low on torque"
and that water pump's nearly down a quart
"but we caught it all in time so you're in luck"""
"he said, ""i've got the time and i've got the parts"
just give me the word and i'm ready to start
"i think we can bring her in for eight hundred bucks"""
"but don't be downhearted, i can fix it for you, sonny"
"it won't take too long, it'll just take money"
"then he said, ""ain't you that songwriter guy?"""
"i said, ""yes, i am,"" he said, ""so am i"""
and he sat down and played me a song by the grease rack
when he finished singin' he gave me a smile
and i closed my eyes and pondered awhile
"and he said, ""what do you think?"
"now don't hold nothin' back"""
"well, i gave him my most sorrowful look"
"and i said, ""this song's got a broken hook"
i can order you a new one from nashville but it won't be cheap
and i know you've been using a cut-rate thesaurus
"but don't be downhearted, i can fix it for you, sonny"
"it won't take too long, it'll just take money"
"and i said, ""hold on friend now i'm not through"
i hate to be the one to give you the news
but your whole melodic structure's worked itself loose
it's got so many dotted eighth notes in it
i'd keep her under fifty beats per minute
"i mean, that's just me talkin', it's really up to you"""
and you've got a bad safety problem with
that dominant chord with the augmented fifth
just see how dangerously high it raises you up
so just go on over there and work on my car
i'll sit here by the fan and chances are
"i can straighten this thing out for eig...nine hundred bucks"""
"but don't be downhearted, i can fix it for you, sonny"
it won't take too long
you guessed it
it may be a hit

oh the weather outside is frightful
but the fire is so delightful
and since we’ve no place to go
let it snow! let it snow! let it snow!
it doesn’t shows of stopping
and i’ve brought some corn for popping
the lights are turned way down low
let it snow! let it snow! let it snow!
when we finally kiss goodnight
how i’ll hate going out in the storm!
but if you’ll really hold me tight
all the way home i’ll be warm
the fire is slowly dying
"and, my dear, we’re still goodbying"
but as long as you love me so
let it snow! let it snow! let it snow!
"just a bunch of poor boys, daddy's girls"
children of the corn field
tryna turn a shift job into a dollar bill
we wear them muddy boots
stay true to how we're raised
ain't nothin' bout us fake
you know we're straight out of that dirty south
"dirty roads, nobody got no money"
got them shined up pickup trucks
whistlin' at them honies
"from the country, yes sir"
you know we're straight out of that long week work
"at night, everybody wanna party"
"all night long, bonfire on the back 40"
"in the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here"
"til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer"
just a bunch of john deere junkies
gettin' funky to some old hank
nothin' been stuck in the mud that we can't
hook up to a rusty chain in the summer or in the rain
"yeah, it's a kind of thing"
you know we're straight out of that dirty south
"dirty roads, nobody got no money"
got them shined up pickup trucks
whistlin' at them honies

sometimes late at night
when our friends are fast asleep
you say you'd like to take a stroll with me
"though we are wed to others, and it may not be right"
i have longed to hold you in my arms
sometimes late at night
i've cried myself to sleep
a thousand times or more
"but when i dream of you, my heart is light"
no matter what our friends may say
and it may not be right
"i love you so, you know i'll go"
sometimes late at night
i've cried myself to sleep
a thousand times or more
"but when i dream of you, my heart is light"
no matter what our friends may say
and it may not be right
"i love you so, you know i'll go"
sometimes late at night
when i fall in love it will be forever
or i'll never fall in love
in a restless world like this is
love is ended before it's begun
and too many moonlight kisses
seem to cool in the warmth of the sun.
when i give my heart it will be completely
or i'll never give my heart
and the moment i can feel that you feel that way too
is when i fall in love with you.
when i give my heart it will be completely
or i'll never i'll never give my heart
and the moment i can feel that you feel that way too
is when i fall in love with you...
(your cheatin' heart will make you weep)
your cheatin' heart will make you weep you'll cry and cry you'll try to sleep
but sleep won't come the whole night through your cheatin' heart will tell on you
when tears come down like falling rain you'll toss around and call my name
and you'll walk the floor the way i do your cheatin' heart will tell on you
your cheatin' heart will pine someday and you'll crave the love you threw away
the time will come when you'll be blue your cheatin' heart will tell on you
when tears come down...
this is the gospel according to me
a tale of whiskey turned to wine
ain't no moving of a mountainain't no parting of the sea
but i stand here witness to something just as divine
my miracle is five foot five
no doubt in my mind
she's the reason i'm alive
i wasn't always spiritual
oh but one thing's for sure
how could i not have faith in the god that created her?
my mama used to pray some day i'd see the light
never thought it'd be in someone's eyes
in a crowded restaurant on a friday night
"i heard angels sing, my whole life changed"
and i realized
my miracle was standing right there
looking so beautiful with blue jeans and long brown hair
i wasn't always spiritual
oh but one thing's for sure
how could i not have faith in the god that created her?
to see me now
it's crazy how
my life changed
but here i stand
a better man
and you can blame
my miracle
i wasn't always spiritual
oh but one thing's for sure
how could i not have faith in the god that created her?
yeah how could anybody not have faith
in the god that created her

every night itâ€™s the same
i hear you callinâ€™ my name
youâ€™re lyinâ€™ next to me
i give into your charms
you disappear in my arms
"i realize itâ€™s just a dream, but"
desperately i long to feel your touch
but you left me all alone in love
and now i
shake the sleep from my head
and try to crawl out of bed
today is just another day
i make the coffee for one
i turn the radio on
"pretend that everythingâ€™s ok, but"
desperately i long to feel your touch
but you left me all alone in love
and now i
know thereâ€™s no reason to smile
itâ€™s gonna take me awhile
â€˜cause i still love you desperately
desperately i long to feel your touch
but you left me all alone in love
and now i
watch the sun goinâ€™ down
there ainâ€™t nobody around
i feel a night in the breeze
i keep on tellinâ€™ myself
i donâ€™t need nobody else
"and i can do as i please, but"
desperately i long to feel your touch
but you left me all alone in love
and now i
desperately i long to feel your touch
but you left me all alone in love
and now
every night itâ€™s the same
i hear you callinâ€™ my name
i still love you desperately

"last saturday night i looked like a princess, dressed in calico"
now here come monday wash day and i look like a lady hobo
a rubbin' and a scrubbin'
and a rinsin' 'em out

i hope the sun comes out
"wash 'em out, bring 'em out, hang 'em on the line"
"git a little tired, just think about the good times"
wash day bluehooooooooooooos
well today i started loving you again
and i'm right back where i've really always been
i got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
then today i started loving you again
what a fool i was to think i could get by
with only these few million tears i've cried
well i should have known the worst was yet to come
and that crying time for me had just begun
cause today i started loving you again...
i know you don't mean to be mean to me
'cause when you want to
you can make me feel like we belong
we belong
lately you make me feel all i am is a back-up plan
i say i'm done and then you smile at me and i forget
everything i said
i buy into those eyes
and into your lies
"you say you'll call, but i know you"
"you say you're coming home, but i know you"
"you say you'll call, but i know you won't"
"you say you'll call, but i know you won't"
i wish you were where you're supposed to be
close to me
but here i am just staring at this candle burning out
still no sound
of footsteps on my stairs
or your voice anywhere
"you say you'll call, but i know you"
"you say you're coming home, but i know you"
"you say you've changed, but i know you won't"
i know you won't
"you say you'll call, but i know you"
"you say you're coming home, but i know you"
"you say you've changed, but i know you won't"
"you say you'll call, but i know you, you won't"
haven't you heard
haven't you heard
daddy's gone crazy
haven't you heard momma is gone
here i stand with my finger on his door bell
"my mind goes back to what i did last night,"
you see i finally talked his wife into leaving him
and i am just here to convince my conscious that its all alright
and i can see my old friend just sitting there staring at his little boy
"crying words are welded in my mind,"
haven't you heard
daddy's gone crazy
haven't you heard momma is gone
and either way i'm a loser
and i've been crying all night long
mr. haven't you heard
daddy's gone crazy
haven't you heard momma is gone
and either way i'm a loser
and i've been crying all night long
she bloomed for me in a little village
in a cabin on the hill
we made our vows to love each other
and i know we always will.
she's my rose of old kentucky
i watch her bloom as the years roll by
for me there'll never be another
i'll love her 'til the day i die.
in my dreams i see my darling
in a gingham dress she looks so sweet
how i long for old kentucky
for my darling i will meet.
well i know you often wonder
and i'll tell you the reason why
she's my rose of old kentucky
and i know that she will never lie
i been lonely much too long i'd give a yankee dime if you come back home
honey won't you let me hold you tight
tears keep a fallin' my eyes are blurred if i had the wings of a pretty little bird
i would fly right to your arms tonight
i'd jump the mississippi deep and wide if you was a waitin' on the other side
honey just to hug and hold you tight
i'd jump across and never get wet right there by your side i'd set
yes indeed everything would be alright
if you would come back home to me make me happy like i used to be
i'd start and meet you halfway
i'd leave here and never look back i'd run a mile in a minute flat
to get to you before the end of day
i'd jump the mississippi deep and wide...
i'd jump the mississippi deep and wide...
came in last night at half past ten
that baby of mine wouldn't let me in
so move it on over (move it on over)
move it on over (move it on over)
move over little dog cause the big dog's moving in
she's changed the lock on my front door
my door key don't fit no more
so get it on over (move it on over)
scoot it on over (move it on over)
move over skinny dog cause the fat dog's moving in
this dog house here is mighty small
but it's better than no house at all
so ease it on over (move it on over)
drag it on over (move it on over)
move over old dog cause a new dog's moving in
she told me not to play around
but i done let the deal go down
so pack it on over (move it on over)
tote it on over (move it on over)
move over nice dog cause a mad dog's moving in
"she warned me once, she warned me twice"
but i don't take no one's advice
so scratch it on over (move it on over)
shake it on over (move it on over)
move over short dog cause the tall dog's moving in
she'll crawl back to me on her knees
i'll be busy scratching fleas
so slide it on over (move it on over)
sneak it on over (move it on over)
move over good dog cause a mad dog's moving in
"remember pup, before you whine"
that side's yours and this side's mine
so shove it on over (move it on over)
sweep it on over (move it on over)
move over cold dog cause a hot dog's moving in
stop starin' at me
leave the sad looks at home
everybody feels bad
and you don't understand
it's not like i'm alone
'cause everyone has battles to fight
and i don't need your sympathy tonight
"yeah, it's a hard life"
but i'm okay
"if i didn't have this, i wouldn't be who i am today"
and i have lots of friends
"oh, and i have love"
"and yeah, i have a hard life but in some ways everybody does"
there's a lot i can't do
but don't be judgin me
i'm in a body i hate
"but i have my faith, more then what you see"
so what if i can't kick a soccer ball into a goal?
i feel like i can lift 500 pounds with my soul
"yeah, it's a hard life"
"oh, but i'm okay"
"if i didn't have this, i wouldn't be who i am today"
and i have lots of friends
"oh, and i have love"
"yeah, i have a hard life but in some ways everybody does"
and some like me have lost their battle
but they will be the sun that gives you warmth
and lights the way so we can shine on
"yeah, it's a hard life"
but i'm okay
"if i didn't have this, i wouldn't be who i am today"
and i have lots of friends
"oh, and i have love"
"yeah, i have a hard life but in some ways everybody does"
"yeah, i have a hard life but in some ways everybody does"
how many lovers in lifetimes've gone like clothing that we wear
long after it's worn out with love undying love undying love
life had no meaning till i gave you mine
now the red rose and green briar have entwined
with love undying love undying love
[ ac.guitar - steel ]
the light in the window is keeping us warm
and inside my heart is a raging storm of love
undying love undying love undying love
"sometimes i wonder why i spend,"
the lonely night dreaming of a song.
"the melody haunts my memory,"
"and i am, once again, with you,"
"when our love was new,"
and each kiss an inspiration.
"but that was long ago, and now my consolation,"
is in the star dust of a song.
"beside the garden wall when stars are bright,"
you are in arms.
"the nightingale tells his fairy tales,"
of paradise where roses grow.
"an' though i dream in vain,"
"in my heart there always will remain,"
my stardust melody:
the memory of love's refrain.
instrumental interlude.
"an' though i dream in vain,"
"in my heart there always will remain,"
my stardust melody:
the memory of love's refrain.
instrumental interlude.
"an' though i dream in vain,"
"in my heart there always will remain,"
my stardust melody:
the memory of love's refrain.
to the people up in texas it's the nearest thing to heaven here on earth
the lifestyle up in texas is just go on out and live for all it's worth
where the men are all men and the ladies there are born with ways to please
and the people up in texas think that the rest of all the world is over seas
you don't need no one to tell you when you cross that texas line
the air starts smellin' sweeter and the water tastes like wine
the sun is always shining so it's seldom ever cold people just grow up there never old
[ guitar ]
you don't need no one...
the people up in texas...
yeah the people up in texas think that the rest of all the world is over seas
it was back i remember in '33 when the great jimmie rodgers inspired me
to start movin' on start rollin' on
said they can't do you wrong if you don't stay too long so keep a movin' on
you know the famous jimmie well he's dead and gone
and my friend hank williams he sung his song
but they both moved on yes they're done long gone
but this old country train is still throwin' it's flames still a movin' on
[ piano ]
ah doggies keep that ole piano movin' on
from the country fairs to the honky tonks
i played my ole guitar and i sung my songs
i kept them movin' on didn't stay too long
just stay long enough so i can sing of my stuff and keep a movin' on
now that outlaw music's got a real good beat
and the new country pop i gotta say it's sweet
keeps you movin on i ain't a sayin it's wrong
but when it's all disappeared you're gonna find me right here still a movin' on
on the top of the charts i used to ride with the wind
to the number one spot i'm gonna make it again
i keep a movin' on keep a singin' my song
through the blues and the soul through the rock and the roll i'll keep a movin' on
[ guitar ]
yeah talk to me guitar tell 'em about me
well i see my old buddies and they're just sittin' there
rockin' away in that old rockin' chair
while i'm a movin' on just rollin' on
they've shifted too low but i'm still on the go and still a movin' on
so let the big wheels roll and let that rattler shake
this ole singing ranger ain't intending to break
i'm still a movin on still a singin' my song
and my old gravey train is still throwin' its flames still a movin' on
[ guitar - fiddle ]
"you ask me not to wear cologne,"
she'll know you've been with me alone.
and you can't take our secret home
so you ask me not to wear cologne.
"you can wipe the makeup off,"
the lipstick or a little gloss;
but fragrance lingers on
and on so you ask me not to wear cologne.
you leave my bed and go to hers leaving me alone and hurt.
i love you whether right or wrong
and you ask me not to wear cologne.
"i'm not out to hurt someone,"
"not you, not her, not anyone."
"but i've got heartaches of my own, why,"
"i can't even wear cologne. oh,"
"but i never meant for this to be,"
it wasn't in my heart to cheat.
love has a nature all its own
so i willingly gave up cologne.
"oh, and every time you come to me,"
i realize i'm in too deep.
i know you love us both
and i keep holdin' on you ask me not to wear cologne;
you say don't wear cologne.
"oh, whatever am i gonna do 'cause i am so in love with you."
"i know you love us both, but where do i belong?"
you ask me not to wear cologne?
"you ask me not to wear cologne,"
she'll know you've been with me alone.
and you can't take our secret home
so you ask me not to wear cologne.
"oh, how do i walk away from the greatest love i've known?"
you ask me not to wear cologne.
"oh, you ask me not to wear cologne."
you ask me not to wear cologne.
she'll know you've been with me alone
and i'm a scent you can't take home.
but will i ever get to wear cologne?
i burn with desire each time my heart fans the fire
to that old flame that burns inside of me
"she cried when i left her, now i try to forget her"
oh how foolish i was to ever wanna leave
because nobody in his right mind would've left her
i had to be crazy to say good bye
nobody in his right mind could've left her
even my heart was smart enough to stay behind
i still carry her picture
i wish her well with the new love i know she's found by now
"each night finds me dreamin', each day i spend thinkin'"
how much i wish she was still around
"she loves the music, tells the tales of her heart"
and she listens closely to the beats and the parts
she likes the songs that make her cry
and ones that pick her up and make her high.
"she likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it ,"
she's got the country in her ipod on her pocket.
"she loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle,"
she even likes the ones where
they're just talking rhyme and riddles.
"and she sings along when she's driving home going all alone,"
her life's a song.
"and she likes the songs that take her back and make her want,"
sometimes she just wants to dance and move on
she taps her feet and sheds a tear
plays air guitar and raises a beer.
"she likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it ,"
she's got the country in her ipod on her pocket.
"she loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle,"
she even likes the ones where
they're just talking rhyme and riddles.
"and she sings along when she's driving home going all alone,"
her life's a song.
at times she sings i know just how she feels
a broken heart on a love song that kills.
"she likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it ,"
she's got the country on her ipod in her pocket.
"she loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle,"
she even likes the ones where
they're just talking rhyme and riddles.
"and she sings along when she's driving home going all alone,"
her life's a song.
"she likes the hip-hop, she loves to rock it ,"
she's got the country on her ipod in her pocket.
"she loves the guitar, she likes the fiddle,"
she even likes the ones where
they're just talking rhyme and riddles.
"and she sings along when she's driving home going all alone,"
her life's a song.
"yeah, her life's a song."

full bill monroe lyrics...
and now the end is near and so i face the final curtain
my friend i'll say it clear i'll state my case of which i'm certain
i've lived a life that's full i traveled each and every highway
and more much more than this i did it my way
regrets i've had a few but then again too few to mention
i did what i had to do and saw it through without exemption
i planned each chartered course each careful step along the byway
and more much more than this i did it my way
yes there were times i'm sure you knew when i bit off more than i could chew
but through it all when there was doubt i ate it up and spit it out
i faced it all and i stood tall and did it my way
i've lived i've laughed and cried i've had my fill my share of losing
and now as tears subside i find it all so amusing
to think i did all that and may i say not in a shy way
oh no oh no not me i did it my way
for what is a man what has he got if not himself then he has not
to say the things he truly feels and not the worlds of one who kneels
the record shows i took the blows and did it my way yes it was my way

(as released by patsy cline 12/15/58)
i go to church on a sunday
the vows that i make
i break them on monday
the rest of the week
i do as i please
then come sunday morning
i pray on my knees
dear god
i know i'm not worthy
but i need you so
please won't you hurry
and help me turn back from
the path i have trod
you'll never be sorry
dear god
each day we read in the paper
of the carryin's on
of some of our neighbors
"we're sinnin', and lyin',"
and forgetting the faith
then we have the nerve
to ask is it to late
i used to sit for hours as a kid
seeing myself in the water below
shatter my image with the rocks i'd throw
shatter my image with the rocks i'd throw
long time gone and a long time ago
when i shattered my image with the rocks i'd throw
the world is cruel and people are cold
now they shatter my image with the rocks they throw
shatter my image with the rocks they throw
i'm far from perfect but i ain't all bad
and it hurts me more than it makes me mad
we all do things that we don't want told
and we all throw stones that we shouldn't throw
you shatter my image with the rocks you throw
long time gone and a long time ago
when i shattered my image with the rocks i'd throw
the world is cruel and people are cold
now they shatter my image with the rocks they throw
shatter my image with the rocks they throw
if you live in a glass house don't throw stones
don't shatter my image 'til you look at your own
look at your reflection in your house of glass
don't open my closet if your own's full of trash
stay out of my closet if your own's full of trash
long time gone and a long time ago
when i shattered my image with the rocks i'd throw
the world is cruel and people are cold
now they shatter my image with the rocks they throw
shatter my image with the rocks they throw
shatter my image with the rocks you throw
don't shatter my image with the rocks you throw
don't wanna hear that stuipd melody
the one we used to always keep playing on repeat
'cause it just takes me to the place when you were mine
where you laid my body down
and then got drunk on me like wine
don't want to feel that bass rattle in my bones
"'cause once i do, i know it won't leave me alone"
"it haunts me, baby, it does me wrong"
"but still, i just can't make myself delete it from my phone"
that song that we used to make love to
that song that we used to make love to
"it kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me"
"i know, i shouldn't say it, but i just wanna play it"
that song that we made love to
"that we made love to, yeah"
i know i'm contradicting everything i said
but i wanna turn it up when i'm lyin' in this bed
pull the sheets over my head
"drift off dreamin', baby, go on, let it take my breath"
that song that we used to make love to
that song that we used to make love to
"it kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me"
"i know i shouldn't say it, but i just wanna play it"
"that song (that song, that song)"
"that we made love to (that song, that song)"
"that we made love to, yeah"
"me and you, you and me"
"on repeat, on repeat"
"me and you, you and me"
"on repeat, on repeat"
that song that we used to make love to
that song that we used to make love to
"it breaks me, it makes me"
wanna hear it again and again and again
that song that we used to make love to
that song that we used to make love to
"it kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me"
"i know i shouldn't say it, but i just wanna play it"
"that song (that song, that song)"
"that we made love to (that song, that song)"
"that we made love to, yeah"
"that song, that song, that song"
"that song, that song, that song"
"that song, that song, that song"
that song that we made love to
"that we made love to, yeah"
i love you more than you'll ever know
and i miss you more than i care to show
i'll get better at pretending nothings wrong its easy when you're always all alone
lately i see leaving in your eyes though nothing you say will come as a surprise
you don't even have to try to be sincere just go on and leave me lyin' here
i'll tell my heart it didnt cause it to break well i'll tell my mind that
i'm the one who made the mistakes and i'll tell my
eyes they don't even have to cry one tear
just go on and leave me lyin' here
so go on and find you someone new
i'll make sure that i am but the fool maybe someday
i'll begin to make it clear you're the one who left me lyin' here
and i'll tell my heart ya didn't cause it to break
and i'll tell my mind that i'm the one who made the mistake
and i'll tell my eyes they dont even have to cry one tear
so go on and leave me lyin' here
just walk away and
leave me lyin' here
see that boy with that guitar
he's got skinny legs like i always wanted
a girlfreind in his car 'cause he's got
skinny legs like i always wanted
sister look at me again
you'd love me if i were as skinny as him
and see that boy with that guitar
he's got a shirt and tie like i always wanted
a girlfriend in his car 'cause he's got
a shirt and tie like i always wanted
sister look at me again
you'd love me if i were a dresser like him
and see that boy with that guitar
he's got a blue toyota like i always wanted
a japanese girl in his car
it's a blue toyota like i always wanted
sister look at me again
you'd love me if i were a driver like him
and see that boy with that guitar
he's got a baby face like i always wanted
a girlfriend in his car 'cause he's got
a baby face like i always wanted
sister look at me again
you'd love me if i were a looker like him
and see that boy with that guitar
he's got a little round...like i always wanted
a girlfriend in his car 'cause he's got
a little round...like i always wanted
sister look at me again
you'd love me if i had a... like him
you'd love me if that my rear end
but legs they come
and faces go
just like old toyotas
that jap girl dumped my ass
and stole my clothes
she took my car
and left me singing
see that boy with that guitar
he's got skinny legs
like i always wanted
a girlfriend in his car 'cause he's got
skinny legs
like i always wanted
skinny legs
like i always wanted
if i needed you
would you come to me
would you come to me
and ease my pain
if you needed me
i would come to you
i'd swim the seas
for to ease your pain
in the night forlorn
"ah, the morning's born"
and the morning shines
with the lights of love
you will miss sunrise
if you close your eyes
that would break
my heart in two
lady's with me now
since i showed her how
to lay her lilly hand in mine
loop and lil agree
she's a sight to see
and a treasure for
the poor to find
"i could hold out my arms, say ""i love you this much"""
i could tell you how long i will long for your touch
how much and how far would i go to prove
the depth and the breadth of my love for you?
from here to the moon and back
who else in this world will love you like that?
"love everlasting, i promise you that"
from here to the moon and back
from here to the moon and back
i want you to know you can always depend
on promises made and love without end
no need to wonder how faithful i'll be
now and on into eternity
from here to the moon and back
who else in this world will love you like that?
"forever and always, i'll be where you're at"
from here to the moon and back
from here to the moon and back
i would blow you a kiss from the star where i sat
i would call out your name to echo through the vast
"thank heaven for you and to god, tip my hat"
from here to the moon and back
and i'll spend forever just proving that fact
from here to the moon and back
lord i fell for her smile
and she loved me for a while
then she said good-bye gotta go
left me standing on the side of the road
now she's gone and i'm a memory in her past
and the long and short of it some things never last
"oh because summers come, summers go"
i'll keep walking down this road
it's alright and it's okay
i'll live to love another day
i'll live to love another day
lord i'm out here again
with my back to the wind
the warm sun that's sinking low
is gonna leave me out in the cold
but the long and short of it some things never last
and if that goes for the good
it must go for the bad
if i fall down
i'm not ashamed
i always get back up again
"but i'll be fine 'till the right one comes to save me, save me, save me"
lord i fell for her smile
and she loved me for a while
and someday she's gonna wish
she hadn't left me here like this
i'll live to love another day
i'll live to love another day
i'll live to love another day
"bows and flows of angel hair, and ice cream castles in the air"
"feathered canyons everywhere, i've looked at clouds that way"
"now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone"
"so many things i could have done, but clouds got in my way"
i've looked at clouds from both sides now from up and down and still somehow
"it's cloud's illusion i recall, i really don't know clouds at all"
moons and junes and farris wheels. the dizzy dancing way you feel
when every fairytale comes real. i've looked at love that way
now that's just another show you leave them laughing when you go
if you care don't let them know don't give yourself away
i've looked at love from both sides now from give and take and still somehow
it's love's illusion i recall i really don't know love at all
tears and fears and feeling proud to say i love you right out loud
dreams and schemes and circus crowds i look at life that way
now old friends are acting strange. they shake their heads they say i've changed
but something's lost and something's gained in living every day
i've looked at life from both sides now from win and lose and still somehow
it's life's illusion i recall. i really don't know life at all
like a long lonely stream i keep running for the dream moving on moving on
like a branch on a tree i keep reaching to be free moving on moving on
there's a place in the sun where there's hope for everyone
where my poor restless heart's gotta run
there's a place in the sun and before my life is done gotta find me a place in the sun
like a dusty old road i get weary from the load moving on moving on
like this tired troubled earth i've been running since my birth moving on moving on
there's a place in the sun...
"that lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink"
"and i can tell by the smell of that perfume, it's like forty dollars too cheap"
and there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread
"well, you drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know i don't drink red"
found it over in the corner
wadded up on the bedroom floor
you shoulda hid it in the closet
"you shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it"
"now i'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry"
"clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line"
"leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you"
all those midnights sneaking in
"""i'm late again, oh, i'm so sorry"""
all the ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry
"if the neighbors get to asking, i won't cover nothin' up"
"i'll tell 'em every little detail, how you drug me through the mud"
i'm gonna string up your old button-down and slide it on the porch
just in case you get the nerve to come knockin' on my door
"yeah, i'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry"
"clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line"
"leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you"
all those midnights sneaking in
"""i'm late again, oh, i'm so sorry"""
all the ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry
found it over in the corner
wadded up on the bedroom floor
you shoulda hid it in the closet
"you shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it"
"now i'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry"
"clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line"
"leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you"
all those midnights sneaking in
"""i'm late again, oh, i'm so sorry"""
all the ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry
(out to dry)
(to the line)
i was sittin' on my doorstep
i hung up the phone
and it fell out of my hand
but i knew i had to do it
and he wouldn't understand...
so hard to see myself without him
i felt a piece of my heart break
but when you're standing at a crossroad
and there's a choice you gotta make...
i guess it's gonna have to hurt
i guess i'm gonna have to cry
and let go of some things i've loved to give to the other side
i guess it's gonna break me down
like falling when you try to fly
sad but sometimes movin' on with the rest of your life
starts with goodbye
i know that there's a blue horizion
somewhere up ahead just waiting for me
but getting there means leaving things behind
sometimes life's so bittersweet
time heals
the wounds that you feel

"won't you come home, bill bailey, won't you come home"
i moan the whole night long
"i'll do the cookin', honey, i'll pay the rent"
i know i done you wrong
remember that rainy eve' that
i drove you out with nothin' but a fine tooth comb
"yes, i know that i'm to blame, and ain't that a shame"
"bill bailey, won't you please come home"
"won't you come home, bill bailey, won't you come home"
i moan the whole night long
"i'm-a gonna do your cookin', honey, i'm-a gonna pay your rent"
i know that i've done you wrong
remember that rainy eve' that
i drove you out with nothin' but a fine tooth comb
"well, i know that i'm to blame, and ain't that a dirty, low-down shame"
"bill bailey, won't you please come home"
"come home, come home, bill bailey"
"bill bailey, won't you please come on home"
"come home, bill bailey"
"bill bailey, won't you please come on home"
you didn't know i wasn't free when you fell in love with me
and with all your young heart you learned to care
it brought you shame and disgrace the world has tumbled in your face
cause they call our love a back street affair
they say you wrecked my home
i'm a husband that's gone wrong
they don't know the sorrow that we've had to bear
for the one that i'm tied to was the first to be untrue
yes they call our love a back street affair
we have each other now that's all that matters anyhow
oh the judgement of gossip's never fair
we'll just be brave and strong then someday they'll see they're wrong
let them call our love a back street affair
we'll be free for love someday when all the talk is dead away
and the happiness we've hoped for then we'll share
i'll climb a mountain high and then the world will hear me cry
that our love is not a back street affair
there's trouble on the streets in this land of the free
freedom has a price and you know it don't come cheap
when our children are tempted left all alone
seeking the values they can't find at home
there's darkness on the playground where did right go wrong
it's nobodys fault but it's here just the same
some kind of disease and no one takes the blame
oh you can say to me what's the use
play too hard you know you'll light the fire
there's darkness on the playground will we win or will we lose
darkness taking all of your dreams
living in shadows is not what it seems
hold on hold me you don't have to die
arms out reaching for a new life
to turn away is easy to follow only fools
and the way back in is hard it's a brand new set of rules
i can't show you any more lies
i only hope that you realize
there's darkness on the playground and nothing left to hide
"get up on your high horse, woman"
get up on your high horse now
"and get up on your high horse, woman"
i'll make it up to you somehow
"moonlit shadow, she starts a trippin' firelight"
jumpin' the trees lyin' across the right of way
silvery mornin' it glistens down the valley
but she don't stop 'til we ride the night away
"get up on your high horse, woman"
get up on your high horse now
"get up on your high horse, woman"
i'll make it up to you somehow
blonde braids tangle at the misty break of mornin'
catchin' light through a dusty window pane
"lost in lust, in denial of the warnin'"
she digs her heels in this stallion's flank again
"get up on your high horse, woman"
get up on your high horse now
"get up on your high horse, woman"
i'll make it up to you somehow
"get up on your high horse, woman"
"you paid the price, you get to play"
"get up on your high horse, woman"
you're gonna ride to the break of day
to the break of day
to the break of day
to the break of day
"get up on your high horse, woman"
get up on your high horse now
"get up on your high horse, woman"
i'll make it up to you somehow
"get up on your high horse, woman"
"you paid the price, you get to play"
"get up on your high horse, woman"
you're gonna ride to the break of day
i'm only a dreamer of romance
my love dreams can never come true
i'll just pretend that i'm happy
and smile thru these tears dear at you
i dreamed of a cabin of love dear
where all of our dreams would come true
but another has taken my cabin
and left me so lonely and blue
nestled around my cabin
that means all the world to me
our love sweet heart will always linger
for you are a part dear of me
where is the love we once cherished
why didn't our love dreams come true
all i can do now is dream dear
of a cabin sweetheart dear and you
nickels and dimes
memories and wines
she's on his mind once again
the same old stool
the same old fool
played by the rules but didn't win
there's an old love in his heart that he can't lose
he tried forgettin' but he knows that it's no use
he's got a fool hearted memory
but it won't let him see
that she walked out the door
he's got a fool hearted memory
he sits patiently
here every night so it can fool him more
she was his girl
his only whirl
that string of pearls that slipped away
a thousand dimes
a thousand times
he doesn't mind what they say
he fills the jukebox
and plays the same old song
he fills his glass
and then he turns her memory on
but it's a fool hearted memory
it won't let him see
that she walked out the door
he's got a fool hearted memory
he sits patiently
here every night so it can fool him more
tonight my heart is sad and weary
wonderin' if i'm wrong or right
i dream about you though you've left me
i wonder where you are tonight
the rain is cold and slowly fallin'
upon my window pane tonight
and though you're love was even colder
i wonder where you are tonight
"it's spring, the birds are gaily singing"
the trees are blossoming so sweet
no other love was quite so happy
no other love was so complete
then came the dawn the day you left me
i tried to smile with all my might
but you could see the pain within me
it still lingers in my heart tonight
"oh, the rain is cold and slowly fallin'"
upon my window pane tonight
and though you're love is even colder
i wonder where you are tonight
"i turn the tv off, to turn it on again"
staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
"counting every crack, the clock is wide awake"
"talking to myself, anything to make a sound"
"i told you i wouldn't call, i told you i wouldn't care"
but baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
i don't think that i can take this bed getting any colder
"come over, come over, come over, come over, come over"
you can say we're done the way you always do
it's easier to lie to me than to yourself
"forget about your friends, you know they're gonna say"
"we're bad for each other, but we ain't good for anyone else"
"i told you i wouldn't call, i told you i wouldn't care"
but baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
i don't think that i can take this bed getting any colder
"come over, come over, come over, come over, come over"
"we don't have to miss each other, come over"
"we don't have to fix each other, come over"
"we don't have to say forever, come over"
"you don't have to stay forever, come over"
"i told you i wouldn't call, i told you i wouldn't care"
but baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
i don't think that i can take this bed getting any colder
"come over, come over, come over, come over, come over"
"come over, come over, come over, come over, come over."
"come over, come over, come over, come over, come over."
"baby, just like you"
it's something new
i just had to try
i didn't plan on it
but a sip and you'll want it
it's a beautiful high
the perfect recipe
"baby, you and me"
the secret's been found
let's pour one right now
i'm talkin' 'bout código
i take it with me everywhere i go
"best tequila, baby, don't you know"
a little sip and you're ready to roll
they make it down in mexico
a little state called jalisco
where the beautiful agaves grow
i'm talkin' 'bout codigo
any way you like it
any way you wanna try it
i'll try it too
i don't care if it's a habit
as long as you have it
and i have it with you
hasta la cruz
i'll be singing it to you
all the way home
we'll make this our song
i'm talkin' 'bout código
i take it with me everywhere i go
"best tequila, baby, don't you know"
a little sip and you're ready to roll
they make it down in mexico
a little state called jalisco
where the beautiful agaves grow
i'm talkin' 'bout código
straight up or on the rocks
dressed up or not
make it a surprise
throw it back and close your eyes
i'm talkin' 'bout código
i take it with me everywhere i go
"best tequila, baby, don't you know"
a little sip and you're ready to roll
they make it down in mexico
a little state called jalisco
where the beautiful agaves grow
i'm talkin' 'bout código
i'm talkin' 'bout código
i take it with me everywhere i go
"best tequila, baby, don't you know"
a little rip and you're ready to roll
they make 'em down in mexico
a little state called jalisco
where the beautiful agaves grow
i'm talkin' 'bout código
where the beautiful agaves grow
i'm talkin' 'bout código
on one hand i count the reasons i could stay with you
"and hold you close to me, all night long."
so many lover's games i could play with you
and on that hand i see no reason why it's wrong
"but on the other hand, there's a golden band"
to remind of someone who would not understand
on one hand i could stay and be your loving man
but the reason i must go is on the other hand
"in your arms i feel the passion, i thought had died"
when i looked into your eyes i found myself
when i first kissed your lips i felt so alive
"i've got to hand it to you girl, you're something else"
"somewhere tonight, there's somebody cryin'"
and feelin' completely alone
"somewhere tonight, there's somebody tryin'"
to find a way back home
mmm-mm i don't know why
mmm-mm but sometimes angels can't fly
how many times have you judged a stranger
shakin' your head in shame
and wondered how could they fall so far
well maybe they're not to blame
mmm-mm i don't know why
mmm-mm but sometimes angels can't fly
they've got their wings and they've got their will
there's blue sky all around
but sometimes it seems that we're destined to be
forever on the ground
"i don't know why, no"
look at us runnin' around in circles
chasin' our peace of mind
searchin' in vain for our wayward halos
that some of us never find
mmm-mm i don't know why
mmm-mm sometimes angels can't fly
mmm and i don't know why
mmm sometimes angels can't fly
mmm
people sit around and they talk and talk
how their dreams all ended too soon
guess they never hung out under the stars
howling at the moon
i guess we're as different as nine and eight
i see it in a different light
i don't think much about the good ol' days
just about the good ol' nights
talk about the good times
talk about the times when the times were right
you can keep the good ol' days i'll take the good ol' nights
[ guitar ]
they wanna go back to when a cadillac
didn't look like a chevrolet
it mean't a lot to them but not a thing to me
i never owned one anyway
but a good looking woman and an old guitar
with both of them tuned just right
well i don't think much about the good ol' days
just about the good ol' nights
talk about the good times...
you can keep the good ol' days i'll take the good ol' nights
we got up before sunup to get the work done up
we'd work in the fields till the sun had gone down
we've stood and we've cried as we helplessly watched
a hailstorm a beatin' our crops to the ground
and i've gone to bed hungry many nights as a lad
in the good old days when times were bad
i've seen daddy's hands break open and bleed
and i've seen him work till he's stiff as a board
i've seen mama lay and suffer in sickness
in need of a doctor we couldn't afford
anything at all was more than we had
in the good old days when times were bad
no ammount of money could buy from me
the mem'ries that i have of them
no ammount of money could pay me
to go back and live through it again
we've got up before we found ice on the floor
where the wind would blew snow
through the cracks in the wall
and i've walked many miles to an old country school
with my luch in a bag of my overalls
anything at all was more than we had
in the good old days when times were bad
no ammount of money could buy from me
the mem'ries that i have of them
no ammount of money could pay me
to go back and live through it again
"well i'm crazy about fast cars, football and guitars"
all them old country songs daddy used to play
"i'm crazy about friday nights, cold beer and good times"
crazy about a summer day out on the lake
but i'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
i'd do about anything you'd ask me to
i'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
but i'm ten times crazier about you
well i'm all about a weekend kickin' with my good friends
every now and then i like to make a little noise
but don't you go thinking that i won't leave em hanging
cause even though i'm crazy about them good ol' boys
i'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
i'd do about anything you'd ask me to
i'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
but i'm ten times crazier about you
i know you love me girl thats easy to see
but as crazy as you say you are about me
i'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
i'd do about anything you'd ask me to
i'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
but i'm ten times crazier about you
i'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
i'd do about anything you'd ask me to
i'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
but i'm ten times crazier about you
it's a thin line
between right and wrong
good and bad
dusk and dawn
it's a thin line
between hate and love
gates of hell
heaven above
it's a thin line
it's a thin line
between joy and being sad
walking lost on the road ahead
water lasting just as fast
it's a thin line
between rich and poor
having too much
needing just a little more
it's a thin line
it's a thin line
between willy and the law
she'd be awful
between your heart and mine
baby it's a thin line
between elvis and jesus
what we love and what he says
your brain brings to you immediately
yeah it's a thin line
it's a thin line
it's a thin line
between right and wrong
good and bad
dusk and dawn
it's a thin line
between hate and love
gates of hell
heaven above
it's a thin line
it's a thin line
between willy and the law
she'd be awful
between your heart and mine
baby it's a thin line
between elvis and jesus
what we love and what he says
your brain brings to you immediately
yeah it's a thin line
it's a thin line
by don chapel
when you left i thought that i would soon be over you
even told myself that i would find somebody new
time and tears have come and gone but not your memory
but i'll be over you when the grass grows over me
yes i'll be over you when you're standing over me
and as you look down at the cold cold ground i'm sleeping in
don't expect to hear me say that i still love you then
'cause i'll be over you when the grass grows over me
even when my eyes are closed they keep on seeing you
every minute of the night i'm hurting through and through
and as long as i'm alive i know i can't be free
but i'll be over you when the grass grows over me
that old white haired judge in dallas
didn't pay my story no mind
they're takin' me down to huntsville
i'm bringin' in a load of time
they caught me on a caper that i planned for days
and proved everything i done
i'm on my way to huntsville
bt i'm looking for a chance to run
my hands don't fit no choppin' pole
and cotton never was my beg
the men better keep both eyes on me
or they're gonna lose old hag
hey there ain't so far to mexico
there i can find my way
they're takin' me down to huntsville
but i'm not gonna stay
they got me chain and leg irons
i guess they got a good excuse
they know i'm gonna run the first chance
i get cause they never gonna cut me loose
and i really don't care if they shoot me down
i'll never be free again
i've got two long life turns to do
both runnin' in the end
hey there ain't so far to mexico
there i can find my way
they're takin' me down to huntsville
but i'm not gonna stay

"average joe, average pay"
same ol' end and same ol' day
but there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
kind of glue that sticks this world together
hands of steel and cradle of the promised land
god bless the working man
all week long making a living
"life keeps takin', he keeps giving"
"behind the scene, below the grade"
hardly noticed but part of everything
but there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
kind of glue that sticks this world together
hands of steel and cradle of the promised land
god bless the working man
he gives his life then fades away
another young man takes his place
"average joe, average pay"
"same ol end, same old' day"
but there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer
kind of glue that sticks this world together
hands of steel and cradle of the promised land
"no, there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer"
kind of glue that sticks this world together
hands of steel and cradle of the promised land
god bless the working man

"oh danny boy, oh danny boy, i love you so."
"and if you come, when all the flowers are dying"
"and i am dead, as dead i well may be"
you'll come and find the place where i am lying
"and kneel and say an ""ave"" there for me."
"and i shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me"
and all my dreams will warm and sweeter be
if you'll not fail to tell me that you love me
i'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
i'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me

sittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon
"in a straightback chair on two legs, leans against the wall"
watch the kids a' playin' with june bugs on a string
and chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall
in my tennessee mountain home
life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
in my tennessee mountain home
crickets sing in the fields near by
honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane
their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
"and on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads it's wings"
an' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody
walkin' home from church on a sunday with the one ya' love
"just laughin', talkin', making future plans"
"and when the folks ain't lookin', you might steal a kiss or two"

i can't be true no matter what i do
"it's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you"
so don't expect it of me though i expect it of you
"i love you, i do, but i can't be true"
men are my weakness i've got a roving eye
and i've fallen victim to many a smile
i just love the excitement of love when it's new
"i'm just a hopeless romantic so i can't be true, i can't be true"
i can't be true no matter what i do
"it's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you"
so don't expect it of me though i expect it of you
"i love you, i do, but i can't be true, i can't be true"
some play it safe while some like it hot
i guess you could say i never knew when to stop
"but when i'm lovin' you, i'll give it all that i got"
it might be different with you to know i can't be true
i can't be true no matter what i do
"oh i get around, and i break all of the rules"
"now that you know it's true, i'll leave the rest up to you"
"i'll be good to you, but i can't be true, i can't be true"
i can't be true no matter what i do
"it's a weakness of mine, its not a weakness in you"
so don't expect it of me though i expect it of you
"i really love you, i do, but i can't be true, i can't be true"
i can't be true no matter what i do
"oh i get around, and i break all of the rules"
"now that you know it's true, i'll leave the rest up to you"
"i'll be good to you, but i can't be true, i can't be true"
i hoped i wouldn't miss you long
but i still can't believe you're gone
and i still miss you just as much as always
i hoped i'd get you off my mind
it's been a long time but i find
that i still think of you as much as always
"as much as always, as much as always"
just as much as always
as much as always just as much as always
"i still miss you, still think of you"
"just as much as always, as much as always"
just as much as always
"i still want you, still need you"
just as much as always
i hoped that i'd find someone else
but there's too much of you still left
"and i still love you , just as much as always"
i hoped that i'd forget your touch
but i still want it just as much
and i still need it just as much as always
"as much as always, as much as always"
just as much as always
"as much as always, just as much as always"
"i still miss you, still think of you"
just as much as always
"as much as always, just as much as always"
"i still love you, oh i do love you"
just as much as always
"as much as always, as much as always"
"i still love you, still want you, just as much as always"
"as much as always, just as much as always"
i still need you still love you
just as much as always
everybody says you let me down i should be ashamed to take you round
makes no difference what you used to do darling i could never be ashamed of you
maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
in my heart i know that you'll come true darling i could never be ashamed of you
(darling i could never be ashamed of you)
all the happiness i've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
and it matters not what we go through darling i could never be ashamed of you
maybe you were cheated in the past and perhaps old memories will always last
but in my heart i know that you'll come true darling i could never be ashamed of you
what to do and where to start?
things are falling all apart
trying hard to move ahead
but keep losing ground instead
still i have to take a chance
putting fear and doubt aside
had no warning in advance
nothing left to do but try
and i just might make it work
i just might make it after all
i just might rise above the hurt
thought i've suffered quite a fall
but i have to get a grip
and hold on to it like a vice
have to face the falling chips
"i just might make it, i just might"
"oh, i might have been a fool"
but its true that love is blind
and you have broken every rule
you've taken all that yours and mine
and how does one go on with life?
when your shattered so inside
pieces of a love gone wrong
"well,ya pick'em up and you move along"
but i just might make it work
i just might make it after all
i just might rise above the hurt
thought i've suffered quite a fall
i just might live to see the day
"i can say ""hey i'm alright, i'm alright, i'm alright"""
i better go on either way
"rise above it, i just might be stronger then i know"
"well, i might even be surprised"
i've got to get on with my life
i just might make it
i just might
nothin left to do but try
i might make it
i just might
the first time i looked in your eyes i knew
that i would do anything for you
the first time you touched my face i felt
like i've never felt with anyone else
i wanna give back what you've givin' to me
and i wanna witness all of your dreams
now that you've shown me who i really am
i wanna be more than just your man
i wanna be the wind that fills your sails
and be the hand that lifts your veil
and be the moon that moves your tide
the sun coming up in your eyes
be the wheels that never rust
and be the spark that lights you up
all that you've been dreaming of and more
"so much more, i wanna be your everything..."
"when you wake up, i'll be the first thing you see"
and when it gets dark you can reach out for me
i'll cherish your words and i'll finish your thoughts
"and i'll be your compass baby, when you get lost"
i wanna be the wind that fills your sails
and be the hand that lifts your veil
and be the moon that moves your tide
the sun coming up in your eyes
be the wheels that never rust
and be the spark that lights you up
all that you've been dreaming of and more
"so much more, i wanna be your everything..."
be the wheels that never rust
and be the spark that lights you up
all that you've been dreaming of and more
"so much more, i wanna be your everything..."
"livin on the road my friend, is gonna keep you free and clean"
now you wear your skin like iron
your breath as hard as kerosene
"you weren't your momma's only boy, but her favorite one it seems"
she began to cry when you said goodbye
and sank into your dreams
"pancho was a bandit boy, his horse was fast as polished steel"
he wore his gun outside his pants
for all the honest world to feel
pancho met his match you know on the deserts down in mexico

"listen poor sinner, you're driftin' away"
from the dear saviour who's pleading to day
what will you do when the saviour ain't nigh
when the pale horse and his rider goes by?
the time now ain't long when the saviour will come
then you'll be judged by the deeds you have done
on that judgment day you'll weep and you'll cry
when the pale horse and his rider goes by
when that trumpet sounds on the sinners below
not even the angels in heaven will know
then's when you'll wish you had jesus nigh
when the pale horse and his rider goes by
won't you redeem your poor wicked soul
you can't pay your way with silver and gold
if you're not saved you'll be lost in the night
when the pale horse and his rider goes by
if i had one call to make
i would dial yesterday
and warn myself
tell my lips the words to say
and not let you just walk away
with someone else
with someone else
next time i won't suffer this kind of pain
all my mistakes i just pass off for the blame
if you were here
we could figure this out
then i wouldn't be bitter
i'd just be better now
to be the strong and silent one
a lot of good that has done
yes you agree
no more trying to understand
or fix these things because you can
guess it's up to me
yeah it's up to me
next time i won't suffer this kind of pain
all my mistakes i just pass off for the blame
if you were here
we could figure this out
then i wouldn't be bitter
i'd just be better now
i'd be much better off
much better off maybe
if i could just let it go
with no regrets left
next time i won't suffer this kind of pain
all my mistakes i just pass off for the blame
you'd still be here
and we'd figure this out
then i wouldn't be bitter
then i wouldn't be bitter
i'd just be better now.
we were just a couple years short of the age
by my name on a fake id
and still 'bout a hundred away from the day
your daddy said you could run with me
we were a couple of line steppers
who just couldn't wait to step over the line
never thinkin' we wouldn't last
i was your first and you were mine
and we were leather jackets hangin' onto a harley
two heartbeats in the moonlight
we were both feet hangin' out over the edge
of the water tower skyline
at least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
though a part of me is always gonna miss her
"i am who i am, i just miss who i was when we were"
mm-hmm
"we were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?"
had it all laid out in our mind
by the time we knew time was runnin' out
we'd done run out of time
and we were downtown saturday night
last-call cover band
'til the last song played
never thought we'd fade
like the stamp on the back of her hand
we were her on my shoulders
lighter in the air
"""pour some sugar on me"""
we were a top down at johnson's field
when she whispered that she wants me
at least there's a little bit
of sweet in the bitter
though a part of me is always gonna miss her
"i am who i am, i just miss who i was"
when we were
"oh, mm-hmm"
we were leather jackets hangin' onto a harley
two heartbeats in the moonlight
we were both feet hangin' out over the edge
of the water tower skyline
at least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
though a part of me is always gonna miss her
"i am who i am, i just miss who i was when we were"
"mm, yes, i do"
my friends say
"""oh well, let that ship sail"
"you gotta let go of her"""

on a day like today
we pass the time away
writing love letters in the sand
how you laughed when i cried
each time i saw the tide
take our love letters from the sand
you made a vow that you
would always be true
"but somehow, that vow"
meant nothing to you
now my poor heart just aches
with ev'ry wave that breaks
over love letters in the sand
you're lookin' at unsatisfied fellow
unhappy well i should say enough
if somebody told me that she cheated
no i wouldn't believe them cause i'm all she's got
i'm the reason that she goes on with him
oh she loves me with all of her heart
no she can't get enough of my lovin'
she'd be nothin' without me cause i'm all she's got
i'm all she's got and that's all i know
anything else would just kill my soul
i'll be contented for if she never stops
saying that she loves me and i'm all she's got
i'll be contented if she never stops
saying she loves me and i'm all she's got
pretty soon this old town i'll be leaving and i'm going just as far as i can go
cause ever since you've put me down i can't stand to stay around
this old town and all the friends we used to know
and when that old north wind comes a howlin' and your cold arms long for company
when the moon peeps through the pines and there's mem'ries on your mind
you're gonna wonder about me babe you're gonna wonder about me
[ harmonica ]
pretty soon you may find that you miss me but by then i'll be many miles away
i may be in baltimore with old friends i knew before
i don't know if that's for sure i can't say
but when that old north wind...
babe you're gonna wonder about me you're gonna wonder about me
babe you're gonna wonder about me

as i lay by your side and hold you tonight
i want you to understand this love that that i feel
is so right and so real i realize how lucky i am
and to you ever wonder if my love is true
there is something that i want to make clear with you
there's no way i could make it without you
there's no way that i'd even try
if i had to survive without you in my life
"i know i wouldn't last a day, oh baby, there's no way"
it means so much to me whenever i see that 'wanting me' look in your eyes
i don't know how i could do without holding you close every night
i've waited so long just to have you to hold
"now that i've got you, i'll never let go"
there's no way i could make it without you
there's no way that i 'd even try
if i had to survive without you in my life
"i know i wouldn't last a day, oh baby, there's no way"

he undresses in the darkness and eases into bed
with her face turned to the other wall she pretends to be asleep
but it doesn't really matter 'cause there's nothing to be said
he calls from work to tell her he's sorry about last night
if he uses all the right words she'll forgive him once again
but the phone just keeps on ringin' and knows something's wrong
"he feels his heart start pounding, and his head begins to spin"
phones are ringin' all over town
north and south and east and west on main street up and down
he's got friends of his callin' friends of hers
but she's nowhere to be found
phones are ringin' all over town
"he calls the hospital, her sister's house and the place that does her hair"
"god, if somethin' ever happened he'd surely lose his mind"
and he's thinkin' it's just like she's disappeared into thin air
as american flight #204 departs right on time
well he knows she'd never leave him
she's just got to be around

have i stayed away too long have i stayed away too long
if i came home tonight would you still be my darling or have i stayed away too long
the love light that shone so strong sweet sweet love light that shone so strong
if i came home tonight would that same light be shining
or have i stayed away too long or have i stayed away too long
tonight i feel a chill in the air
as cold as that look on your face
i hear what you're saying but coming from you
goodbye seems so out of place
now how can you stand there and honestly say
there never wee any real promises made
the moon is my witness
the stars will agree
they all heard you promise
you'd always love me
i know that it's true
but it's hard to believe
you lied to the moon
the stars and me
and what about all of those warm tender nights
did they mean nothing to you
and where are the feelings i thought that we shared
or have you forgotten them too
did you think i could just put your memory behind
when your words are still so very clear in my mind
the moon is my witness
the stars will agree
they all heard you promise
you'd always love me
i know that it's true
but it's hard to believe
you lied to the moon
the stars and me
the moon is my witness
the stars will agree
they all heard you promise
you'd always love me
i know that it's true
but it's hard to believe
you lied to the moon

i know that it's true

you lied to the moon

i’m tilting on the break of shit
decisions making in my life
makes me loose it i ain’t taking it this way i ain’t making it
there n mistakes but if i’m wrong i will pay for it
like them bills i hate to pay
today i stay brave to win every day i’m a soldier
i don’t wanna die. i ain’t know killer either
so why does mama cry?
she needs to feed her child
but she’s a child in her father’s eyes
ya’ll better recognize
the power parents recking with
does it make sense to make way for censorship?
it’s brains we messing with
across the planes we got kids n chains and whips
who live their lives censor less but we couldn’t give a shit.
i don’t wanna lie
cheaters will cheat
some will rather reach jesus
before meeting defeat
i think it’s easy to see i you be seeing these streets
sometimes my eyes

"on tv, young like me sent over seas"
sent over greed i believe
is this what we need?
yo these guys like me.

life twisted my views
just from flicking the news

and suddenly it happened that funny little feelin' i felt
well i tried to outrun it but it finally caught up with me
tell me how can i run from somethin' that i can't see
oh that a little bitty teeny weeny thing called the love bug
nobody's ever seen it but it's got the whole world shook up
it all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug
it's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they called the love bug
[ guitar - fiddle - steel ]
well i always thought that i had me a pretty good style
but i lost that race by a good old country mile
well i was walkin' around with my head held way up high
and it fooled me hit me really took me by surprise
oh that a little bitty teeny weeny thing...
oh that a little bitty teeny weeny thing...

once i lived a life of wine and roses
i drank a lot back then for one concern
success for me lay just around the corner
i thought my social friend would help me make the turn
but now i'm paying for the days of wine and roses
a victim of the drunken life i chose
now all my social friends look down their noses
for i kept the wine and threw away the rose
i stood by and watched the bottle take control of me
the turn i made was not the one i planned
and i watched my social standings slip away from me
as i slowly watched the bottle take command
and now i'm paying for the days of wine and roses
a victim of the drunken life i chose
now all my social friends look down their noses
ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
never have seen a river that's too wide.
ain't no jail tried enough to lock me
ain't no man big enough to stop me
i'll be there if you ever want me by your side.
"so love me, if your ever going to love me"
i never have seen a river that too wide
i'll be there ready and a waiting
there won't be any hesitating
i'll be there if you ever want me by your side.
ain't no road kind enough to bind me
look for me honey and you'll find me
in any old time your ready with your charm
cause i'll be there ready and a waiting
there won't be any hesitating
i'll be there if you ever want me by your side.
"so love me, if your ever going to love me"

i can't get you off of my mind
"when i try, i'm just wastin' my time"
"lord, i've tried and i've tried and all night long i've cried"
but i can't get you off of my mind
"well, you think you would leave me behind"
but i guess you're the good timin' kind
do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart
when i can't get you off of my mind
i can't get you off of my mind
"when i try, i'm just wastin' my time"
"lord, i've tried and i've tried and all night long i've cried"
but i can't get you off of my mind
you believe that a true love is blind
so you fool every new love you find
"you've got stars in your eyes, but they can't hide the lies"
i can't get you off of my mind
i can't get you off of my mind
"when i try, i'm just wastin' my time"
"lord, i've tried and i've tried and all night long i've cried"
but i can't get you off of my mind
if you like a man who
you can put your trust in
you don't have to worry
where he's been
then rest easy
"girl, you're gonna love me"
and if you like to slow dance
to ol' keith whitley
long sunday drives out
in the country
i'm your cup of tea
"girl, you're gonna love me"
come and rest your head against my chest
'cause i'm the one for you
you don't have to look no more
your search is through
so girl if you like a handful
of fresh wild flowers
a back rub on a bad day
talkin' for hours
i'm good company
girl you're gonna love me
come and rest your head against my chest
'cause i'm the one for you
you don't have to look no more
your search is through
so girl if you like a big heart
that's in this for the long haul
till we're rockin' on the front porch
and they're callin' me papaw
till the last breath you breathe
girl you're gonna love me
just try it and see
girl you're gonna love me

it's you that i am thinkin' of
"as i read the lines that, to me, were so dear"
i remember our faded love
"i miss you darlin', more and more every day"
as heaven would miss the stars the above
"with every heartbeat, i still think of you"
and remember our faded love
as i think of the past and all the pleasures we had
as i watch the mating of the dove
it was in the springtime that you said goodbye

said there moving to l.a.
there ain't a soul i know around
everybody's leaving town

find the sunshine leave the rain
they say this town will waste your mind
i guess they're right cause it's wasted mine

of jesus and his love.
"i love to tell the story,"
because i know 'tis true;
it satisfies my longings
as nothing else can do.

"i love to tell the story,"
"'twill be my theme in glory,"
"to tell the old, old story"
of jesus and his love.
"i love to tell the story,"
for those who know it best
seem hungering and thirsting
to hear it like the rest.
"and when, in scenes of glory,"
"i sing the new, new song,"
"'twill be the old, old story"
that i have loved so long.

"anyway, talk on y'all later"
your love i'm no longer sure of seems there's times you'd rather be alone
and if i'm losing you tell me what did i do oh i wonder just where i went wrong
even though i still feel the same i can't help but feel i'm to blame

oh i wonder just where i went wrong

but i'm finally here in that
i'm picking up the pieces
i'm walking back into the light
untill the sunset of your glory
where my heart infilter life
there's nothing like that feeling
when i look into your eyes
my dreams came true when i found you
"i found you, my miracle"
if you could see what i see
that you are the answer to my praies
and if you could feel
the tenderness i feel
"you would know, it would be clear"
that angels brought me here
"oh, i'll be here to be with you"
i'll be forever thankful
"oh, forever thankful"
"my dreams came true when i found you, my miracle"
if you could see what i see
that you are the answer to my praies
"oh, and if you could feel"
the tenderness i feel
"you would know, it would be clear"
that angels brought me here
(if you could see what i see
that you are the answer to my praies)
"oh, and if you could feel"
the tenderness i feel
"you would know, it would be clear"
that angels brought me here
everybody knows you been steppin' on my toes and i'm gettin' pretty tired of it
you keep a steppin' out of line and a messin' with my mind
if you had any sense you'd quit
cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
you said i was the only man in this whole world
now you bettter do some thinking then you'll find
you got the only daddy that'll walk the line
i keep a working every day all you wanna do is play i'm tired of stayin' out all night
i'm a comin' unglued from your funny little moods now honey baby that ain't right
cause ever since you were...
[ guitar ]
you keep a packin' up my clothes nearly everybody knows
that you're still just a puttin' me on
when i start a walking gonna hear you start a squawking
and a beggin' me to come back home
cause ever since you were...a little bitty teeny girl you said i was the only man in this whole world now you better do some thinkin then you'll find you got the only daddy that'll walk the line
you got the only daddy that'll walk the line
we fell into a fallin’ out
you are the one that i just can’t figure out
but i do believe i want to
like a girl in a picture show
you are the one that i’d like to know
"and i do, i do believe i need to"
"and i do, i do believe that i feel like"
i’m watching a dove that’s falling
it’s love and it’s going down
the songbird is calling a slipaway darling
so if there’s a way show me how
just to tell you i love you
you don’t have to show me what’s in your eyes
find me a way to apologize and i will
i do believe i need to
and you can take forever to sympathize
but you know it’s raining in my insides
"‘cause i do, i do believe i love you"
"and i do, i do believe that i feel like"
i’m watching a dove that’s falling
it’s love and it’s going down
the songbird is calling a slipaway darling
so if there’s a way show me how
just to tell you i love you
i feel a broken heart tumblin’
do you remember what you said way back then
you used to say i love you
and lost in the light of a second chance
i feel the rhythm but you won’t dance
"and i do, i do believe i need to"
"and i do, i do believe that i feel like"
i’m watching a dove that’s falling
it’s love and it’s going down
the songbird is calling a slipaway darling
so if there’s a way show me how
just to tell you i love you
everybody says itâ€™s going to a little time
might as well get used to her running through my mind
her memory brought me to my knees
when will i be back up walking
only time will tell but it ainâ€™t talking
lot of sleepless nights iâ€™m sure are lying up ahead
wondering when the night will come when i lay down in bed
and her memory finally decides to stop calling
"only time will tell, but it ainâ€™t talking"
only time will tell when i will finally be free
but so far it hasnâ€™t spoken a single word to me
wonder when the pain will end
and all the tears will stop falling
"only time will tell, but it ainâ€™t talking"
only time will tell when i will finally be free
but so far it hasnâ€™t spoken a single word to me
wonder when the pain will end
and all the tears will stop falling
"only time will tell, but it ainâ€™t talking"
they call me a playboy
as i'm making my rounds
chasing the bright light
of each night spot in town
"though i never show it,"
my heart's breaking in two
they may call me a playboy
but i'm just lonesome for you
i once had a real love
that was when i had you
now i'll never feel love
with somebody new
this false front i'm wearing
is just to cover my blues
they may call me a playboy
but. i'm just lonesome for you

"jesus, sweet jesus if you're listening"
can you pass me to your pa.
i'm having a hard time understanding
why he's so cruel and demanding
with his love.
"darling, sweet darling keep whispering"
i'll find you through this din.
"sitting and watching,"
two flames busy dancing
to our love.
"grab on to this moment, inhale it"
and hold it inside.
"savour its sweetness,"
yearn for the slide.
"jesus, sweet jesus if you're listening"
can you pass me to your pa.
i'm having a hard time understanding
why he's so discriminating
with his love.
got an easy place to be
"in my arms, yeah in my arms"
i got a simple space to feel free
"in my arms, in my arms"
keep it on the recent
keep it on the now
give me an easy way out
it's a lovely world that i got
"in my arms, baby in my arms"
got a lot of room to get lost
"in my arms, baby in my arms"
keep it on the recent
keep it on the now
give me an easy way out
keep it on the recent
keep it on the now
give me an easy way out
got an easy place to be

you got nothing to fear from me
"in my arms, baby in my arms"
"in my arms, baby in my arms"
(george)
my shoulder still burns
where you touched me last night
you hugged me and walked out the door
we've been pretending
that we're only friends
but tonight we can feel something more.
(both)
just being around you
is making me warm
one touch and i know that i'll
melt in your arms
there's no way to stop
this burning desire
'cause there's nothing as hot as a
slow burning fire.
(tammy)
you look in my eyes
just a little too long
before i can look away
but lately i've caught you
staring at me
with a new kind of look on your face.
(both)
just being around you
is making me warm
one touch and i know that i'll
melt in your arms
there's no way to stop
this burning desire
'cause there's nothing as hot as a
slow burning fire.

i like kickin' back on the sofa
flippin' through the channels just to see what's on
i enjoy eatin' eggs over easy
soppin' up with a biscuit 'til the yellow's gone
ain't nothin' like watchin' a bunch of young'ns
run screamin' through the sprinkler in their little bare feet
and ain't nothin' like finding twenty dollars
in the pocket of the britches that you wore last week
i get into getting out on my mower
in the early mornin' hours 'fore the sun gets hot
and i like goin' down to the kroger
when the carnival comes to the parkin' lot
ain't nothin' like throwing a hula popper
draggin' it across a spot a big 'un oughta be
and ain't nothin' like having him for supper
with some good hush puppies and some sweet iced tea
this old world is full of simple pleasures
they're all good but some are better
ain't nothin' like finding that woman
that you know you're gonna love for the rest of your life
and ain't nothin' like knowing the lord's a comin'
back one day to make you want to do it right
"you are my sunshine, my only sunshine"
you make me happy when skies are gray
"you'll never know dear, how much i love you"
please don't take my sunshine away
i'll always love you and make you happy
if you will only say the same
but if you leave me for another
you'll regret it all some day
"you are my sunshine, my only sunshine"
you make me happy when skies are gray
"you'll never know dear, how much i love you"
so please don't take my sunshine away
"the other night dear, as i lay sleeping"
i dreamed i held you in my arms
"but when i awoke, dear, i was mistaken"
so i hung my head and i cried
"you are my sunshine, my only sunshine"
you make me happy when skies are gray
"you'll never know dear, how much i love you"
please don't take my sunshine away
"you are my sunshine, my only sunshine"
you make me happy when skies are gray
"you'll never know dear, how much i love you"
please don't take my sunshine away
please don't take my sunshine away
"i'd like to hold my head up and be proud of who i am,"
but they won't let my secret go untold.
"i paid the debt i owed them, but they're still not satisfied,"
"now i'm a branded man out in the cold,"
"when they let me out of prison, i held my head up high,"
determined i would rise above the shame.
"but no matter where i travel, the black mark follows me,"
i'm branded with a number on my name.
"i'd like to hold my head up and be proud of who i am,"
but they won't let my secret go untold.
"i paid the debt i owed them, but they're still not satisfied,"
"now i'm a branded man out in the cold,"
"if i live to be a hundred, guess i'll never clear my name,"
'cause everybody knows i've been in jail.
"no matter where i'm living,"
"i've got to tell them where i've been,"
or they'll send me back to prison if i fail.
"i'd like to hold my head up and be proud of who i am,"
but they won't let my secret go untold.
"i paid the debt i owed them, but they're still not satisfied,"
"now i'm a branded man out in the cold,"
now i'm a branded man out in the cold
lately nothing i do
ever seems to please you
and maybe turning my back
would be that much easier
cause hurtful words are all that we exchange
but i can't watch you walk away
cause i forget about the way it feels to touch you
and all about the good times that we've been through
could i wake up without you everyday
and would i let you walk away?
"no, i can't i learn to live without"
and i can't give up on us now
i know i could say we're through?
and tell myself i'm over you
but even if i made a vow
a promise not to miss you now
and try to hide the truth inside
i fail cause i...
i just can't live a lie
could i forget the look that tells me what you want me
and all the reasons that make lovin' you so easy?
the kiss that always makes it hard to breathe
that way you know just what i mean
no i can't learn to live without
so don't you give up on us now
and i don't wanna try
oooooh...

"well, i'm chasin' the blues"
right out of my mind
i'm leavin' my cares
and worries behind
cause i'm on my way
i'm leavin' town today
my lonesome old heart
is broken into
i've been walkin' the floor
every night over you
but our love is all gone
i'm movin' on
i'm a-leavin' town today
"i got no love, no cares"
just heartaches
i'm leavin' them all behind
like the sun and the moon
and the stars above
we're gonna be one of a kind
"well, i'm movin' along"
i gotta be free
i'll find a new love
wherever i'll be
but my old love is gone
i'm movin' on
i'm a-leavin' town today
"i got no love, no cares"
no heartaches
i'm leavin' them all behind

i feel the fingerprints
that you left on my heart
you played a game of love
and then you said we had to part
you left me all alone
and as the teardrops start
i feel the fingerprints
of sorrow on my heart
i know you didn't mean to be unkind
and hurt me so
and you've made up your mind
but i just thought you ought to know
that when the day is thru
i think of only you
i sit alone and dream
and think of things we didn't do
now i am all alone
and as the teardrops start
i feel the fingerprints
that you left on my heart
and when the day is thru
i think of only you
i sit alone and dream
and think of things we didn't do
now i am all alone
and as the teardrops start
i feel the fingerprints
that you left on my heart
"blue me, blue me"
blue is the color
that fits best on me
i'm blue
just as blue as can be
"blue me, blue me"
i cry
and i die
i lie awake at night
and i question why
must it be
i can never be free
"blue me, blue me"
my heart is heavy
but it's empty inside
no one to love me
or to lay down beside
i'm blue
the queen of sorrow
wears royal blue
my luck ain't changin'
is it ever goin' to
"i'm blue, oh i'm blue"
why must i wear this robe of blue misery
"blue me, blue me"
ooh
this sad old feeling
is breakin' me down
no satisfaction with these blues hangin' 'round
"lord, i'm blue"
"oh, i'm so blue"
why can't i shake it tell me where will this end
when will i get out of this blue rut i'm in
"oh, i'm blue"
looks like the blues just took a liking to me
"blue me, blue me"
"blue me, blue me"
blue is the color that fits best on me
"ooooh, i'm blue"
i'm just as blue as can be
"blue me,"
blue me
across a crowded room
i can't keep my eyes off you
you take my breath away
looking at me now
i know what you are thinking about
you are thinking about the way
you woke me up this morning and made sweet love to me
oh baby
i love the way you touch me
you know my body so well
you do much more to love me
til i'm overwhelmed
wrapped up inside of you is where i want to be
because no body knows
no body knows
no body knows the secrets that we keep
once we get inside these four walls
all the hesitation falls
we can't wait no more
as you help me get undressed you don't have to guess
baby you know what i want
i want to love you til the sun comes up
til i am sure you are satisfied
oh baby
i love the way you touch me
you know my body so well
you do much more to love me
til i'm overwhelmed
wrapped up inside of you is where i want to be
"because no body knows, no body knows"
"the secrets that we keep, yeah."
"ohh, wrapped up inside of you"
is where i want to be
'cause no body knows
no body knows
no body knows

i've got a pocket full of pennies the heart full of gold
though my troubles are many i have treasures untold
and the shack that i live in is a palace to me
for the treasure of love the treasure of love you gave to me
[ steel + fiddle ]
in this world there are riches that money can't buy
like the treasure of true love a love that won't die
so why should i worry what tomorrow will bring
for the treasure of love the treasure of love makes me a king
[ fiddle ]
though my clothes are all tattered and i've seen better days
know it really don't matter for i'm rich another way
yes my pockets are empty but still wealthy i'll be
with the treasure of love the treasure of love you gave to me
devil had a daughter
took him to deep water
tried to kill him with a kiss
he said hey now honey
what about the money
i said i ain?t got time for this
take me take me somewhere trouble don?t go
make me make me someone trouble don?t know
he said baby come inside
i said sorry i got to ride
sorry but i got to ride
you know you could end up dead
for sleeping in the devil?s bed
sleeping in a devil?s bed
take me take me somewhere trouble don?t go
make me make me someone trouble don?t know
baby wants to drive my car
but he wants to go too far
but he wants to go too far
first comes love and it?s so fine
then comes heartache right behind
then comes heartache behind
my baby used to be so sweet
now he won?t come down my street
now he won?t come down my street
all my plans got derailed
he locked up my heart in jail
he locked up my heart in jail
take me take me somewhere trouble don?t go
make me make me someone trouble don?t know
take me take me somewhere trouble don?t go
make me make me someone trouble don?t know
i once was lost in sin but jesus took me in
and then a little light from heaven filled my soul
it bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
and just a little talk with jesus made me whole
now let us have a little talk with jesus
let us tell him all about our troubles
he will hear our famished cry
he will answer by and by
now when you feel a little prayer turning
and you know the little talk with jesus makes it right
sometimes my path seems dreary without a ray of cheer
and then the cloud about me hides the light of day
the mists in me rise and hide the stormy skies
but just a little talk with jesus clears the way
i may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
but jesus is a friend who watches day and and night
i go to him in prayer he knows my every care
and just a little talk with jesus makes it right
you will find a little talk with jesus makes it right
makes everything right
"well, santa looked a lot like daddy"
or daddy looked a lot like him
it's not the way i had him pictured
santa was much too thin
he didn't come down the chimney
so mama must have let him in
santa looked a lot like daddy
or daddy looked a lot like him
"well, they thought i was fast a sleepin'"
they thought that i was tucked in bed
they never thought i'd come a peepin'
or that i'd hear what was said
santa put his arm around mama
and mama put her arm around him
so if santa claus ain't daddy
then i'm a gonna tell on him
i never saw dancer or prancer
i never heard the sleigh bells ring
i never saw the red nosed reindeer
like they show on the tv screen
but he sure brought a lot presents
so santa claus he must have been
"well, he sure looked a lot like daddy"
or daddy looked a lot like him.
santa looked a lot like daddy
or daddy looked a lot like him
somewhere in the mountains.........in northern alabama
the carolina lady waits for her man from tennessee
somewhere in a motel......out in oklahoma
there's the alabama dreamer
that same man from tennessee
sometime late at night......the lonely wakes her gently
and knocks at her door......but she won't give in
but like every other woman........she needs to feel wanted
she thinks of making love.......and goes to sleep again
carolina.........dreamin' lonely
carolina.........can't you see
you will always be the lady.....
that i dream of holding tight.....
that i kiss and tell goodnight.....
carolina.......mountain dewe
sometime that next day.....on a mississippi freeway
the alabama dreamer........is homeward bound
his conscious is as clear........as those green eyes of carolina
and she's waiting with the baby from the love..............of the only man to
lay her down
carolina..........dreaming lonely
carolina..........can't you see
you will always be the lady
that i dream of holding tight
that i kiss and tell goodnight
carolina......mountain dewe
carolina..........i love you
there's a little mountain church in my thoughts of yesterday
where friends and family gathered for the lord
where an ol' fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow way
for what few coins the congregation could afford
"dressed in all our sunday best, we sat on pews of solid oak"
and i remember how our voices filled the air
how mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes
"and ""when the roll is called up yonder i'll be there"""
looking back now that little mountain church house
has become my lifes cornerstone
it was there in that little mountain church house
i first heard the words i based my life upon
"at the all day sunday singing, with dinner on the ground"
many were the souls that were revived
while the brothers and the sisters who've gone on to gloryland
slept in peace in the maple grove nearby
somewhere out there on the prairie alone my guardian angel devine
is there at rest somewhere in the west that pioneer mother of mine
i'd give all i own today if someone would guide my way
to that hallowed spot where she's sleeping that pioneer mother of mine
there is nothing left of her busy life but the things she made when her days were full
a couple of rugs on the kitchen floor and an afagan knitted out of bits of wool
her garden has a deserted look and the weeds show up in the sunshine smile she is dead
and the things she fought run wild and you stop and think was her life worth while
but if you had known as well as i knew the quiet good and the helping hand
and the neighborly warm big heart of hers i think you would really understand
that not all the people that we call great are really greatest in the end
and perhaps the finest thing in life is a homely common every day friend
so the little life with the homely tasks has worked it's pattern and so goes on
what if the weeds grow rank again and what if the flowers are dead and gone
ah the little woman of small account with the cheerful smile on her brave old face will never die
for the tide of years will produce her like to take her place
i'd give all i own today if someone would guide my way
to that hallowed spot where she's sleeping that pioneer mother of mine
we gather tonight for a celebration
under the flag of a no-shoes nation
"speakin' our gospel, seekin' our truth"
brothers in arms and sisters and cowboys
(who gets to live like we do?)
raisin' the roof
(who get to live like we do?)
we come down from the mountains
come up from the coast
we're all comin' out of somethin' kinda comatose
fill up our cups with a little bit of freedom
"come on, hold 'em up, everybody let me see 'em"
"yeah, we laugh and we love"
and we can't get enough
as loud as were livin' and we still turn it up
"we're amplified, come alive, side by side"
"no matter where it goes, you know we here for the ride"
who gets to roll like we do? (we do)
"yeah, who wants to rock like we do? (we do)"
"yeah, who ain't gonna stop, man, no matter what?"
and who gets to live like we do? (we do)
we drag this circus from town to town
"full of jesters, and jokers, and barroom clowns"
"to your parkin' lot, parties full of pirates like us"
and we all come together when the curtain comes up
"yeah, we laugh and we love"
and we can't get enough
as loud as were livin' and we still turn it up
"we're amplified, come alive, side by side"
"no matter where it goes, you know we here for the ride"
who gets to roll like we do? (we do)
"yeah, who wants to rock like we do? (we do)"
"yeah, who ain't gonna stop, man, no matter what?"
and who gets to live like we do? (we do)
not really sure who's liftin' up who
"you came to see us, we came to see you too"
"yeah, it's true"
and who gets as high as we do? (we do)
who touches the sky like we do? (we do)
"yeah, we laugh and we love"
and we can't get enough
as loud as we livin' and we still turn it up
"we're amplified, come alive, side by side"
"no matter where it goes, you know we here for the ride"
who gets to roll like we do? (we do)
"yeah, who wants to rock like we do? (we do)"
"yeah, who ain't gonna stop, man, no matter what?"
and who gets to live like we do? (we do)
twenty-five minutes past quitting time
seven of us crammed into that truck of mine
paying no attention to them highway signs
doing ninety miles an hour toward the county line
"quick sack, twelve pack, back again"
it's a b double e double r-u-n.
my buddies and their babies letting down their hair
as long as we're together is don't matter where
ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care
knowing half the fun is in the getting there
"aztec, long necks, paychecks spent"
"oh, it's a b double e double r-u-n."
i can't stop thinking
what the hell they were drinking
whan they made this county dry
i got a week-long thirst
and to make it worse
"lord, it's my turn to drive"
laughing and bragging and a' carrying on
we loaded up the wagons and we headed home
i guess half a dozen cases doesn't last that long
come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone
"them, it's turn around, leave town, sounds again"
like a b double e double r-u-n.
came into the world on it
they'll bury me six feet down in the ground when i'm gone in it
"it's where i grew up, i've lived and loved and prayed"
it's where i wanna be on my last dying day
that knows everything about me
ga clay
in the ga clay where i was born and raised
hell in my childhood days
"if you see my roots, they're all stained red"
when i'm gone all that's left
are bones and a stone when i go home
to the ga clay
ga clay
learned to drive on it
still stuck on the tires since daddy broke ground
put seeds in it
it's where i laid my first love down 'neath a southern sky
it was on my boots and it carried her home on time
it knows everything about me
ga clay
in the ga clay where i was born and raised
hell in my childhood days
"if you see my roots, they're all stained red"
when i'm gone that's all that's left
bones and stone when i go home
"ooh, ga clay (bones and stone when i)"
"ooh, ooh, ga clay (bones and stone)"
ga clay (bones and stone when i go home)
ga clay (bones and stone when i go home)
ga clay where i was born and raised
hell in my childhood days
"if you see my roots, they're all stained red"
when i'm gone all that's left
are bones and a stone when i go home
to the ga clay
i'm just here to get my things and i'll be leaving
and i've got somebody waitin' just outside
so don't start to cry to me about your hurt and misery
cause the only thing that's hurtin' is your pride
wave goodbye to me and i'll be leaving walk me to the door and say so long
no need talking anymore saying things i've heard before
just wave goodbye to me and i'll be gone gone gone gone
wave goodbye to me and i'll be gone
[ guitar ]
go tell all our friends that i'm a cheater tell 'em how i caused you all this pain
but if they start asking you just why i proved untrue
that might not be so easy to explain
just wave goodbye to me...
wave goodbye to me...
gone gone gone wave goodbye to me and i'll be gone
"oh, holy night"
the stars are brightly shining
it is the night our dear saviour's birth
long lay the world in sin and error pining
'til he appeared
and the soul felt it's worth
a thrill of hope
the weary world rejoices
for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
fall on your knees
"oh, hear the angel voices"
"oh, night divine"
"oh, night"
when christ was born
"oh, night divine"
oh night

fall on your knees
"oh, hear the angel voices"
"oh, night divine"
"oh, night"
when christ was born
"oh, night divine"
"oh, night"
"oh, holy night"
its been so long since you felt like you were loved
so what went wrong?
but do you know
there's a place where you belong
here in my arms?
when you feel like you're alone in your sadness
and it seems like no one in this whole world cares
& you wanna get away from the madness
you just call my name & i'll be there
you just call my name and i'll be there
the pain inside rest or hope for love
and soon you will find that i'll give you all that your heart
could ever want and so much more
when you feel like you're alone in your sadness
and it seems like no one in this whole world cares
and you wanna get away from the madness
you just call my name & i'll be there x3
just call my name
"call my name, say it now"
i want you to never down
the love i have for you is so alive x2
"oh, you just call my name"
you just call my name
we drank all the wine
and we burned all the candles to the ground
we danced to every dance they played 'til silence seemed to be the only sound
and i could've sworn not long ago
the sun was only startin' to go down
but when did all the stars
fade just like the moon?
and how'd it get so late so soon?
twilight was just leavin'
when the first kiss of the evening got us high
and time stood at a standstill when the whole world just stopped for you and i
"and that last kiss you gave me, baby, just lit up the sky"
when did that early bird
start singin' his first tune?
how'd it get so late so soon?
"oh, i could've sworn not long ago"
the sun was only startin' to go down
but when did all the stars
fade just like the moon?
when did that early bird
start singin' his first tune?
and how'd it get so late so soon?
you take the lady...i'll take the lesson
i can't say that anyone's...doin' me wrong
cause i allways knew....that the girl had a weakness
for whistlers and jugglers....and singers of songs
now she was a child...back when i first met her
and the woman inside her...was just bein' born
and i knew she'd come with me...cause she had a fever
for whistlers and jugglers...and singers of songs.
and the whistler will whistle her...a song she can dance to
and jugglers will cheer her...when she starts to cry
the singer will sing her.....a bed of red roses]
where she might let you....lie by her side
she'll laugh in the face...of the wealthy and famous
and you'll never lose her..to the handsome or strong
but all of your life son...watch over your shoulder
for whistlers and jusgglers...and singers of songas..
"glory to his name, oh, holy, holy"
there's a city where the streets are paved in gold
a land where the milk and the honey flow
and a mansion which for me
'cause my bible tells the story
i just hope my feet are clean enough
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
green meadows where the little children play
"no sorrow there, just one long happy day"
and none will litter there except the pure and the holy
i just hope my feet are clean enough
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
and when i've reached my journey's end
and if i'm worthy to go in
"golden streets of glory, i walk on"
and the golden streets of my new home
will lead me up to the master's throne
with the angel band i'll sing
"glory to his name, oh, holy, holy"
i just hope my feet are clean enough
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
"hallelujah, i just hope my feet are clean enough"
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
and when i've reached my journey's end
and if i'm worthy to go in
"golden streets of glory, i'll walk on"
and the golden streets of my new home
will lead me up to the master's throne
with the angel band i'll sing
"glory to his name, oh, holy, holy"
i just hope my feet are clean enough
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
"hallelujah, i just hope my feet are clean enough"
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
it was clear i had to meet her
from the first time she walked by
see the second that i seen her
knew i had to make her mine
and just a game of pool
a little shot on a stool
and i already had her digits
get down to business
ain't no sense in wastin' time
feels like we flyin' down the highway
spinnin' out sideways
hundred miles and out we go
top down fastback
nascar short track
burnin' rubber down the road
"when we talkin', then we touchin'"
then we kissin' in a hurry
yeah we're kickin' up a cloud of dust
'cause girl we're movin'
movin' at the speed of love
(that's right)
yeah this story's real
as the orange peal
left on the barroom floor
we meant every word
of that don't disturb
hangin' on that hotel door
'cause we was makin' out
and we was knockin' boots
and it was just last night
we was introduced
i guess time flies
when you're movin' at the speed of love
feels like we flyin' down the highway
spinnin' out sideways
hundred miles and out we go
top down fastback
nascar short track
burnin' rubber down the road
"when we talkin', then we touchin'"
then we kissin' in a hurry
yeah we're kickin' up a cloud of dust
'cause girl we're movin'
movin' at the speed of love
yeah we got off tour
and i ran to the store
just to check out a diamond ring
"got a girl, she gorgeous"
yeah that's who this is for
and it's only been a couple weeks
feels like we flyin' down the highway
spinnin' out sideways
hundred miles and out we go
top down fastback
nascar short track
burnin' rubber down the road
"when we talkin', then we touchin'"
then we kissin' in a hurry
yeah we're kickin' up a cloud of dust
'cause girl we're movin'
movin' at the speed of love
we can't stop movin'
movin' at the speed of love
(that's right)
"(come on now, keep up)"

they's some of you in the audience that may or may not know i wasn't actually born here in muskogee
but my family on my mother's side lived here for many years
and i think most all of my dad's folks were born in between here and checotah somewhere
and around brush hill you know where brush hill or kneebow mountain or somewhere over
and i've heard 'em talk so many times about it that when i finally began to tour on the road
we made a special plan to come through here and kinda look around and see where they used to live
and muskogee was a word and town that i've heard about ever since i was knee high
and the fact that oklahoma for some reason or another has been able to keep out of the conflict
and the college campuses haven't had any trouble that i know of they haven't been in news anyway
and as far as i know just about hippy free i haven't seen any hippies around here either
except of course except for carlton i mean he
course carlton's a country hippy now we can allow that see
carlton's just short of money that's the only thing wrong with him
he's broke see he had too many merle haggard shows
no seriously these things and the fact that like i say i was very familar with muskogee
the ideas came together and we wrote a song called okie from muskogee
goes like
one two three four
all aboard?
"it was a big night in december, chattanooga tennessee"
all the old folks still remember that snowy christmas eve
the way santa saved that holiday
it's still hard to believe
oh the weather man was calling for the snow
to keep comin' down
and the way that it was fallin'
rudolph never saw the ground
"by christmas day, santa's sleigh never made it to town"
then all at once they heard that mighty whistle blow
(ha ha)
"the ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe"
and then comin' 'round the mountain
right through the steam and smoke
pullin; 16 coaches shoutin' ho ho ho
"who needs a sleigh, santa's got a choo-choo train"
"well now, he could barely hold it"
comin' down the hill so fast
yeah that shiny locomotive made it town in no time flat
but you can't go slow with a christmas load
coming down the railroad tracks
when he pulled into the station
and he finally shut her down
"there was a big ol celebration, everyone gathered 'round"
they passed out toys
to the girls and boys from miles around
then all at once they heard a mighty whistle blow
(ha ha)
the ground started shaken'
it even shook the mistletoe
and then goin' 'round the mountain
right through the steam and smoke
pullin; 16 coaches shoutin' ho ho ho
who needs a sleigh
when santa's got a choo-choo train
"oh yeah, no need to fly away, santa's got a choo-choo train!"
white lightnin'
(written by s. wooley)
"well in north carolina, way back in the hills"
lived my old pappy and he had him a still
he brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down
then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around
"mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin'"
whshhhoooh . . white lightnin'
"well the ""g"" men ""t"" men revenuers, too"
searchin' for the place where he made his brew
"they were looking, tryin to book him,"
but my pappy kept a-cookin'
mmmm . . white lightnin'
well i asked my old pappy why he called his brew
white lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew
i took a little sip and right away i knew
as my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
"thunder started crashin', lightnin' started flashin..."
mmmmm . . white lightnin'
"well a city slicker came and he said ""i'm tough"""
i think i wanna taste that powerful stuff
he took one slug and drank it on down
and i heard him a moanin' as he hit the ground
"thunder started crashin', lightnin started flashin"
mmmmm.... white lightnin'
if there's a chance that your heart misses the words i try to say with kisses
if i don't seem to look as happy as i should
i wouldn't want to live without you i love everything about you
yes even the bad times are good
your middle name should be perfection cause that's what you are to me
even in my darkest moments you make it easier to see
i wouldn't change one thing about you if i knew that i could
yes even the bad times are good
[ steel ]
you never let me feel mistreated your love is all i've ever needed
when i was weak somehow you always understood
you're not afraid of stormy weather and that's what keeps our love together
yes even the bad times are good
your middle name should be perfection...
even the bad times are good
silver sandals.
in silver sandals she goes walkin' up those golden stairs
and though we miss her so we know she's happy to be there
she walks with us in memory we see her all the time
in silver sandals walkin' through our minds.
so many times we let our thoughts turn back to yesterday
to a little girl that could only watch the children as they played
she walks with us in memories we see her all the time
in silver sandals walkin' through our minds
the grave in which she sleeps is cold but our thoughts of her are warm
and we cry as we both long to hold her in our arms
each night in dreams we see her running to us smiling sweet
with silver sandals on her feet
in silver sandals she goes walkin' ...
she had asked for sandals from the time that she could talk
and it would break our hearts when she'd asked us why she couldn't walk
she'd say when i go to heaven can i change my crutches then
for a pair of silver sandals at the rainbow's end
in silver sandals she goes walkin'...
in silver sandals she goes walkin' through our minds.
"written by danny dill, carl perkins and mel tillis"
"i've been so wrong, for so long"
thought i could live without the love that you give
"i was wrong, oh, so wrong"
"i've been so wrong, for so long"
i didn't know that i loved you so
i was wrong
"well, i never knew i could want you darlin"
"oh, so much"
"now that you're gone, i dream of you"
and your sweet touch
"i was so wrong, for so long"
"but i've seen the light, darlin, i'll make it right"
i was wrong

i had a hundred dollar ring in my hand
so weak and tired i could barely stand
from bein up all night praying she'd say yes
so with a hopeful heart i hit one knee
with a tear in her eye she looked at me
"it was the moment of truth, i was scared to death."
my life hung on what that tear meant
"then she smiled at me, and i lost it..."
"no one can make me cry, make me laugh"
"make me smile or drive me mad, like she does"
it's like a curse that is the cure
"better or worse, one thing's for sure"
it's real love
and i don't know what i'd do if i lost it
well the honeymoon ended and life began
"jobs and bills, losing touch with friends"
and that apartment got smaller everyday
then one night the walls finally closed in
"i came home late, she said where have you been"
you used to call and tell me you're on your way
she said if this is how its gonna be then i quit
"she walked out the door, i lost it..."
i picked myself up off the floor
she walked back through the door
we made love like it was the first time
oh if i lost it (if i lost it)
well you walked into my heart like it was some old dance hall floor
i should have known better i had seen your kind before
you rolled in like a tumble weed the texas wind had blown
and i feel another heartache coming on
theres no doubt about it darlin you're the hurtin kind
like all those other memories branded on my mind
i fell right into this one you were coming on so strong
and i feel another heartache comin on
well its a shame you couldnt keep those promises you made to me
tellin me you would never do me wrong
another lesson i will learn
you're just another heartache comin on
well i guess i'll learn the hard way darlin love is just a curse
theres no sense in crying it will only make it worse
so we'll go on our seperate ways and i'll be fine alone
until i feel another heartache comin on
until another heartache comes along
i've never been the kind that you'd call lucky
always stumbling' around in circles
but i must have stumbled into something
look at me
am i really alone with you
i wake up feeling like my life's worth living
can't recall when i last felt that way
guess it must be all this love you're giving
never knew never knew it could be like this
but i guess
some hearts
they just get all the right breaks
some hearts have the stars on their side
"some hearts,"
they just have it so easy
some hearts just get lucky sometimes
"some hearts just get lucky, lucky sometimes"
now who'd have thought someone like you could love me
you're the last thing my heart expected
who'd have thought i'd ever find somebody
someone who someone who makes me feel like this
well i guess
some hearts
they just get all the right breaks
some hearts have the stars on their side
"some hearts,"
they just have it so easy
some hearts just get lucky sometimes
some hearts just get lucky sometimes
even hearts like mine
"get lucky, lucky sometimes"
some hearts
they just get all the right breaks
"some hearts have the stars on their side, yes"
"some hearts,"
they just have it so easy
some hearts just get lucky sometimes
"some hearts just get lucky,"
"some hearts just get lucky, lucky sometimes"

sweeter than honey as soft as a sigh gentle as snowflakes but warm as july
this is the way i remember your kiss if i live forever i'll never forget
misty as morning as blue as the sky reflections of heaven in your loving eyes
eyes that said more than your words ever did and if i live forever i'll never
forget
if i live forever i'll never forget it's you that i wanted to share my life with
do i still love you the answer is yes if i live forever i'll never forget
two loving arms that i felt welcome in arms that i'd run to again and again
how do you erase sweet mem'ries you miss if i live forever i'll never forget
sad circumstances that stood between us wouldn't let us share a precious sweet
love
do you remember do you feel like this if i live forever i'll never forget
if i live forever...
do you remember do you feel like this if i live forever i'll never forget

well my first love was a little corvette
all done up in lipstick red
i thought it'd last forever 'til the motor blew
well i guess i didn't look close enough
it's a little bit just like falling in love
"looks don't mean a thing, if the heart ain't true"
"it might be a cool ride, smooth lines,"
something been custom made out in hollywood
but when you get done gazing at he outside
you better start checking out the inside
"if you want a love built to last, you better look real good"
and see what's under the hood
sporty little model standing by the door
so i took her for a spin on the old dance floor
headlights shining bright but nobody home
now i need something that's more my speed
got a whole lotta time to find what i need
so i put her in park and headed on off for home
"it might be a cool ride, smooth lines,"
something been custom made out in hollywood
but when you get done gazing at he outside
you better start checking out the inside
"if you want a love built to last, you better look real good"
and see what's under the hood
"it might be a cool ride, smooth lines,"
something been custom made out in hollywood
but when you get done gazing at he outside
you better start checking out the inside
"if you want a love built to last, you better look real good"

"you better look real good, and see what's under the hood"
love is like a butterfly
as soft and gentle as a sigh
the multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
love makes your heart feel strange inside
it flutters like soft wings in flight
"love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing"
i feel it when you're with me
it happens when you kiss me
that rare and gentle feeling that i feel inside
your touch is soft and gentle
your kiss is warm and tender
whenever i am with you i think of butterflies
love is like a butterfly
the multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
love makes your heart feel strange inside
it flutters like soft wings in flight
"love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing"
your laughter brings me sunshine
everyday is spring time
and i am only happy when you are by my side
how precious is this love we share
"how very precious, sweet and rare"
together we belong like daffodils and butterflies
love is like a butterfly
as soft and gentle as a sigh
the multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
love makes your heart feel strange inside
it flutters like soft wings in flight
"love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing"
"love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing"
"girl, you're my sunshine,"
"chase away the raindrops,"

"living in darkness,"
"then you came,"

"honey, don't change on who you are,"

and then forever
we'll walk together

every time he drinks he thinks of her
but every morning her memory fades away
"living is easy now, but it just might get worse"
cause every time he drinks he thinks of her
but in the morning he wakes up with a smile
and the road still has him coming every mile
"but the party life is dangerous, when you left your love behind"
cause it hides in every bottle that you find
every time he drinks he thinks of her
and every morning her memory fades away
"living is easy now, but it might get worse"
cause every time he drinks he thinks of her
he thinks that he can live his life without her
and leave her love as easy as it came
"if he keeps on drinkin', then his mind will keep on thinkin'"
and his heart will die rememberin' her name
every time he drinks he thinks of her
but in the morning her memory drains away
"living is easy now, but it might get worse"
cause every time he drinks he thinks of her
and every time he drinks he thinks of her
a little boy six years old
a little too used to being alone
another new mom and dad
another school another house that will never be home
when people ask him how he likes this place
he looks up and says with a smile upon his face
this is my temporary home
it?s not where i belong
windows and rooms
that i?m passing through
this is just a stop
on the way to where i?m going
i?m not afraid because i know
this is my temporary home
young mom on her own
she needs a little help got nowhere to go
"she?s looking for a job, looking for a way out"
cause the halfway house will never be a home
at night she whispers to her baby girl
someday we?ll find a place here in this world
this is our temporary home
it?s not where we belong
windows and rooms
that we?re passing through
this is just a stop
on the way to where we?re going
i?m not afraid because i know
this is our temporary home
"old man, hospital bed"
the room is filled with people he loves
and he whispers don?t cry for me
i?ll see you all someday
he looks up and says ?i can see god?s face?
this is my temporary home
it?s not where i belong
windows and rooms
that i?m passing through
this was just a stop
on the way to where i?m going
i?m not afraid because i know
this was my temporary home
this is our temporary home
is my name written there on those pages bright and fair
is my name written in the book of life
if you want to be up there then down here you must prepare
and your name must be in the book of life
get down on your knees and pray you from sin must turn away
or your name won't be in the book of life
if you'll turn to jesus now at his feet just humbly bow
then your name will be in the book of life
don't you know that christ was sent that from sin you could repent
so your name could be in the book of life
you will have a great surprise if you fell to recognize
that your name must be in the book of life
get down on your knees and pray you from sin must turn away
or your name won't be in the book of life
don't delay and don't forget that from sin you could repent
then your name will be in the book of life
is my name written in the book of life
written by buddy brock & zack turner (?)
i no longer know what's real anymore
in the back of my mind i have opened the door
that leads to the past & the love we once shared
i keep asking myself what am i doing there
what am i doing there holding you tight
taking down your hair lying close by your side
making believe that you still care
my new life is here what am i doing there
i don't get much rest with the secrets i keep
and i'm afraid that some night oh i'll talk in my sleep
how could i explain to the one lying here
she's loving me now what am i doing there
did you ever sit straight up in bed

and wait around for him to light

an never even move a hair
but when his muscles start to twitch
an when his tail begins to swish
that mule aint bothered with an itch...fly trouble
buzz buzz buzz goes that busy little pest
buzz buzz buzz that mule cant get no rest
he shakes his head an bats his eye
an kicks his heels up to the sky
did you ever see a jass ack cry

when flowers are bloomin beneath the moon
and ya light of love is shinin bright
an you tell ya self tonights the night

an on ya knees where you would propose
when somethin bights you on the nose...fly trouble
buzz buzz buzz goes that busy little thing
buzz buzz buzz you swat an loose the ring
you fan the air as he goes by
an stick ya finger in your eye
hit everything except that fly
buzz buzz buzz
don't know just how long but i've
been trapped in here quite a while
"wonder if i'll make it out, ah-ah, ah-ah"
"i miss my friends, i miss the sky"
feel like i just live to die
"but that can't be what life's about, ahh, ahh"
i think they just lock me up to taunt me (taunt me)
"i won't ever let nobody own me, own me"
i don't let these thoughts of freedom haunt me (haunt me)
what you gon' do when they learn the truth?
every time i
feel like i just can't take it no more
i get angry
that's when i start runnin'
in my mind's eye
lies the key that'll open the door
you can't break me
there's a new day comin'
that's what happens when you let a bunch of wild animals out the cage
think our biggest problem is
it all gets so monotonous
"holding us all hostages, ah-ah, ah-ah"
weighin' down on top of us
draining all our confidence
"but i won't stay anonymous, ah-ah, ah-ah"
i think they just lock me up to taunt me (taunt me)
"i won't ever let nobody own me, own me"
i don't let these thoughts of freedom haunt me (haunt me)
what you gon' do when they learn the truth?
every time i
feel like i just can't take it no more
i get angry
that's when i start runnin'
in my mind's eye
lies the key that'll open the door
you can't break me
there's a new day comin'
that's what happens when you let a bunch of wild animals out the cage
"let me out this cage, i've been here way too long, way too long (out the cage)"
"planning my escape, i see the break of dawn"
what you gon' do when they learn the truth?
every time i
feel like i just can't take it no more
i get angry
that's when i start runnin'
in my mind's eye
lies the key that'll open the door
you can't break me (you can't break me)
there's a new day comin'
every time i (oh woah)
"feel like i just can't take it no more (oh, oh)"
i get angry (i get angry)
"that's when i start runnin' (oh, oh)"
in my mind's eye (in my mind's eye)
lies the key that'll open the door
you can't break me (you can't break me)
there's a new day comin'
that's what happens when you let a bunch of wild animals out the cage
a corner dive down on the square
where the windows hang with a neon flare
regulars shoot horse and pool
while the barmaid wishes the place half full
she works the jar with a discount flirt
with a faded houston oilers shirt
while an old crow sings down on the stage
thumbing the chords on a crinkled page
he plays his zevon tune
beneath the gulf moon
take a walk down along the wall
you'll go right on past the carnival
hand in hand with the keeper kind
the kind that ties to the ties that bind
they don't care for the carnie man
or the fortune teller that reads your hand
they just beeline for a bungalow
where the curtains flutter
and candles glow in the heart of june
beneath the gulf moon
here i'm on a midnight porch
looking up at a butane torch
that hangs behind a black expanse
where the stars flicker and planets dance
it is probably time i pack it in
with a glass half-full of jameson
well i was born to croon
i might as well
beneath the gulf moon
down by the jetty near the balinese pier
the curmudgeons drink the yellow belly beer
and they bitch about the price of gas
and the fish that they can't seem to catch
they blame it on the islands way down south
from the bayou marsh and the delta mouth
where the choppers are rollin and tankers come
in the midnight daze for the oil drum
they can't leave too soon
beneath the gulf moon
everybody's talkin' bout me
i don't hear a word they're sayin'
only the echoes in my mind
everybody stops to starin'
i don't even see their faces
only the shadows of their eyes
i'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin' through the fallin' rain
going where the weather suits my clothes
bankin' off the northeast wind and sailin' on summer breeze
skippin' over the ocean like a stone
everybody's talkin' bout me
i don't hear a word they're sayin'
only the echoes of my mind
everybody stops to starin'
i don't even see their faces only the shadows of their eyes
i won't let you leave my love behind
i won't let you leave my love behind
i won't let you leave my love behind
the fisherman
are pitching pennies
in the sand
beside the sea
the sunrise hits
their oilskin boots
and their painted boats
and me
they seem
to know the ocean
like a man
knows a woman
she makes him
wait around
for half the morning
for the tide to turn
"pull on the ropes,"
seine haul fisherman
never catches more
than he knows
he can sell in a day
"pull on the ropes,"
seine haul fisherman
day's for work
night's the time
to go dancing
they're drinking beer
and laughing
and squinting at the sun
waiting for the gulls
to tell them
when the fish will come
their faces brown
and weathered
from all the nets
they've run
they've learned to wait
they always know
that the tide will turn
"pull on the ropes,"
seine haul fisherman
never catches more
than he knows
he can sell in a day;
"pull on the ropes,"
seine haul fisherman
day's for work.
night's the time
to go dancing
way out on the ocean
the big ships
hunt for whales
the japanese
have caught so many
that now
they hunt for snails
my fisherman's not greedy
he seems content to live
with the sun and the sand
and a net full of fish
when the tide turns
pull on the ropes
seine haul fisherman
never catches
more than he knows
he can sell in a day
pull on the ropes
seine haul fisherman
day's for work
night's the time
to go dancing
pull on the ropes
seine haul fisherman
never catches
more than he knows
he can sell in a day
pull on the ropes
seine haul fisherman
day's for work
night's the time
to go dancing
i don't ever think about tomorrow
whether or why is all on another day
and i think it's been said by somebody up ahead
the older guys tell me what it's all about
the older guys really got it all worked out
since we got the older guys to show us how
i don't see why we can't stop right now
it's so cold staying living down on the ocean
dead on the beach is where i want to rent my home
and i think it's been said by somebody up ahead
the older guys get the ladies with their style
the older guys squeeze 'em till it makes them smile
what's the sense of looking like a cop on the beat
what's the sense of looking like a girl on the street
i see you're doing well
"well, i'm not"
got someone new in your life
"well, i don't"
i've been busy wantin' you back
and you've been busy movin' on way too fast
guess my heart's takin' the long way out
it don't even know what to do
and seein' you with him tonight
i guess i don't break like you
"i don't drink like you do, i can't just have one"
"'cause i'm still drinkin' 'bout us, so i'll probably get drunk"
wish i could laugh and dance on a saturday night
"like you do, like goodbye ain't even crossin' your mind"
maybe you're just good at gettin' gone
or i'm just really bad at movin' on?
"i'm still in love, girl, it's true"
what can i say?
i hate that i don't break like you do
"i wish i could just smile, say hello"
"show you i'm doing fine, but i won't"
'cause i can't fake it through
"damnit, i don't break like you"
"i don't drink like you do, i can't just have one"
"'cause i'm still drinkin' 'bout us, so i'll probably get drunk"
wish i could laugh and dance on a saturday night
"like you do, like goodbye ain't even crossin' your mind"
maybe you're just good at gettin' gone
or i'm just really bad at movin' on?
"i'm still in love, girl, it's true"
what can i say?
"i hate that i don't break like you do, oh"
"i don't drink like you do, i can't just have one"
"so, i'll just sit right here, keep drinkin' 'bout us"
"i wish i could laugh, wish i could dance"
"but, baby, i just can't"
"i don't drink like you do, i can't just have one"
"'cause i'm still drinkin' 'bout us, so i'll probably get drunk"
wish i could laugh and dance on a saturday night
"like you do, like goodbye ain't even crossin' your mind"
maybe you're just good at gettin' gone
or i'm just really bad at movin' on?
"i'm still in love, girl, it's true"
what can i say?
i hate that i don't break like you do
i hate that i don't break like you do
i've been thinking it over wondering what to do
up to now i've been leaving it up to you
but you'll always be the way you've always been
i ain't got the time to go through that again
i've been wasting time and i'm to blame
living with things i couldn't change
and the one conclusion i've come to
i've been wasting time and a lot of good love on you
i've made up my mind to make my move
it's just a waste of time to wait on you
i'm set to leave and you're set in your ways
you can't change and if you can't i can't stay
i've been wasting time that i can't spare
wastin' love when you don't care
and the one conclusion i've come to
i've been wasting time and a lot of good love on you
i've been wasting time and i'm to blame...
well you can have her i don't want her she didn't loved me anyway
she only wanted someone to play with but all i wanted was a love to stay
when you're stuck with the wrong woman there ain't that much that you can do
you just dig a hole and crawl right in it then you pull the ground right over you
well you can have her...
the girl i love she upped and left me she ran away with my best friend
comes home at night for just for an hour when daylight comes she's gone again
well life without love is mighty empty but confession is good for your soul
i'd rather have love for just an hour than have the world and all of its gold
well you can have her...
now you can have her...
hallelujah (i'm ready) i'm ready (hallelujah)
i can hear the voices singing soft and low
hallelujah (i'm ready) i'm ready (hallelujah)
hallelujah i'm ready to go
in the darkness of night not a star was in site
on a highway that leads down below
but jesus came in and saved this soul from sin
hallelujah i'm ready to go
sinners don't wait before it's too late
he's a wonderful savior you know
well i fell on my knees and he answered my pleas
hallelujah i'm ready to go
in the morning you go gunning for the man who stole your water
and you fire till he is done in but they catch you at the border
and the mourners are all singing as they drag you by your feet
but the hangman isn't hanging so they put you on the street
you go back jack do it again wheels turning round and round
you go back jack do it again
when you know she's no high climber then you find your only friend
in a room with your two timer but you're sure you're near the end
then you love a little wild one and she brings you only sorrow
all the time you know she's smiling you'll be on your knees tomorrow
you go back jack do it again...
[ guitar ]
now you swear and kick and beg us that you're not a gambling man
then you find you're back in vegas with a handle in your hand
your black cards can bring you money so you hide them when you're able
in the land of milk and honey you must put them on the table
you go back jack do it again...

a tall drink of water in a cotton dress
"that preacherâ€™s daughter, she sure is blessed"
as sunlight passes through the fabric so soft
you can imagine what goes through my thoughts
she says there'll be time for all of that
when my dress is white and your suit is black
there's so many fish in the sea
and i know itâ€™s a great big world
but i couldnâ€™t help but fall in love so hard
for my dry county girl
"for my dry county girl, yeah"
itâ€™s widely known that i have my flaws
while sheâ€™s the joan of arkansas
her lips wonâ€™t touch the demon wine
but her eyes are full of pure moonshine
and i get drunk just holding her hand
i get high thinking i could be her man
for my dry county girl
"lord, i fell so hard"
for my dry county girl
"for my dry county girl, yeah"
"yeah, talking about my"

"got a feelin' cause i'm blue, oh, lord"
since my daddy said goodbye
i don't know what i'm gonna do
"all i do is sit and cry, oh, lord"
that last long day he said goodbye
"oh, lord, i thought i would die"
"he'll do ya, he'll do me, he's got that kinda lovin'"
"but, lord, i love to hear him when he calls me sweet baby"
what a beautiful dream
i hate to think it all over
i lost my heart it seems
"i've grown so used to that man, somehow"
and i'm nobody's sugar-baby now
'cause i'm lonesome
i got the lovesick blues
"now i'm in love, i'm in love with a wonderful guy"
that's what's the matter with me
"well, i'm in love, i'm in love with a wonderful guy"
but he don't care about me
"well, i tried and i tried to keep him satisfied"
but he just wouldn't stay
"but now that he is leavin', this is all i've got to say"
"i got a feelin' cause i'm blue, oh lord, since my daddy said goodbye"
i don't know what i'm gonna do
i lost my heart it seems
"i've grown so used to that man, somehow"
and i'm nobody's sugar-baby now
'cause i'm lonesome
i got the lovesick blues
"i've grown so used to that man, and how"
and i'm nobody's sugar-baby now
'cause i'm lonesome
i got the lovesick blues

i like to drink my beer
spend time with the boys
"after work, to down a few"
is something i enjoy
"and sometimes i stay out too late,"
yes i know it's true
but i love only you.
and i like to take life easy
work out in the yard
sleep late on the weekends
after an all-night game of cards
and drivin' my old chevy
on a sunday afternoon
but i love only you
i like my old guitar
and i'd like to be a star and shine on you
i'd like to write a song
the whole world could sing along about
i love only you
i like my old memories
the girls i used to know
some of them still have a place
my mind likes to go
of all the ones i've cared for
lord knows that's been a few
but i love only you
"ah, honey, i love only you."
away in a manger
no crib for a bed
the little lord jesus
lay down his sweet head
the stars in the sky
look down where lay
the little lord jesus
asleep in the hay
the cattle are lowing
the poor baby wakes
but little lord jesus
no crying he makes
i love thee lord jesus
look down from the sky
and stay by my cradle
till morning is nigh
choir sings: away in a manger
no crib for a bed
the little lord jesus
lay down his sweet head
the stars in the heavens
look down where he lay
the little lord jesus
asleep on the hay
martina sings: away in a manger
no crib for a bed
the little lord jesus
lay down his sweet head
i love thee lord jesus
look down from the sky
and stay by my cradle
till morning is nigh
stay by my cradle
sitting alone in an old rockin' chair
i saw an old mother with silvery hair
she seemed so neglected by those who should care
rocking alone in an old rockin' chair
her hands were caloused and wrinckled and old
a life full of hard work was the story they told
and i've thought of angels as i saw her there
rocking alone in an old rockin' chair
bless her old heart do you think she'd complain
though life has been bitter she'd live it again
and carry that cross that is more than her share
rocking alone in an old rockin' chair
[ piano ]
(it wouldn't take much just to gladden her heart
just some small re-embrace on somebody's heart)
a letter would brighten her empty life there
rocking alone in an old rockin' chair
i know some youngsters in an orphan's home
would think they owned heaven if she were their own
they'd never be willing till let her sit there
rocking alone in an old rockin' chair
i look at her and i think what a shame
the ones who forgot her she loves just the same
and i think of angels as i see her there
rocking alone in an old rockin' chair
rocking alone in an old rockin' chair
there a roadhouse just outside of town on a two-lane blacktop
where all the folks come to hear country music play
"and every year the city's gettin' closer, lord knows it won't stop"
"and old hank the bartender gave us the bad news today, yeah he said"
this land was our land but lord now it's their land
"and we're still here, but not for long"
so let's raise a cold one and play all the old ones
'til we've sung the last country song
there's 300 acres of cotton corn and a little bit of gravel
all bought up by a builder from downtown
tomorrow when the earth starts a-shakin and the walls start to rattle
"a big bulldozer's gonna take hank's roadhouse down, so everybody sing"
"will we play \""swingin'\"" or \""he stopped loving her today\"""
it's really sad to see it end this way
'til we've sung the last country song
oh we've sung the last country song
oh we've sung the last country song
now you're lookin' at a man that's gettin' kinda mad
i've had a lots of luck but it's all be bad
no matter how i struggle and strive i'll never get out of this world alive
my fishin' pole is broke the creek is full of sand
my woman ran away with another man
no matter how i struggle abd strive i'll never get out of this world alive
a distant uncle passed away and left me quite a batch
and i was livin' high until that fatal day
a lawyer proved i wasn't born i was only hatched
everythin's again' me and it's got me down
if i jumped in the river i would probly drown
no matter how i struggle and strive i'll never get out of this world alive
[ guitar - piano ]
these shabby shoe i'm wearin' all the time is full of holes and nails
and brother if i stopped on a worn out dime
i bet a nickei i could tell if it was heads or tails
i'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow
cause nothing's ever gonna be alright no how
no matter how i struggle and strive i'll never get out of this world alive
instrumental - there are no lyrics to this song
"take me, take me to your darkest room"
close every window and bolt every door
and the very moment i heard your voice
"i'd be in darkness, darkness no more."
oh take me (take me) to your most barren desert
a thousand miles from the nearest sea
the very moment i saw your smile
it would be like heaven to me.
there's not any mountain to rugged to climb
no desert to barren to cross
some where if you could just show me a sign of love
i could bare any lose.
so take me (take me) to siberia
in the coldest weather in the wintertime
and it would be just like spring in california
as long as i knew you were mine
people always comin' up to me and askin'
"""dolly, what's your secret?"
"with all you do, your attitude"
just seems to be so good
"how do you keep it?"""
"well i'm not the dalai lama, but i'll try"
to offer up a few words of advice
"you better get to livin', givin'"
don't forget to throw in a little forgivin'
and lovin' on the way
"you better get to knowin', showin'"
a little bit more concerned about where you're goin'
just a word unto the wise
you better get to livin'
a girlfriend came to my house
started cryin' on my shoulder sunday evening
she was spinnin' such a sad tale
i could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'
so negative the words she had to say
i said if i had a violin i'd play
"i said you'd better get to livin', givin'"
be willing and forgivin'
cause all healing has to start with you
"you better stop whining, pining"
get your dreams in line
"and then just shine, design, refine"
until they come true
and you better get to livin'
"your life's a wreck, your house is mess"
and your wardrobe way outdated
all your plans just keep on falling through
"overweight and under paid, under appreciated"
"i'm no guru, but i'll tell you"
this i know is true
"you better get to livin', givin'"
a little more thought about bein'
a little more willin' to make a better way
don't sweat the small stuff
keep your chin up
just hang tough
and if it gets too rough
fall on your knees and pray
and do that everyday
then you'll get to livin'
the day we're born we start to die
don't waste one minute of this life
get to livin'
share your dreams and share your laughter
make some points for the great hereafter
better start carin'
better start sharin'
better start tryin'
better start smiling
and you better get to livin'
that little girl knows a lot about cheating
caught him red handed too many times
she knows about lying and leaving
never had someone who really walked the line
i'm gonna change that
that girl won't be lonely long
i'm gonna change that
she's gonna know where she belongs
right now she thinks her heart's just made for breakin'
but i'm gonna change that
she knows a litte too much about teardrops
cried her a mile wide river of them
all that bad luck's got her thinking she's star crossed
"always long gone, over before it even begins"
i'm gonna change that
that girl won't be lonely long
i'm gonna change that
she's gonna know where she belongs
right now she thinks her heart's just made for breakin'
but i'm gonna change that
she don't know it yet but i'm already hers for the taking
and right now she thinks her heart's just made for breakin'
i'm gonna change that
that girl won't be lonely long
i'm gonna change that
no more humming them heart break songs
honey i'm gonna change that
you're gonna know where you belong
that it's right here with me
by my side
forget about those tears you cried
honey i'm gonna change that
oh i'm gonna change that
blame it all on my roots
i showed up in boots
and ruined your black tie affair
the last one to know
the last one to show
i was the last one
you thought you'd see there
and i saw the surprise
and the fear in his eyes
when i took his glass of champagne
and i toasted you
"said, honey, we may be through"
but you'll never hear me complain
'cause i've got friends in low places
where the whiskey drowns
and the beer chases my blues away
and i'll be okay
i'm not big on social graces
think i'll slip on down to the oasis
"oh, i've got friends in low places."
"well, i guess i was wrong"
i just don't belong
"but then, i've been there before"
everything's all right
i'll just say goodnight
and i'll show myself to the door
"hey, i didn't mean"
to cause a big scene
just give me an hour and then
"well, i'll be as high"
as that ivory tower
that you're livin' in
i guess i was wrong
i just don't belong
"but then, i've been there before"
and everything is alright
i'll just say goodnight
and i'll show myself to the door
i didn't mean to cause a big scene
just wait 'til i finish this glass
then sweet little lady
i'll head back to the bar
and you can kiss my ass
"my house of memories, is all i own,"
"i live in misery, now that you're gone."
"a constant reminder, of what used to be,"
"is torturing me, in my house of memories."
"my house is a prison, where memories surround me."
there's no place to hide where you're memory won't find
me.
"my house of memories, is all i own,"
"i'm all alone, in my house of memories."

in my house of memories.
"written by susan longacre, walt aldridge, and gary baker"
there's a road that i remember leading to a special place
where the door was always open to a smiling face
there's a picture on the mantle of a boy that looks like me
"it's always the same, there's a stocking with my name"
"and a candle in the window, a flame against the night"
"there's a candle in the window, it's like god's perfect light"
it don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
just a candle in the window
maybe it's just wishful thiking i can hear the sleigh bells ring
"almost taste teh pie she's baking, it's christmas eve"
"and there's a candle in the window, a flame against the night"
"the candle in the window, it's like god's perfect light"
it don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
just a candle in the window and christmas in your heart
wherever the years may take me no matter how far i go
"there's going to be a candle burning, it's always nice to know"
it don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
just a candle in the window and christmas in your heart
if you're looking for trouble
you came to the right place
if you're looking for trouble
just look right in my face
i was born standing up
and talking back
my daddy was a green-eyed mountain jack
"because i'm evil, my middle name is misery"
"well i'm evil, so don't you mess around with me"
well i'm evil
"i'm evil, evil, evil, as can be"
so don't mess around don't mess around don't mess around with me
"i'm evil, i'm evil, evil, evil"
"so don't mess around, don't mess around with me"
i say now
"don't, boy you better not mess around with me"
yeah!

nobody saw him running from sixteenth avenue.
they never found the fingerprint or the weapon that was used.
"but someone killed country music, cut out its heart and soul."
they got away with murder down on music row.
the almighty dollar and the lust for worldwide fame
slowly killed tradition and for that someone should hang
"(oh, you tell them alan)."
"they all say not guilty, but the evidence will show"
that murder was committed down on music row.
"for the steel guitars no longer cry and fiddles barely play,"
but drums and rock 'n roll guitars are mixed right up in your
face.
old hank wouldn't have a chance on today's radio
since they committed murder down on music row.
"they thought no one would miss it, once it was dead and gone"
they said no one would buy them old drinking and cheating
songs (i'll still buy 'em)
well there ain't no justice in it and the hard facts are cold
murder's been committed down on music row.
"oh, the steel guitars no longer cry and you can't hear fiddles"
play
with drums and rock 'n roll guitars mixed right up in your face
"why, the hag, he wouldn't have a chance on today's radio"
since they committed murder down on music row
"why, they even tell the possum to pack up and go back home"
there's been an awful murder down on music row.
invisible tears in my eyes incredible pain in my heart
indestructable memories are passing in review
impossible though things may get improbable i will forget
indelible memories of sweet loveable you
you're back again so i'll let you in
altough i'm only stealing pictures from the past
those arms are not real but somehow i feel
if i'd just close my eyes then maybe it will last
invisible tears in my eyess...

"you gotta walk that lonesome valleym, and you gotta walk, walk it by yourself"

"nobody else is gonna walk it for you, you gotta walk, walk by yourself."
you gotta walk that lonesome valley. you gotta walk it by yourself

the clouds had left an early snow
a peaceful sound was calling low
"""it's time to go"""
then god reached out his tender hand
and gently pulled her home with him
and brushed away the sorrow from her soul within
and i could hear the roses sing
a bluebird softly claps its wings
the sun seemed brighter than it's ever been
and now she's dancing in the wind
with her true love again
where her heart has always been

the autumn leaves of red and gold
"i see your lips, the summer kisses"
the sun-burned hands i used to hold
since you went away the days grow long
and soon i'll hear old winter's song
but i miss you most of all my darling
when autumn leaves start to fall
darling lets turn back the years
and go back to yester day
lets pretend the time has stopped
and i didn't goaway
we had our love to make us happy
it wasn't meant to bring us tears
love like ours should never die
so darling lets turn back the years
we had our love to make us happy
it wasn't meant to bring us tears

it was a cold and dark december night
but a star still lit the sky
away in a manger you heard a baby cry
it was the cry of the son of god
a little baby boy
born in that manger to bring the world joy
so hush up little baby
you know not what you'll do
you'll bring the world peace and love
and teach them while you do
you have nothing to fear because you know
god is with you all the way
that little important baby
born on christmas day
many people soon gathered round that tiny run down barn
they knew not of what they saw
"then came three all dressed in fancy robes, silks and furs"
this was the first indication of the importance of his birth
so hush up little baby
you know not what you'll do
you'll bring the world peace and love
and teach them while you do
you have nothing to fear because you know
god will lead the way
that little important baby
born on christmas day
we expected a soldier to save us from our plight
"all dressed in shiny armor, ready for a fight"
but instead he sent a little baby boy
all filled with love happiness
to bring the world joy
so hush up little baby
you know not what you'll do
you'll bring the world peace and love
and teach them while you do
you have nothing to fear because you know
god will lead the way
that little important baby
born on christmas day

i was sittin' beside the road in blackjack county
not knowing that the sheriff paid a bounty
for men like me who didn't have a penny to their names
so he locked my leg to thirty-five pounds
of blackjack county chain
all we had to eat was bread and water
each day we had to build that road a mile and a quarter
black sneak whip would cut our backs
when some poor fool complained
but we couldn't fight back wearin' 35 pounds
of blackjack county chain
and then one night while the sheriff was a sleepin'
we all gathered round him slowly creepin'
and heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rain
when we beat him death with thirty-five pounds
of blackjack county chain
now the whip marks have all healed and i am thankful
that there's nothing but a scar round my ankle
most of all i'm glad no man will be a slave again
to a black sneak whip and thirty-five pounds
of blackjack county chain
to a black sneak whip and thirty-five pounds
of blackjack county chain
well the honky-tonks in texas were my natural second home
where you tip your hats to the ladies and the rose of san antone
i grew up on music that we called western swing
"it don't matter who's in austin,bob wills is still the king"
"lord i can still remember,the way things were back then"
"in spite of all the hard times,i'd live it all again"
to hear the texas playboys and tommy duncan sing
makes me proud to be from texas where bob wills is still the king
you can hear the grand ol' opry in nashville tennessee
"it's the home of country music,on that we all agree"
but when you cross that ol' red river hoss that just don't mean a thing
"cause' once you're down in texas,bob wills is still the king"
well if you ain't never been there then i guess you ain't been told
that you just can't live in texas unless you got a lot of soul
"it's the home of willie nelson,the home of western swing"
"he'll be the first to tell you,bob wills is still the king"
"there's a place, where the boat leaves"
from
it takes away all your big problems
you got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean
but you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from
"take one part sand, and one part sea, one part shade of a"
big palm tree
the drinks they're cold and the ladies are hot
and i know this is the place for me
so get away to where the boat leaves from
it takes away all of your big problems
you got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean
but you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from
see the problem is that you're down there
and there's a perfectly good island somewhere
where a ride that floats and don't grab your coats
you won't need them where we are going
so get away to where the boat leaves from
it takes away all of your big problems
you got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean
but you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from
pick me up
out on a boat that is huge
pick me up
i don't know how to do
pick me up
put me down
down on the sand where its cool
put me down
when i fall off my stool
put me down
i'll just sleep there til morning comes around
with sunshine and ladies and pina colodas
and bob marley songs that are playing
there's a sound in my ear that i want you to hear
soft tropical lips that are saying
get away to where the boat leaves from
it takes away all of your big problems
you got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean
but you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from
come on along and we'll go down to a place in texas called cowtown
you'll never meet a stranger there everybody knows if you're in town
they'll greet you with a smile and howdy how you all
in just a little while you'll get that texas drawl
their hats're white and boots're brown you'll just love this place called cowtown
[ guitar - steel ]
no matter where i may wander no matter where i may roam
there's a place way down yonder i'm goin' there and make it my home
come on along and we'll go down...
you'll just love this place called cowtown
he got here red and wrinkled scared and cryin'
then she took him up and held him to her breast
and he sure was glad to get what mama offered
then he went to sleep and put his fears to rest
it didn't seem to matter what he needed
he could always count on mama to supply
and regardless of the sleep she might be losin'
he always found a twinkle in her eye
there ought to be a hall of fame for mamas
creation's most unique and precious pearls
and heaven help us always to remember
that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
she taught him all the attributes of greatness
that she knew he couldn't learn away from home
and by the time she wore the cover off her bible
her hair was gray and her little man was gone
there ought to be a hall of fame for mamas
creation's most unique and precious pearls
and heaven help us always to remember
that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
"yes, the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world"
although the years have changed now
and we go by different names
i remember the sound
of our roof in the rain
and my mind goes back in time
to a place so far gone
where the love we left behind us was still new
we were listening to a record
on the end of your bed
not giving thought to where it was all going
and i wished right then and there so badly
i could read your mind
just so i could know the things that you were knowing
"i believe, yes i do"
the hardest part is always
leaving love behind
"i believe, yes i do"
that everything we lose
will be a gift in time
but the hardest part is leaving love behind
when it was time to say goodbye
those words came down like stones
i admit for so long after
it was hard to feel at home
we'd hear the highway song
shifting down in the night
i was grateful that the echoes broke the quiet
"i believe, yes i do"
the hardest part is always
leaving love behind
"i believe, yes i do"
that everything we lose
will be a gift in time
but the hardest part is leaving love behind
the sun fades is on me now
and i miss you like words can't know
and i missed my shot at dying young a long time ago
it's just a lesson learned in love
"it's not angry, it's not sad"
sometimes you gotta lose something
to know what you have
"i believe (i believe) , yes i do"
the hardest part is always
leaving love behind
"i believe (i believe) , yes i do"
"oh, that everything we lose"
will be a gift in time
"i believe (i believe) , yes i do"
the hardest part is leaving love behind

looks like everybody's here
had to put some folding chairs in the vestibule
"yeah, it's getting full"
even old aunt ruby came
"her first time on an aeroplain, it's her sister's girl"
she said she wouldn't miss it for the world
and all them young'uns squirmin' in the pews
mr. charlie in his lime green suit is a handsome man
remarks widow callahan
uncle joe and uncle jake
haven't spoken since '88
just said hello
it's a good day to let it go
"so let the angels gather, let the music play"
let the preacher get to preachin' all the do you takes
love is a beautiful thing
throw the rice in the air let the church bells ring
tie the cans to the back of that limosine
(two people in) love is a beautiful thing
daddy's waitin' with the bride
as she helps him with his tie she sees a tear
he says it's hot in here
he hugs his little girl and asks
"how did you grow up so fast, god i wish"
your momma could be here for this
everybody stands and smiles
as she comes walking down the aisle in her momma's gown
and daddy breaks on down
gran and gramps in the second row
stood right there fifty years ago and said their vows
i guess it's workin' out
"so let the angels gather, let the music play"
let the preacher get to preachin' all the do you takes
love is a beautiful thing
throw the rice in the air let the church bells ring
tie the cans to the back of that limosine
(two people in) love is a beautiful thing
a little table full of gifts
catering is coverdish and the wedding band
well that's on her hand
tommy's teasing lorali
pushed her down and made her cry
and neither one knows a day will come
"when the angels gather, and the music play"
the preacher get to preachin' all the do you takes
love is a beautiful thing
throw the rice in the air let the church bells ring
tie the cans to the back of that limosine
"love, two people in love"
it's a beautiful thing
"love, it's a beautiful thing"
"(love, it's a beautiful thing)"
"love, oh sweet love, it's a beautiful thing"
"(love, it's a beautiful thing)"
"love, oh love, it's a beautiful thing"

frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
with a corn cop pipe and a button nose
and two eyes made out of coal
frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
he was made out of snow
but the children know how he came to life one day
there must of been some magic in
that ol' silk cap they found
for when they placed it on his head
he began to dance around
frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
and the children say he could laugh and play
just the same as you and me
frosty the snowman knew the snow was hot that day
so he said lets run and have some fun before i melt away
down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
runnin' here and there all around the square
sayin' catch me if you can
he led them down the streets of town
right to the traffic cop
and he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop
frosty the snowman
had to hurry on his way
but he waved goodbye sayin' please don't cry
i'll be back again some day

i've got your picture
that you gave to me
and it's signed with love
just like it used to be
the only thing different
the only thing new
i've got your picture
she's got you
i've got the records
that we used to share
and they still sound the same
as when you were here
the only thing different
the only thing new
i've got the records
she's got you
i've got your memory
"or, has it got me"
i really don't know
"but i know, it won't let me be"
i've got your class ring
that proved you cared
and it still looks the same
"as when you gave it, dear"
the only thing different
the only thing new
i've got these little things
she's got you

for years we both have lived on pride dear and we agree that love is gone
why oh why do we keep trying a house without love is not a home
the love light in your eyes has faded and i'm contented just to roam
we slaved to gain a worthless treasure a house without love is not a home
[ fiddle - steel ]
no matter where our footsteps wander i know we'll both be all alone
with the pride that came between us a house without love is not a home
the simple things have gone forever we wasted wealth to call our own
now we've reached the hour of parting a house without love is not a home

or get you fire from work
and since the day i left milwaukee
lynchburg and bordeaux france

i got blamed at your wedding reception
for your best man's embarrassing speech
and also for those
naked pictures of you at the beach
i've influenced kings and world leaders
i helped hemmingway write like he did
and i'll bet you a drink or two that i can make you
put that lampshade on your head
'cause since the day i left milwaukee
lynchburg and bordeaux france

and helping white people dance
i'm medicine and i am poison
i can help you up or make you fall
you had some of the best times

"monday morning, another workin' week ahead"
friday seems so far away
"the clock keeps ringin', i gotta get up out of bed"
maybe this could be the day
"motivation, well it keeps you holdin' on"
every step of the way
headin' in the right direction when you think you're turnin' wrong
lookin' out for when you stray
so hear what i say
"there's no other way, you gotta"
hold onto your dreams
'cause someday baby
"your ship is gonna come in, so"
hold onto your dreams
'cause everything ya see
comes true if you believe in holdin'
on to your dreams
well i know sometimes it's hard to see the light
shinin' at the tunnel's end
and though the road just goes on and on for miles
faith lives just around the bend
"so now and then, remember"
hold onto your dreams
'cause someday baby
"your ship is gonna come in, so"
hold onto your dreams
and everything ya see
comes true if you believe in holdin'
on to your dreams
just like your eyes are the window to the soul
dreams are the highway that lead to your goal
"hold on, hold on"
you've got to hold on
hold on
"(oh, you just got to hold on)"
hold onto your dreams
'cause someday baby

"can't leave it up to him, he's knocking on my door"
"and i knew all of my life, that someday it would end"
"get up and go outside, don't let the old man in"
many moons i have lived
my body's weathered and worn
ask yourself how would you be
if you didn't know the day you were born
try to love on your wife
and stay close to your friends
toast each sundown with wine
don't let the old man in
many moons i have lived
my body's weathered and worn
ask yourself how would you be
if you didn't know the day you were born
when he rides up on his horse
and you feel that cold bitter wind
look out your window and smile
don't let the old man in
look out your window and smile
don't let the old man in

back when i was young
couldn't wait to grow up
get away and get out on my own
and looking back now
ain't it funny how
"i've been trying to get back home, yeah"
when my low self esteem
needs a man loving me
and i find me a perfect catch
then i see my friends
having wild weekends
then i don't wanna get quite so attached
just as soon as i get what i want
i get unsatisfied
good is good but could be better
"i keep looking, i keep looking for"
i keep looking for something more
i always wonder what's on the other side
of the number two door
i keep looking
looking for something more
"well, the straight haired girls"
they all want curls
and the brunettes wanna be blonde
it's your typical thing
you got ying you want yang
it just goes on and on
"they say, hey, it's only human"
to never be satisfied
well i guess that i'm as human as the next one
"oh, i keep looking"
i keep looking for
i keep looking for something more
i always wonder what's on the other side
of the number two door
"yeah, i keep looking"
looking for something more
just as soon as i get what i want
i get unsatisfied
"hey, good is good but could be better"
i keep looking
i keep looking for
i keep looking for something more
i always wonder what's on the other side
of the number two door
i keep looking
looking for something more

don't have to leave this town to see the world
'cause it's something that i gotta do
i don't wanna look back in 30 years
and wonder who you're married to
"wanna say it now, wanna make it clear"
for only you and god to hear
"when you love someone, they say you set 'em free"
but that ain't gonna work for me
i don't wanna live without you
i don't wanna even breathe
i don't wanna dream about you
wanna wake up with you next to me
i don't wanna go down any other road now
i don't wanna love nobody but you
"lookin' in your eyes now, if i had to die now"
i don't wanna love nobody but you
you
"all the wasted days, all the wasted nights"
i blame it all on being young
got no regrets 'cause it got me here
but i don't wanna waste another one
i been thinkin' about what i want in my life
it begins and ends the same
if i had to choose what i couldn't lose
there'd only be one thing
i don't wanna live without you
i don't wanna even breathe
i don't wanna dream about you
wanna wake up with you next to me
i don't wanna go down any other road now
i don't wanna love nobody but you
"lookin' in your eyes now, if i had to die now"
i don't wanna love nobody but you
you
i don't wanna love nobody but you (you)
"wanna say it now, wanna make it clear"
for only you and god to hear
i don't wanna live without you
i don't wanna even breathe
i don't wanna dream about you
wanna wake up with you next to me (next to me)
i don't wanna go down any other road now
i don't wanna love nobody but you
(i don't wanna love nobody)
"lookin' in your eyes now, if i had to die now"
i don't wanna love nobody but you
you
i don't wanna love nobody but you (you)
i don't wanna love nobody but you
"everytime i, think about you"
i get chills along my spine
it's a feeling i'm not used to
can't believe you're really mine
"other loves, so complicated"
broken hearts and twisted minds
then you came and i'm elated
so unlike the other times
it's so pure it's almost sacred
simply put it feels divine
i just love you pure and simple
pure and simple and sublime
don't it seem we spend a lifetime
looking for that perfect love?
like a dream we finally we found it
pure and simple
"well, good for us"
it's so pure it's almost sacred
simply put it feels divine
i just love you pure and simple
"pure and simple, sweet and fine"
[outro]
i just love you pure and simple
can't believe you're really mine
yesterday i use to hide the feeling deep inside
never let nobody look
but for you my life's an open book
tonight my heart is questioning
as the moment comes
something very special here
butterflies have already begun.
could it be love i found tonight
"never believe it, that it might yes it might"
"i can't remember ever, having it feel so right"
could it be love i found tonight?
you filled my life with tenderness
encouragement as well
you helped bring out the best in me
you slowly helped me crawl out of my shell
you are so beautiful
have given me today something really wonderful
something that may never go away.
could it be love i found tonight
"never believe it, that it might yes it might"
"i can't remember ever, having it feel so right"
could it be love i found tonight?
"can i be alone with you, passions from today are burning"
no words can quite explain this glorious pain.
could it be love i found tonight
"never believe it, that it might yes it might"
"i can't remember ever, having it feel so right"
could it be love i found tonight?
there's a boy a little boy shooting arrows in the blue
and he's aiming them at someone but the question is at who
is it me or is it you it's hard to tell until you're hit
but you'll know it when they hit you cause they hurt a little bit
here they come pouring out of the blue little arrows for me and for you
you're falling in love again falling in love again
little arrows in your clothing little arrows in your hair
when you're in love you'll find those little arrows everywhere
little arrows that will hit you once and hit you once again
little arrows that hit everybody every now and then wow oh oh the pain
some folk a run and others hide but there is nothing they can do
and some folk put on amour but the arrows go straight through
so you see there's no escape so why not face it and admit
that you love those little arrows when they hurt a little bit
here they come pouring out...
here they come pouring out...
i made it through my rock and roll years
with a spent dream and
a few dollar bills
i don't know what i learned
i don't know what i know
and if i don't now i never will
i ain't seen it all but it's plain to see
i just might be an endangered species
like an old gray fox i know how he feels
with the new hats snapping at my heels
i ain't sure what it's all about
i ain't in but don't count me out
they all like to dance but if you want to dance with me
you might be dancing with an endangered species
i wasted some time
with some women i found
at no time ever settlin' down
with one over here and one over there
and that's where-nobody cares
but a man in love is what i want to be
i guess-that makes me an endangered species
"shes so kissable, huggable, loveable, unbelivable"
she all full of everything and everything a man could want
she aint typical
shes unpredictable
shes available
its a miracle!
"now my heart stumbled into someone so kissable, huggable,"
"loveable,"
unbelievable
up till now my life has been so lonely (and boring)
never thought i would find someone so
elegant
intelligent
heaven sent
all my money spent
i put a big down payment on the itty bitty diamond ring
shes so beautiful
its undisputable
its undeniable
shes gotta haveable
shes music to my ears that makes me heart sing
"so kissable, huggable, loveable,"
unbelievable

"dirt, dirt, good ol' dirt"

you can put it in water and make mud pies
"babies will eat it, but babies are dumb"
they wet their diapers and suck on their thumbs
it don't cost a thing 'cause it's everywhere
you can take it back home and nobody cares
you can throw it and kick and it don't even hurt
so a kid's best friend just got to be dirt
i love good ol' dirt

"kicks off the covers, and thinks about last night's dream"
"shower and coffee, she heads for the train"
thinkin' how every day's the same
there's gotta be more than a life on her own
all that she wants is a man to come home to
she's lookin' for someone to love her
and stay forever true
just somebody who she can believe in
and say they need her too
she's lookin' for someone to hold her
until the light of day
somebody she can make future plans with
and know he's here to stay
late in the evening she is dreamin' in black and white
an old love story she wishes portrayed her life
no one would know what goes on in her mind
thinkin' it's only a matter of time
til' someday she finds what she's lookin' for
and her ship'll come sailin' into her shore
"she's lookin' for someone to love her (oh, someone to love her)"
"and stay forever true (oh, no)"
just somebody who she can believe in
and say they need her too (someone who needs her too)

"until the light of day (oh, until the light of day)"

i can see an angel walking
someone else is by his side
i can hear an angel talking
and he looks so satisfied
i can see an angel smiling
by his side i'll never be
in my heart i'll go on crying
only tears are left for me
time will change many things
new seasons will come and go
but i will never change
all my life i'll love him so
i can see an angel laughing
he's the one that i adore
i will always keep on hiding
all my love forever more
time will change many things
new seasons will come and go
but i will never change
all my life i'll love him so
i can see an angel laughing
he's the one that i adore
i will always keep on hiding
all my love forever more

i was just a teenage boy on my way to school
mama made a meal for me as i turned on the news
the details still weren't certain as i put on my shoes
i wasn't sure what happened but i knew i had the blues.
cause that's the day the freebird fell
"oh, i remember it well"
so many cried when ronnie died
and never said farewell
what he'd say in a southern song
stories told still live on
oh the day the freebird fell.
i pulled myself together and i went on my way
i missed the bus on purpose so i could walk that day
tuesday's gone and simple man kept playin in my mind
"sweet home alabama, curtis lowe and one more time"
'cause that's the day the freebird fell
"oh, i remember it well"
so many cried when ronnie died
and never said farewell
what he'd say in a southern song
stories told still live on
oh the day the freebird fell
"many years have come and gone, a lot of things has changed"
father time has passed me by but one thing stayed the same
"when i'm feeling lonely, when i'm feeling blue"
i crank up some of that good ole honk and lord i think of you.
back to the day the freebird fell
"oh, i remember it well"
so many cried when ronnie died
and never said farewell
what he'd say in a southern song
stories told still live on
oh the day the freebird fell.
"gimme three steps, you got that right"
oooo that smell
a simple man was comin' home
the day the freebird fell.
i was just a teenage boy on my way to school...

looks like your cup's empty
and you're all alone
i got the good stuff with me
can you hear that song?
"it just came on, girl"
i can tell that you're feelin' it
i see the words runnin off your lips
and you're crazy cool
"same night, same spot"
don't it look like 've got some good timing?
just a boy and a girl underneath these stars shining
it feels like it was meant to be yea
"no, i don't think it's coincidence"
running into you here like this
"sparks flying, see you smiling"
baby ain't it crazy? we got good timing
look up to that sky girl
it's a full moon night
you just broke up with somebody
baby so did i
"just the other night, girl"
can you believe what time it is?
"11: 11, let's make a wish"
we're gonna have a night we'll never forget
and it ain't over yet
girl we got some good timing
just a boy and a girl underneath these stars shining
it feels like it was meant to be yea
"no, i don't think it's coincidence"
running into you here like this
"sparks flying, see you smiling"
baby ain't it crazy? we got good timing
"it used to be the only luck i had was a day late dollar short, always bad"
and then i saw your face and it all changed up
baby just like that
it's alright
"right on the money, on the spot"
girl we got some good timing
just a boy and a girl underneath these stars shining
it feels like it was meant to be yea
"no, i don't think it's coincidence"
running into you here like this
"sparks flying, see you smiling"
baby ain't it crazy? we got good timing
good timing
good timing

there's a tear in my beer
"'cause i'm cryin' for you,"
dear you are on my lonely mind.
into these last nine beers
i have shed a million tears.
you are on my lonely mind
i'm gonna keep on sittin' here
until i'm petriified.
and then maybe these tears
will leave my eyes.
there's a tear in my beer
"'cause i'm crying' for you, dear"
you are on my lonely mind.
2:
last night i walked the floor
and the night before
you are on my lonely mind.
it seems my life is through
and i'm so doggone blue
you are on my lonely mind.
i'm gonna keep on sittin' here
till i can't move a toe
and then maybe my heart
won't hurt me so.
there's a tear in my beer
"'cause i'm cryin' for you, dear."
you are on my lonely mind.

"lord, i've tried and i've tried"
but my tears i can't hide
you are (were?) on my lonely mind.
all these blues that i've found
have really got me down
you are on my lonely mind
i'm gonna keep on drinkin' till i can't even think
cause in the last week i ain't slept a wink
there's a tear in my beer
"""cause i'm crying for you dear"
you are on my lonely mind.
if you listen a story i'll tell you of a girl who once lived in this land
a girl who once was my sweetheart she was known as the blue velvet band
on her cheeks was the first flush of nature her beauty it seemed to expand
her hair hung down in long tresses tied back with a blue velvet band
i can still see those tears as we parted of my heart broken blue velvet band
as i left her i told her i'll never come back to my home again
five years in the wide open spaces was all that my poor heart could stand
every night as i lay on my pillow i would dream of my blue velvet band
then one night as i lay down dreaming of home and poor mother and dad
like a flash by my bedside was standing the form of my blue velvet band
i started next day for my darling just to go back and make her my bride
but as i reached the old country depot they told me my sweetheart had died
they laid her to rest in the churchyard midst the sweet summer flowers of the land
on her finger was the ring i had bought her on her head was a blue velvet band
traded in my old toyota
and i moved outta that shoebox apartment
i been wearing brand new clothes
"even changed the number on my phone, mm"
different bars and different streets
"different drinks, different lips"
different parts of town
a different friday crowd
there's different songs on the radio
who am i kidding?
everything's different now
everything
but the same heart that loves you's still beating
"in this chest heart, no matter how far i think i've moved on"
"there's always gonna be us, girl"
"'cause i still got the, i still got the"
"the same heart, ooh"
"mm, mm"
ooh
i been going different ways to get to work
'cause if i got down 12th it still hurts when i pass that corner light
when your laughter in the wanderlust comes flooding back and fills up my car
and i realize that a piece of me will always wonder where you are
the same heart that loves you's still beating
"in this chest heart, no matter how far i think i've moved on"
"there's always gonna be us, girl"
"'cause i still got the, i still got the"
"the same heart, ooh"
"ooh, ooh"
ooh
but i still got the same heart
"ooh, ooh"
same heart
ooh
i can say that i'm fine but i'd be lying
it's so hard to move on but i keep trying
"every breath that i take, it's reminding me"
i can say that i'm fine but i'd be lying
it's so hard to move on but i keep trying
it's so hard to move on but i keep trying
"i'm lying, i still got"
the same heart that loves you's still beating
"in this chest heart, no matter how far i think i've moved on"
"there's always gonna be us, girl"
"'cause i still got the, i still got the"
"the same heart, ooh"
"oh, oh, oh"
"i still got the, i still got the"
"the same heart, ooh"
"ooh, ooh"
"i still got the, i still got the"
well hello there my it's been a long long time
how am i doin' oh i guess that i'm doin' fine
it's been so long now but it seems now it was only yesterday
gee ain't it funny how time slips away
how's your new love i hope that he's doin' fine
i heard you told him that you'd love him till the end of time
now that's the same thing that you told me seems like just the other day
gee ain't it funny how time slips away
i gotta go now i guess i'll see you around
don't know when though never know when i'll be back in town
but remember what i tell you in time you're gonna pay
and it's surprising how time slips away
all day long i worry all night i'm blue
i feel so awfully lonesome i don't know what to do
and so i ask you doctor to see if you can find
something in your sachet to pacify my mind
oh doctor doctor write me a prescription for the blues
latly tell you doctor why i'm in misery
once i had a lover he went away from me
i went to see the ejection and the voodoo doctors too
they shook their heads and told there was nothing they could do
oh doctor doctor why not write me a prescription for the blues
just like a little baby all night night i cry
now doctor if you can't cure me why i just as soon to die
so give me something poison doctor won't you please
and then i'll sign a peper sayin' i die with heart disease
oh doctor doctor write me a prescription for the blues
"i was blue, just as blue as i could be"
ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
then good luck came a-knocking at my door
skies were gray but they're not gray anymore
blue skies
smiling at me
nothing but blue skies
do i see
bluebirds
singing a song
nothing but bluebirds
all day long
never saw the sun shining so bright
never saw things going so right
noticing the days hurrying by
"when you're in love, my how they fly"
blue days
all of them gone
nothing but blue skies
from now on
i should care if the wind blows east or west
i should fret if the worst looks like the best
i should mind if they say it can't be true
"i should smile, that's exactly what i do"
i watched him take your heart and walk away
and leave you wondering what mistake you made
and i'd never try to take his place
i guess there's really nothin' i can say
but i can be that whiskey in your bottle
i can be that smile that takes away your tears
i can be the place you just want to run to
i can be that somethin' to get you through
love can build you up and shut you down
fill your heart with joy or make it drown
i don't know if i can help you see
it makes you blind sometimes to what you need
but i can be that whiskey in your bottle
i can be that smile that takes away your tears
i can be that place you just want to run to
i can be that somethin' to get you through
"yeah, i can be that whiskey in your bottle"
i can be that smile that takes away your tears
i can be that place you just want to run to
i can be that somethin' to get you through
i wanna be that somethin' to get you through
bobby wants a puppy dog for christmas
i know you plan to bring electric trains
bobby wants a puppy dog for christmas
that's the only song we hear him sing
"santa, please remember bobby's lonely"
the closest neighbour's farm is quite a ways
and the country school don't have no children bobby's size
and i'd like to give him something he can raise
and bobby wants a puppy dog for christmas
i know you plan to bring electric trains
"but, bobby wants a puppy dog for christmas"
and that's the only song we hear him sing
butch and susie won't be here for christmas
and he won't see his cousins now till spring
if we can find a playmate he can play with
"santa, that'll be all you have to bring"
and bobby wants a puppy dog for christmas
i know you plan to bring electric trains
"but, bobby wants a puppy dog for christmas"
that's the only song we hear him sing
"well, i don't know what my uncle did"
but he must have done it right
they sure strung him up one saturday night
he had spent his whole life fussin'
would have spent his last breath cussin'
'til he realized the deal was really done
"he started screamin' ""hallelujah!"""
tryin' to make his peace with everyone
"yeah, he was kickin' and screamin'"
just like he came in
"he was kickin' and screamin', darlin'"
right to the bitter end
ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddy-up
and go out hollerin' whoa
"lord, we never want to be here"
sure don't ever want to go.
"well, i could hear those church bells ringin'"
to my best friend i was clingin'
"screamin' ""if you love me brother don't let me go"""
well then the whole scene was repeated
two years later i begged and pleaded
"screamin' ""if you love me, honey,"
"now you know you wouldn't want to let me go"""
"no, i didn't want to do it"
but i sure don't want to see it come undone.
"yeah, i was kickin' and screamin'"
just like i came in
"i was kickin' and screamin', darlin'"
right to the bitter end
ain't it funny how we come in kickin' giddyup
and go out hollerin' whoa
"lord, we never want to be here"
sure don't ever want to go.
"(troy seals, eddie setser, larry stewart)"
remember when i said the next time would be the last time
that time came this mornin' when you came in
you always had a line to change my mind
so i guess you thought i'd just let you break my heart again
i don't want to stop lovin' youâ€¦but i will
i don't like wakin' up aloneâ€¦but i will
you're the only one who can make my heart stand still
i don't want to let you goâ€¦but i will
i could write a book on the innocent looks you're giving me
you've got one for every story you tell
i've seen it all and i'm not gonna fall
for those make believe tears
"so, darlin' i will try to make it clear"
i don't want to stop lovin' youâ€¦but i will
i don't like wakin' up aloneâ€¦but i will
you're the only one who can make my heart stand still
i don't want to let you goâ€¦but i will
you're the only one who can make my heart stand still
i don't want to let you goâ€¦but i will
you ask me how i'm doin'
"since we've gone, our seperate ways"
"i wish i could say, there's someone new"
but i still think about you night and day
and i wish that i was lyin'
"and that's the truth,"
i wish i was lyin'
i wish i was lyin'
i wish i was lyin' next to you
"i'll meet someone, and tell her i'll call,"
though i know i'm not goin' to
"close as she comes to bein' perfect,"
"she can't help it, she's not you"
and i wish that i was lyin'
"and that's the truth,"
i wish i was lyin'
i wish i was lyin'
i wish i was lyin' next to you
i know i should get on with my life
but that's impossible to do
a lifetime just ain't long enough
to get over someone like you
and i wish that i was lyin'
"and that's the truth,"
i wish i was lyin'
i wish i was lyin'
i wish i was lyin' next to you

got my eye on a boy
he's eyeing me back
it's looking real good
this could be it
and i know that all of you girls
would love to steal him away
he bought me a drink
i thanked him real sweet
it's always so nice when you first meet
and i know that all of you women would love to steal him away
so i'm warning you
better keep your hands off my
better keep your hands off my
better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
building up an appetite
you can look but you can't buy
better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend

comin' on so strong
he's twisting my ignition key
turn my motor on
"but anyone can see, all his attention's on me"
give us some privacy
better keep your hands off my

he's all yours
until then
better keep your hands off my
better keep your hands off my
better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
feel you crowdin' in on me
hovering suspiciously
better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
(billy ray cyrus/don von tress)
"well, it seems you thought it over"
and you feel i'm not the one
and you think you might do better on your own.
you say lover's vows only hold you down
"so i guess i'm moving on,"
"but what'll you think about me when i'm gone, said and done?"
"what will you think about me when i'm gone, said and done,"
when old memories fall like footsteps.
will you think it's me coming home?
"well, i thought your eyes could see compromise,"
but that's one thing you've never done.
what'll you think about me when i'm gone?
will some other's kiss taste sweeter
or will my pictures haunt your room?
will it make your nights pass easier
or will you think you were a fool
"when my pillow's bare and you're lying there,"
will a heartache linger on?
what'll you think about me when i'm gone?
what'll you think about me when i'm gone?
e
i was so ugly the doctor slapped my momma when i was born
then he took out his pocket knife and cut off my horns
he said lady if you ain't already picked out a name
go ahead on and call him trouble man
b a
"he's gonna be wild,i'm giving you warning"
g b e
"he's gotta have room,keep an eye on him"
e
i grew up with long and lean and hungry looks
i learned you can't go nowhere when you go by the book
"people all around me earthbound,i learned how to fly"
"upside,downside,ouside,sailing on by"
b a
"out of my reach,out of my hands"
g b e
"out of control,trouble man"
e
i've been so far in all directions as you can get
i ain't never had enough of anything yet
i had women that tore me apart without any reason
i say baby i don't get mad i just get even
b a
i don't explain if you don't understand
g b e
"i'm my own man,trouble man"
trouble man
(billy ray cyrus/don von tress)
mama used to tell me tales
'bout a part of town
where people cry the blues
most everyday
she said don't go down there boy.
"you know, love will cut you down"
"and you ain't yet a man, hear what i say"
"she said listen to me, son, it's so"
"let me tell ya, i've been down there"
and i know
that on love street they've got signs
that say watch for falling victims
dreams get run down in the night
lord and yours might be the next one
down where lies'll cut you deep
and goodbyes are loaded guns
you can take one through the heart
another casualty of love
but still i had to find out
just how a love would feel
i got tangled in the arms
of one gone bad
now i sit and wait and wonder
as i cry myself to sleep
why i couldn't heed what my mama said
new her every word rings clear and true
now i've come to realize what love can do
and why love street still got signs....
"good mornin', mornin' glory"
"good mornin', what's your story"
"good mornin', where'd you spend the night"
where did your night dreams take you
sorry but i had to wake you
"oh, i just had to make you"
shed your precious mornin' light on me
"oh, good mornin' sleepy baby"
"you know, i'm thinking maybe"
i love you even more today
every time you go to sleep
i'm jealous of the dreams
that keep you away from me
"good mornin', mornin' glory"
i'll have to thank the sandman
for he's let you wake up in my arms again
"doo doo da, doo doo doo, doo"
"oh, come on darling time to get up"
i have your breakfast table set up
it's such a lovely morning to see
and i have my mornin' glory with me
there ain't enough of me to go around
got all kinds of reasons
to be all over town
spread venom broken down
everybody wants a piece
oh darlin i'm afraid
you've been last but not least
everyone i love the most
has to take what's left of me
i put it all together
but i left out one big piece
i put you last
but you're not least
nothing ever takes the place of you
sometimes things that may not matter
jump in front of things that do
and your fine to stand in line
while history repeats
but oh darlin not this time
last but not least
everyone i love the most
they deserve the best from me
i put it all together
when i found that missing piece
you were the last
but you're not least
i go left when i should go right
i chase the dark when i see light
i trip and fall down every time i try
to walk that line
the sun comes up i look for rain
i search for joy and i find the pain
i swear i will never get again
last but not least
last but not least
everyone i love the most
is gonna see the best of me
i put it all together
when i found the missing piece
you were the last
you were the last
but you're not least
walk the llama llama
walk the llama llama
take in the panorama
walk the llama llama - llama llama
don't have to be a drama
walk the llama llama - llama llama
no one could be calmer
walk the llama llama
walk the llama llama
double l.a.m.a
fluff up your fur
stick out your chest
walk the llama llama
now your looking your best
keep out the wind
keep out the snow
wool by llama from head to toe
walk the llama llama - llama llama
take in the panorama
walk the llama llama
walk the llama llama
double l.a.m.a
cool in the summer
warm in the cold
a perfect fashion statement
for the young and the old
a cloak for the priest
a hat for the farmer
you could be looking at the emperor's pajamas
that's way the llama walks so proud
that's way the llama holds his head up in the crowd
all of us applaud his generosity
he's more than just a passing curiosity
he covers up our pride
and all those things we have to hide
in any civilized society

tonight there'll be candlelight and roses
in this little country chapel that's almost falling down
there'll be tears in this old farmer's eyes this evening
when i give my one possession to that city boy from town
his hair is a little longer than we're use to
"but, i guess i should find something good to say"
about this man whose won the farmer's daughter
and will soon become my son-in-law today
mama left eight years ago december
and it was hard to be a dad and mama too
"but, somehow we made home of this old farmhouse"
and love was all my baby ever knew
he could be the richest man in seven counties
and not be good enough to take her hand
"but, he says he really loves the farmer's daughter"
and i know the farmer's daughter loves the man
well won't you lend your lungs to me
mine are collapsing
plant my feet and bitterly breathe
up the time that's passing
and breath i'll take and breath i'll give
and pray the day's not poison
stand among the ones that live
in lonely indecision
fingers walk the darkness down
mind is on the midnight
gather up the gold you've found
you fool it's only moonlight
and if you try to take it home
your hands will turn to butter
you better leave this dream alone
try to find another
salvation sat and crossed herself
called the devil partner
wisdom burned upon a shelf
who'll kill the raging cancer
seal the river at its mouth
take the water prisoner
fill the sky with screams and cries
bathe in fiery answers
jesus was an only son
and love his only concept
strangers cry in foreign tongues
and dirty up the doorstep
and i for one and you for two
ain't got the time for outside
just keep your injured looks to you
we'll tell the world that we tried
i take off time to time
with those crazy friends of mine
head out on steel horses
with wheels and we ride
we burn up that road to mexico
blend in with the desert
just we amigos
and we roll
cowboys like us sure do have fun
"racin’ the wind, chasin’ the sun"
take the long way around back to square one
today we’re just outlaws out on the run
"there’ll be no regrets, no worries and such"
for cowboys like us
"we talk about livin’, babies, and women"
all that we’ve lost and all we’ve been givin’
"we sing about true love, lie about things we ain’t done"
"drink one more cold one, come morning’ get up"
and we roll
cowboys like us sure do have fun
"racin’ the wind, chasin’ the sun"
take the long way around back to square one
today we’re just outlaws out on the run
"there’ll be no regrets, no worries and such"
for cowboys like us
cowboys like us sure do have fun
"racin’ the wind, chasin’ the sun"
take the long way around back to square one
today we’re just outlaws out on the run
"there’ll be no regrets, no worries and such"
for cowboys like us
cowboys like us

there was a world outside my door
i wasn't in touch with anymore
there was a way i used to feel
i knew what was and wasn't real
i felt safe on shaky ground
and i was a master of despair
making believe i didn't care
i shouldn't be standing here today
after all the crazy things i've done
i'm ready to fall and that's ok
i ran as far as i could run
you won
out of a world turned upside down
it took some time to come around
out of a dream you made me whole
yes you did
you lit a fire down in my soul
i shouldn't be standing here today
after all the crazy things i've done
i'm ready to fall and that's ok
i ran as far as i could run
you won
i shouldn't be standing here today
after all the crazy things i've done
i'm ready to fall and that's ok
i ran as far as i could run
you won
and you won
i'm ready to fall
i thought i knew what i was doing
i thought i was in control
i thought nobody could slow me down
but what did i know
"i was just a kid, a motherless child"
no one to watch over me i was runnin' wild
free of all responsibility 'til my life
and my love for myself caught up with me
"yeah, it caught up with me"
"and now i'm (ready to fall), yes i am"
whooo
whooo
everytime the phone rings
my heart starts imagining
that it's you on the line
saying please me mine
i wanna give you everything
everytime the phone rings
my heart goes.....
everytime the phone rings
my mind starts picturing
angels up high
working over-time
making you and me
meant to be
oh everytime the phone rings
my mind goes
anticipation
wild imagination
wanna know more than anything
oh it could be you boy
everytime the phone rings
anticipation
wild imagination
want it more than any thing
oh it should be you boy
everytime the phone rings
my body starts tingling
i get shivers down my spine
when it's you on the line
i get a little weak in the knees
oh the phone rings
my body goes
whoo
my mind goes
my heart goes
"well, goes,,,"
everytime the phone rings
everytime the phone rings
everytime the phone rings
everytime the phone rings
"ha ha ha,it's summer night babe"
yeah...
"come on ladies,it's time to pop that top"
"and fellas,i know you're ready to rock"
we went crazy cooped up all winter long
"and school is out,so let's get it on"
flip flop tans and some white sand
i know the perfect spot
well the sunset better set soon
so we can get in the mood
things start getting all heated up
"when ir starts getting cool,yeah"
"summer nights,everybody,are you with me?"
let that igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
"summer nights,everybody's feeling sexy"
holler if you're ready for some summer nights
come on
"ohhhhh,oh yeah."
"now fellas,you better watch your step"
don't let them teeny french bikinis make you loose your breath
"back to the ladies,ya'll keep doing yall's thing"
'cause everything about you makes me wanna scream
"the sun is getting low,there it goes,here we go,here comes the moon"
yeah
things start getting all heated up
when it starts getting cool
yeah
it's a party down
probably big bar fight on the beach
it's coronas in daytona ya'll
well it's wild and it's free
"yeah,oh are you ready?"
are you ready?
are you ready?
for some summer nights
yeah baby summer nights
it's summer nights
come on
a heartsong melody play like a symphony
the sweetest music i have ever known
a song of joy and pain
the mountain angels sing
"a bittersweet refreign of my smokey mountain home, heartsong"
farmer's daughter if you will
and i often wonder still
in memories where i rammbled as a child
makes me cry and makes me laugh
my reflections on the past
"and the family, friends, and faith that shaped my life"
ragged clothes and hand-me-downs
just enough to go around
but the sweetest things in life are always free
like the songs the birds would sing
and the sweet new grass of spring
and the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree
and i recall the thrill and joy
of a smokey mountain boy
i remember my first kiss and my first love
and the songs i'd song and write
and the dreams i'd clutch so tight
and the loved ones that gave me that extra shove
and in that little house 'a prayer
where i spent many hour
prassin' god and liftin' up his name
and asking him to lead and to keep watch over me
as i headed up that rocky road to fame
"and now this, smokey mountain girl has been all around the world"
but it makes no difference just how far i roam
i still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart
my faith in god and memories of home
doing what you love has a high price to pay
"some put on a suit, but he ran the other way"
drums drown out the yuppies
and the one's who couldn't dream
cause the freedom music gave him was worth more than anything
they don't know
what they got
until it's gone
like it or not
you live on love
you try to do what's right
we're all here waiting for our silver invitation
to our big band in the sky
rollin down the windows
trying hard to fight the sleep
money's never much for a band in tennessee
another night of plain'
to a crowd with no ears
wanna hear the songs they know
and fill their bellies full of beer
but they don't know
what they got
until it's gone
like it or not
you live on love
you try to do what's right
we're all here waiting for our silver invitation
to our big band in the sky
and when he closed his eyes
fell into a dream that never dies
and when the thunder comes
you can hear his kick drum in the sky
feel the rain
fall from our eyes
cause we don't know
what we got
until it's gone
like it or not
you live on love
you try to do what's right
for him there's no more waiting
got his silver invitation
to do a little playing
for the big band in the sky
she left without leaving a number
said she needed to clear her mind
he figured she'd gone back to austin
cause she talked about it all the time
it was almost a year before she called him up
3 rings and an answering machine is what she got
"if you're calling about the car, i sold it"
if this is tuesday night i'm bowling
if you got something to sell you're wasting your time
i'm not buying
if its anybody else wait for the tone you know what to do and
p.s. if this is austin i still love you....
the telephone fell to the counter she heard
but she couldn't believe what kind of man would
hang on that long what kind of love that must be
she waited 3 days and then she tried again
she didn't know what she'd say but she heard 3 rings and then....
if its friday night i'm at the ball game
and first thing saturday if it don't rain
i'm headed out to the lake and i'll be gone
all weekend long but i'll call you back when i get home on
sunday afternoon and p.s. if this is austin i still love you
well this time she left her number but not another word
and then she waited by the phone on sunday evening
and this is what he heard
if you're calling about my heart its still yours
i should have listened to it a little more
and it wouldn't have taken me so long to know where i belong
and by the way boy this is no machine you're are talking to
can't ya tell this is austin and i still love you.
i know this dress i'm wearing doesn't hide the secret i have tried concealing
when he left he promised me that he'd be back by the time it was revealing
the sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields of clover
and time is running out for me i wish that he would hurry down from dover
he's been gone so long when he left the snow was deep upon the ground
and i have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown
and any time a tiny face will show itself cause waiting's almost over
but i won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from dover
my parents didn't understanding when they found out they sent me
from the home place
my daddy said if folks found out he would be ashamed to ever show his face
my mother said i was a fool and she did not believe me when i told her
but everything would be all right cause soon he would be coming down from dover
i loved him more than anything and i could not refuse him when he needed me
he was the only man i'd loved and i just can't believe that he was using me
he couldn't leave me here like this i know it can't be so it can't be over
he wouldn't make me go through this so long he'll be coming down from dover
my body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where i'm lying
our baby has been born but something's wrong it's much too still i hear no crying
i guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a daddy's arms to hold her
and dying was her way of telling me he wasn't coming down from dover

i can't thank you enough
for the happiness we've shared
i've never known a day that sunshine wasn't there
i can't begin to tell you the joy you bring to me
and as long as we're together
what more could there ever be?
"'cause there's power, power, power in our love"
it's so strong that it controls us everyday
"yes, there's power, power, power in our love"
and together we love living life this way
there is no challenge in this world
"that we can't meet, today"
"for i've got you beside me, hand in hand all the way"
"and when i go to sleep tonight so satisfied, within"
"i know that when the morning comes, i'll be in love again"
"'cause there's power, power, power in our love"
it's so strong that it controls us everyday
"yes, there's power, power, power in our love"
and together we love living life this way
you might wake up some morning
to the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
and if you're quick enough to rise
you'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
out on the new horizon you may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
and if the sleep has left your ears
you might hear footsteps running through an open meadow
don't be concerned it will not harm you
it's only me pursuing something i'm not sure of
across my dreams with nets of wonder i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
you might have heard my footsteps
echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
i might have even called your name as i ran searching after something to believe in you might have seen me runnin'
through the long abandonned ruins of the dreams you left behind
if you remember something there
that glided past you followed close by heavy breathing
don't be concerned it will not harm you
it's only me pursuing something i'm not sure of
across my dreams with nets of wonder i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
i chase the bright butterfly of love i chase the bright butterfly of love
bu-bu-bu-butterfly of love bu-bu-bu-butterfly of love
"jesus our brother, kind and good"
was humbly born in a stable wood
and the friendly beasts around him stood
"jesus our brother, kind and good."
"""i,"" said the donkey, shaggy and brown,"
"""i carried his mother up hill and down;"
"i carried her safely to bethlehem town."""
"""i,"" said the donkey, shaggy and brown."
"""i,"" said the cow, all white and red"
"""i gave him my manger for a bed;"
"i gave him my hay to pillow his head."""
"""i,"" said the cow, all white and red."
"""i,"" said the sheep with curly horn,"
"""i gave him my wool for his blanket warm;"
"he wore my coat on that christmas morn."""
"""i,"" said the sheep with curly horn."
"""i,"" said the dove from the rafters high,"
"""cooed him to sleep that he should not cry;"
"we cooed him to sleep, my lovw and i."""
"""i,"" said the dove from the rafters high."
"""i,"" said the camel, yellow and black,"
"""over the desert, upon my back,"
"i brought him a gift in the wise men's pack."""
"""i,"" said the camel, yellow and black."
thus every beast remembering it well
in the stable dark was so proud to tell
of the gifts that they gave emmanuel
writer jesse winchester
i'm the same old girl that i used to be
i haven't changed at all
i got the same old walk and the same old talk
that would run you up the wall
the same old face and the same old smile and
the same old baby blues
"and i'm still doing the rhumba, baby"
so i'm still the girl for you
i'm still doing the rhumba baby
i can't seem to quit
if my mama catches us doing the rhumba
mama would just pitch a fit
"but i can't help myself, it's much bigger than me"
"if i were you, i'd hang onto a rhumba girl like me"
there's lots of girls on the floor tonight
with a lot slicker steps than me
the boogaloo and the funky broadway
are such a pretty sight to see
my step might be old fashioned
but it's just fine with me
i got a couple of rhumba steps
you might like to see
i'm still doing the rhumba baby
i can't seem to quit
if my mama catches us doing the rhumba
mama would just pitch a fit
"but i can't help myself, it's much bigger than me"
"if i were you, i'd hang onto a rhumba girl like me"
maybe heâ€™s right.
maybe there is something wrong with me.
"i just donâ€™t see how a world that,"
that makes such wonderful things...could be bad.
look at this stuff. isnâ€™t it neat?
wouldnâ€™t you think my collectionâ€™s complete?
wouldnâ€™t you think iâ€™m the girl
the girl who has evâ€™rything?
"look at this trove, treasures untold"
how many wonders can one cavern hold?
"looking around here, youâ€™d think"
"sure, sheâ€™s got evâ€™rything"
iâ€™ve got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
iâ€™ve got whoâ€™s-its and whatâ€™s-its galore
you want thing-a-ma-bobs?
iâ€™ve got twenty
but who cares? no big deal
i want more
i wanna be where the people are
"i wanna see, wanna see â€˜em dancinâ€™"
walkinâ€™ around on those
"whaddya call â€˜em? oh, feet"
"flippinâ€™ your fins, you donâ€™t get too far"
"legs are required for jumpinâ€™, dancinâ€™"
stollinâ€™ along down the
whatâ€™s that word again? street
"up where they walk, up where they run"
up where they stay all day in the sun
"wanderinâ€™ free, wish i could be"
part of that world
what i would give if i could live
out of these waters
what i would pay to spend a day
warm on the sand
betcha on land they understand
bet they donâ€™t reprimand their daughters
bright young women sick of swimminâ€™
ready to stand
and ready to know what the people know
"ask â€˜em my questions, get some answers"
whatâ€™s a fire? and why does it
whatâ€™s that word? burn?
whenâ€™s it my turn?
"wouldnâ€™t i love, love to explore"
"that shore up above, out of the sea"
wish i could be
"meet me on the banks of the yangtze, suzie"
beneath the glare of the new-west yard
we’ll watch the barges cart away the waste of another day
we’ll watch the barges cart away the waste of another day
meet me in the middle of renmin park
we’ll watch the ducklings gobbling bread
and the stealth of the approaching swan
we’ll watch the ducklings gobbling bread
and the stealth of the approaching swan
listen for the song of the propane seller
bouncing off the walls
his morning cry a promise to you from me
his morning song a blessing on you and me
"meet me on the banks of the yangtze, suzie beside the gate of the new-west yard"
we’ll watch the darkness leach away into the haze of another day
we’ll watch the darkness leach away into the haze of another day
"a young couple marries, already fighting"
along comes baby makin' them three
trouble's all he hears from the time he's in didies
baby don't know just what to believe
angry words and spiteful actions
baby's gonna cut his teeth on these
if that's gonna be the main attraction
"what will the baby be, what will baby be"
baby needs love and needs direction
baby's first school is the family
for they are only a reflection
"of the things they see, what will baby be"
what will baby be after baby is grown
what will baby do if baby don't know what's right or wrong
"got to show them love, got to teach them truth"
'cause what baby is when baby grows up
"well, that depends entirely on me and you"
depends entirely on me and you
baby thinks god is just a curse word
never said a prayer 'cause he's never been taught
they remember and repeat what they've heard
so i ask who's really at fault
"so many questions, so few answers"
so many lessons we don't teach
stumbling through like clumsy dancers
"what will baby be, what will baby be"
what will baby be after baby is grown
what will baby do when baby is out there on his own
teach the children how to be all they should be
'cause what baby is when baby grows up
depends entirely on you and me
depends entirely on you and me
what will baby be
"i can hear that old clock ticking, passing time up on the wall i can hear the faucet dripin in the kicthc down the hall to the one that i keep missing every night and every day"
there's things you learn to live with now thats all but i'll never get used to living without you
"now i got used to tenderness, we would hold each other tight and i got used to happiness we'd make love day and night and i'll get used to mornings sitting in the evening swhen theres"
there's things you learn to live with now thats all i ever do but ill never get used to living without you
we've been down this road before
how many times am i gonna have to close that door?
"when you've had wine, and you're lonely"
why is that the only time you ever want me?
you can call me an ex when you hang out with friends
"you can call me on a sunday, just to ask me how i've been"
"you can call me almost any time, 'cept when you're under neon lights"
"'cause you say you love me, and we know you don't mean it"
so just don't call me when you're drinking
just don't call me when you're drinking
'cause i'll pick up and you'll uber here
we'll do what we always do and you'll disappear
"then i'll wake up, still holding on"
to something that i'll only have 'til you're sober and you're gone
you can call me an ex when you hang out with friends
"you can call me on a sunday, just to ask me how i've been"
"you can call me almost any time, 'cept when you're under neon lights"
"'cause you say you love me, and we know you don't mean it"

'cause i'll start thinking that this time you really need me
my heart won't learn the lesson that you're always gonna leave me
you can call me an ex when you hang out with friends
"you can call me on a sunday, just to ask me how i've been"
"you can call me almost any time, 'cept when you're under neon lights"
"'cause you say you love me, and we know you don't mean it"
so just don't call me when you're drinking
just don't call me when you're drinking
"a one, two, three, two, two three."
"i let love die, broke a woman's heart"
have only myself to blame
"fate ran its course, i suffered a loss"
i learned a lesson in pain
"i cheated and lied, i took love for granted."
acting as cold as ice
but it's all in the past
i won't make the same mistake twice
once is enough
it's one time too many
change is rough
ooo once is enough
"love went through such a sudden change,"
takin' a turn for the worst
"joy turned to fear, the pain got so severe"
"lord, i thought i was cursed."
"you get what you give, it comes 'round full circle"
ooo and i paid the price
i lost love so fast
i won't make the same mistake twice.
brrrr hoo!
"i let love die, broke a woman's heart"
and only myself to blame
"fate ran its course, i suffered a loss"

her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine
she heard his voice on the other end of the line
she wondered what was wrong this time
she never knew what his calls might bring
"with a cowboy like him, it could be anything"
and she always expected the worst
in the back of her mind
"he said, it's cold out here and i'm all alone"
"i didn't make the short go, again and i'm coming home"
i know i've been away too long
i never got a chance to write or call
and i know this rodeo has been hard on us all
but i'll be home soon
and honey is there somethin' wrong
"she said, don't bother comin' home"
by time you get here i'll be long gone
there's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man
"he said, i'm sorry it's come down to this"
there's so much about you that i'm gonna miss
but it's alright baby
if i hurry i can still make cheyenne
gotta go now baby
if i hurry i can still make cheyenne
he left that phone danglin' off the hook
then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
then he just walked away
he aimed his truck toward that wyoming line
with a little luck he could still get there in time
and in that cheyenne wind he could still hear her say
"she said, don't bother comin' home"
by time you get here i'll be long gone
there's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man
"he said, i'm sorry it's come down to this"
there's so much about you that i'm gonna miss
but it's alright baby
if i hurry i can still make cheyenne
gotta go now baby
if i hurry i can still make cheyenne
she never knew what his calls might bring
"with a cowboy like him, it could be anything"
and she always expected the worst
in the back of her mind
i looked at your face
i saw that all the love had died
i saw that we had forgotten to take the time
"i, i saw that you couldn't care less about what you do"
you couldn't care less about the lies
you couldn't find the time to cry
we forgot about love
we forgot about faith
we forgot about trust
we forgot about us
now our love's floating out the window
our love's floating out the back door
our love's floating up in the sky
"in heaven, where it began"
back in god's hands
you said that you had said all that you had to say
"you say 'baby, it's the end of the day'"
we gave a lot but it wasn't enough
we got so tired that we just gave up
now our love's floating out the window
our love's floating out the back door
our love's floating up in the sky
"in heaven, where it began"
"back in god's hands, back in god's hands"
we didn't respect it
we went and neglect it
we didn't deserve it
but i never expected this
our love floated out the window
our love floated out the back door
our love floated up in the sky
"to heaven, it's part of a plan"
"it's back in god's hands, back in god's hands"
"oh, we didn't last, it's a thing of the past"
no we didn't understand just what we had
"oh, i want it back, just what we had"
"i want it back, just what we had"
there's a summer place where it may rain or storm yet i'm safe and warm
for within that summer place your arms reach out to me
and my heart is free from all care
for it knows there are no gloomy skies when seen through the eyes
of those who are blessed with love
and the secret of a summer place is that it's anywhere
anywhere when two people share all their hopes all their dreams all their love
and the secret of a summer place...
i walk up to my door and hate to turn the key
emptiness is all that waits inside for me
that's how it is when the one you love is gone
that's how it is when your house is not a home
i look around and see things marked with his and hers
little things like this just make things that much worse
that's how it is since i live my life alone
that's how it is since my house is not a home
is there a way out for a soul so torn as mine
each day i live i'm like a prisoner passing time
that's how it is ask anyone who lives alone
that's how it is when your house is not a home
that's how it is when your house is not a home
i rode a freight train to el paso texas
happiness i was tryin' so hard to find
walked across the rio grande to another country
trying to get my baby off my mind
trying to get my baby off my mind
they tell me that she's out in california
sometimes i think she's still walking by my side
i know another's world now she lives in
i'm trying to get my baby off my mind
i'm trying to get my baby off my mind
i hear that she has gone and wed another
i know now a new love's hard to find
i walk the streets all night in el paso

things i learned in a hobo jungle
"were things they never taught me in a classroom,"
like where to find a handout
while thumbin' through chicago in the afternoon.
"hey, i'm not braggin' or complainin',"
just talkin' to myself man to man.
this ole' mental fat i'm chewin' didn't take alot of doin'.
but i take alot of pride in what i am.
"i guess i grew up a loner,"
i don't remember ever havin' any folks around.
"but i keep thumbin' through the phone books,"
and lookin' for my daddy's name in every town.
"and i meet lots of friendly people,"
that i always end up leavin' on the lam.
where i've been or where i'm goin'
"didn't take alot of knowin',"
but i take alot of pride in what i am.
--- instrumental ---
"i never travel in a hurry,"
'cause i got nobody waitin' for me anywhere.
"home is anywhere i'm livin',"
"if it's sleepin' on some vacant bench in city square,"
"or if i'm workin' on some road gang,"
or just livin' off the fat of our great land.
"i never been nobody's idol, but at least i got a title,"
and i take alot of pride in what i am.

she treats me right and loves me all the time
sometimes im broke and blue as i can be
sometimes im broke and blue as i can be
sometimes im broke and blue as i can be
but still my baby she looks after me
she walked in the rain till her feet got soaking wet
she walked in the rain till her feet got soaking wet
she walked in the rain till her feet got soaking wet
and this she said to every man she met
mister change a dollar - gimme a lousy dime
mister change a dollar - gimme a lousy dime
mister change a dollar - gimme a lousy dime
so i can feed that hungry man of mine
that gal of mine shes one way all the time
that gal of mine shes one way all the time
that gal of mine shes one way all the time
she takes the blues away and satisfies my mind
on the road again
just can't wait to get on the road again
the life i love is makin' music with my friends
and i can't wait to get on the road again
on the road again
goin' places that i've never been
seein' things that i may never see again
and i can't wait to get on the road again
on the road again
like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
we're the best of friends
insisting that the world be turnin' our way
and our way
is on the road again
just can't wait to get on the road again
the life i love is makin' music with my friends
and i can't wait to get on the road again

"the red-headed stranger from blue rock, montana,"
rode into town one day.
"and under his knees was a ragin' black stallion,"
and walkin' behind was a bay.
"the red-headed stranger had eyes like the thunder,"
"and his lips, they were sad and tight."
"his little lost love lay asleep on the hillside,"
and his heart was heavy as night.
"don't cross him, don't boss him."
he's wild in his sorrow:
he's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
"don't fight him, don't spite him;"
"just wait till tomorrow,"
maybe he'll ride on again.
"a yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window,"
an' watched as he passed her way.
"she drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion,"
but cast greedy eyes on the bay.
"but how could she know that this dancin' bay pony,"
meant more to him than life.
"for this was the horse that his little lost darlin',"
had ridden when she was his wife.
"don't cross him, don't boss him."
he's wild in his sorrow:
he's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
"don't fight him, don't spite him;"
"just wait till tomorrow,"
maybe he'll ride on again.
"the yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern,"
an' looked up the stranger there.
"he bought her a drink, an' he gave her some money,"
he just didn't seem to care.
"she followed him out as he saddled his stallion,"
an' laughed as she grabbed at the bay.
"he shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her,"
she never heard anyone say:
"don't cross him, don't boss him."
he's wild in his sorrow:
he's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
"don't fight him, don't spite him;"
"just wait till tomorrow,"
"maybe he'll ride on again."""
the yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset;
"the stranger went free, of course."
"for you can't hang a man for killin' a woman,"
who's tryin' to steal your horse.
"tthis is the tale of the red headed stranger,"
"and if he should pass your way,"
"stay out of the path of the ragin' black stallion,"
and don't lay a hand on the bay.
"don't cross him, don't boss him."
he's wild in his sorrow:
he's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
"don't fight him, don't spite him;"
"just wait till tomorrow,"
maybe he'll ride on again.
have yourself a merry little christmas
let your heart be light
from now on our troubles
will be out of sight
have yourself a merry little christmas
make the yuletide gay
from now on our troubles
will be miles away
here we are as in olden days
happy golden days of yore
faithful friends who are dear to us
"gather near to us, once more"
through the years we all will be together
if the fates allow
hang a shining star upon the highest bough
and have yourself a merry little christmas now
i'd walk for miles cry or smile for mama and daddy
i want them i want them to know
just how i feel my love is real for my mama and daddy
i want them to know i love them so
in my heart joy tears start cause i'm happy
and i pray every day for mom and pappy and each night
i'd walk for miles cry or smile for my mama and daddy
i want them to know i love them so
[ guitar - steel ]
i'd fight in wars do all the chores for my mama and daddy
i want them to live on till they're called
i'd work and slave and never rave to my mama and daddy
because i know i owe them my all
in my heart joy tears start...
the sun
just went behind a cloud
there's darkness
all around me now
for i've just destroyed
the world i'm livin' in
i broke her heart
so many times
that now at last
i've broken mine
and i've just destroyed
the world i'm livin' in
(2x):
what made me think
that i could go on
hurting her
i should have known
there'd have to be an end
but fools in love
are taught by fate
they never learn
till it's too late
and i've just destroyed
the world i'm livin' in
dear heart wish you were here to warm this night
my dear heart it seems like a year since you went out of my sight
a single room a table for one it's a lonesome town alright
but soon i'll kiss you hello at our front door
and dear heart i want to know i'll leave your arms never more
[ tube ]
a single room a table for one...
all the raindrops
in the sky tonight
can't compare with all the pain
and all the tears i've cried
but now i'm done
all the make believe
locked in this picture frame
is gonna stay behind
along with all the burning rage
that's been tearing through my heart
killing me slowly
every beat i was falling apart
sometimes you give
sometimes they take
sometimes you bend
and sometimes they break you down
sometimes you stick around
"trying to change them, make them"
someone that they'll never be
sometimes you leave
all this time i've spent
staring at the door
i never had the strength
to pack my bags
and leave before
but now i'm done
lying to myself when it's clear
that you're not that one
sometimes you give
sometimes they take
sometimes you bend
and sometimes they break you down
sometimes you stick around
"trying to change them, make them"
someone that they'll never be
and sometimes you leave
when there's nothing left
for me to leave behind
and you're already too far gone
to say goodbye
sometimes you give
sometimes they take
sometimes you bend
and sometimes they break you down
sometimes you stick around
"trying to change them, make them"
someone that they'll never be
and sometimes you leave
oh when the sun beats down and burns the tar up to the roof
and your shoes get so hot you wish your tired feet were fire proof
(under the board walk down by the sea)
on a blanket with my baby's just where i'll be
(under the boardwalk) out of the sun
(under the boardwalk) we'll be havin' some fun
(under the boardwalk) people walking above
(under the boardwalk) we'll be falling in love
(under the boardwalk boardwalk)
from the park you hear the happy sound of a carousel
you can almost taste the hot dogs and french fries they sell
(under the boardwalk down by the sea) on a blanket with my baby's where i'll be
(under the boardwalk) out of the sun...

just a single mom raising up the kids
little tommy's seven now and
her daughter justine just turned ten
"pinchin' every cent, laughin' and lovin' and content"
you would never think a couple years ago
"she almost let her job, her kids, her mind, her life go up in smoke"
right there on the edge right before the fall
"somebody said a prayer, somebody had some faith"
somebody finally hit their knees and asked for help for heaven's sake
somebody finally found someone who really cares
somebody said a prayer
he was seventeen and his heart was broke
"the middle of the night, a bottle full of pills and a goodbye note"
sittin' on his bed but then he bowed his head
now i see him every week and every now and then
he talks about that night and the peace that came over him
"talk about a sign, can i get an amen?"
well there were tears on his face
he said look what happened lord
"somebody said a prayer, somebody had some faith"
somebody finally hit their knees and asked for help for heaven's sake
somebody finally found someone who really cares
somebody said a prayer
"somebody said a prayer, somebody had some faith"
somebody finally hit their knees and asked for help for heaven's sake
somebody finally found someone who really cares
somebody said a prayer
can i get an amen? oh

sunrise doesn't last all morning
a cloudburst doesn't last all day
seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
it's not always gonna be this gray
all things must pass
all things must pass away
sunset doesn't last all evening
the moon can blow the clouds away
after all this my love is up and must be leaving
it's not always gonna be this gray
all things must pass
all things must pass away
all things must pass
none of life's strings can last
so i guess i'll be on my way
to face another day
now the darkness only stays the nighttime
in the morning it will fade away
daylight is good at arriving at the right time
it's not always gonna be this gray
all things must pass
all things must pass away
all things must pass
all things must pass away
so i guess i'll be on my way
to face another day
she said sing a song sweet music man
cause i won't be there to hold your hand like i used to
i'm through with you
you're a hell of a singer and powerful man
but you surround yourself with people who demand so little of you
you touched my soul with your beautiful song
even had me singin' along right with you you said i need you
then you changed the words and added harmony
sang the song you had written for me to someone new
nobody sings love songs quite like you do nobody else can make me sing along
nobody else can make me feel the things are right when i know they're wrong
nobody sings love songs quite like you
sing your song sweet music man
travel the world with a six piece band that does for you
what you ask me to
and you try to stay young but the songs are sung
to so many people who've all begun came back on you
sing your song sad music man makin' your living doing one night stands
they're through with you they don't need you
you're still a hell of a singer but a broken man
but you'll keep on lookin' for one last fan to sing to
nobody sings a love song quite like you do nobody else can make me sing along
nobody else can make me feel the things are right
when they're wrong with a song
nobody sings a love song quite like you
she said sing your song sweet music man i believe in you

hey don't give em what they think they want
cause they don't have a clue
yeah if you really wanna give em something different
something to sink their teeth into
"well baby, you just do what you do"
all eyes were on alice

a drunk man walking down a rainy street
a wood floor and new socks on your bare feet
you look down and suddenly you're looking up
"whoops, i slipped and fell in love"
a bald tire running on an icy road
a steep hill underneath a foot of snow
a greased pig fallen off a pickup truck
"whoops, i slipped and fell in love"
i hope that you're feeling the way that i feel
it's just like flying but you're standing still
the birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
"whoops, i slipped and fell in love"
an ice cube hiding on your kichen floor
a bad step leading up to your back door
how'd i wind up on my butt
"whoops, i slipped and feel in love"
i hope that you're feeling the way that i feel
it's just like flying but you're standing still
the birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
"whoops, i slipped and fell in love"
i hope that you're feeling the way that i feel
it's just like flying but you're standing still
the birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
"whoops, i slipped and fell in love"
"help, i've fallen i can't getup"
"whoops, i slipped and fell in love"
being born was the worse and the first mistake i ever made
"the doctor didnæš° spank me, he just slapped me in the face"
and the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirst
leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt
'cause i was raised an orphan
never wanted as a kid until the year i turned 13
"then everybody did, strangers pass me back and forth"
men just took me as they pleased
and others had a cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep
though the deck is stacked against you
"win or lose, you have to play"
the hand a life has dealt you
and itæš¯ a gamble either way
on a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dress
with the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck
and the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time
or should i fear what lay before me less than what i'd left behind
a 15 year old girl donæš° have no trouble hitching rides
but sometimes when you're riding free
youæš£l pay the highest price
on back roads and in back seats
and in a cheap highway motel
but whatæš¯ a few more strangers in a life of nothing else
"16 caught me crying, underneath the scarlet light"
on the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night
when i walked into the parlour here
other pieces seemed to fit
i was good at pleasing strangers
so i made the most of it
either way itæš¯ all a gamble
so view the stakes and know the odds
and lay your cards upon the table
do all the dealing from the top
"a clean shirt, new shoes"
and i don't know where i am goin' to
"silk suit, black tie (black tie),"
i don't need a reason why.
they come runnin' just as fast as they can
'cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man
"a gold watch, diamond ring,"
i ain't missin' not a single thing
"cufflinks, stick pin (stick pin),"
when i step out i'm gonna do you in
they come runnin' just as fast as they can
'cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man
--- instrumental ---
"top coat, top hat,"
i don't worry 'cause my wallet's fat
"black shades, white gloves,"
lookin' sharp and lookin' for love
they come runnin' just as fast as they can
'cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man...
why so lonely why is my world in such a spin
now he's gone and yet i guess i still love him
why so lonely why all this misery
i knew it couldn't last he never belong to me
if i'd been smart i would have never taken that second chance
he hurt me once before and now he's done it again
why so lonely...
why so lonely why so lonely
oh i'm blessed and i know i am
god has dealt me a winning hand
a loving woman and a fairy land for me
oh and i can't believe it half the time
when i look at her in perfect light
sweet vision every day and night i see
my baby has big green eyes
brighter than the bluest sky
softer than an angel flies
sweeter than a lullaby
and she loves me without design
her picture never leaves my mind
i don't deserve a love this fine
baby and her big green eyes
oh and i'm never very far away
even if i'm in another place
her smile you can't erase from me
(instrumental)
oh and i'm thankful every waking hour
for the love of a gentle flower
a face i will never tire or leave
her picture never leaves my mind
i don't deserve a love this fine
baby and her big green eyes
a mother wrote a letter asking how much longer must i wait
before you send my boy back home to me
for my eyes are growing dim and i'm longing for my jim
please hurry up and let my boy go free.
the warden read the letter and a tear fell from his eye
sitting down he wrote her this reply
there's a little box of pine on the 7:29 bringing back a lost sheep to the fold
there's a valley filled with tears as the train of sorrow nears
the night is dark and the world is growing cold
there he's taking his last ride
down the trail no more he'll roam
on his face there is a smile
he know he's going home
the church was filled with people as the organ softly played
on their knees the congregation prayed
as they softly sang a hymn for poor widow's jim
for he's happy for he's going home to stay
cold winds may blow over the icy sea
i'll take with me the warmth of thee a taste of honey
a taste much sweeter than wine
i will return i'll return i'll come back for the honey and you
i'll leave behind i'll leave behind my heart to wear
and may it e'er remind you of a taste of honey
a taste much sweeter than wine
i will return i said i'll return i'll come back for the honey and you
she ne'er came back to her love so fair
and so he died dreaming of his kiss her kiss of honey
a taste more bitter than wine
i will return oh i'll return i'll come back for the honey and you
i'll come back for the honey and you
i cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
i screamed his name til the neighbors called the cops
i numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
"i don’t know what i did next all i know, i couldn’t stop"
word got around to the barflies and the baptists
my mama’s phone started ringin off the hook
i can hear her now sayin she ain’t gonna have it
"don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look"
"go and fix your make up, girl it’s just a break up"
run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady
"cause i raised you better, gotta keep it together"
even when you fall apart
but this ain’t my mama’s broken heart
wish i could be just a little less dramatic
like a kennedy when camelot went down in flames
leave it to me to be holdin the matches
when the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame
can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make
my mama came from a softer generation
where you get a grip and bite your lip and save a little face
"go and fix your make up, girl it’s just a break up"
run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady
"cause i raised you better, gotta keep it together"
even when you fall apart
but this ain’t my mama’s broken heart
"powder your nose, paint your toes"
line your lips and keep em closed
"cross your legs, dot your i's"
and never let em see you cry
"go and fix your make up, girl it’s just a break up"
run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady
"cause i raised you better, gotta keep it together"
even when you fall apart
but this ain’t my mama’s broken heart
"yeahh, i like a little captain in my coke"
you know i like a little good time in my smoke
with a pair of tan legs hangin' off the tailgate
i like fried chicken right off the bone
i like my peaches home grown
"pickin' on a six string, listenin' to the choir sing"
with a little garth on the radio
a little bit of florida
a little bit of georgia
and a whole lot of country in my soul
you see my roots are buried deep down in the south
and these boots don't get muddy from sittin' around
"out here in the holler, we work hard for a dollar"
from sun up to sun down
well i ain't been handed a thing from the man
and all that i own i got with my own hands
i work hard and play hard so don't be alarmed
that's just who i am
"yeahh, i like a little captain in my coke"
you know i like a little good time in my smoke
with a pair of tan legs hangin' off the tailgate
i like fried chicken right off the bone
i like my peaches home grown
"pickin' on a six string, listenin' to the choir sing"

and a whole lot of country in my soul
"yeah, my way of life is from jesus to jones"
i've got fire in my blood and desire in my bones
i am who i am and i don't give a damn
'cause that's just how i roll
i like a little captain in my coke
you know i like a little good time in my smoke
with a pair of tan legs hangin' off the tailgate
i like fried chicken right off the bone
i like my peaches home grown
"pickin' on a six string, listenin' to the choir sing"
with a little garth on the radio
a little bit of florida
a little bit of georgia
and a whole lot of country in my soul
"yeah, i like a little captain in my coke"
you know i like a little good time in my smoke
with a pair of tan legs hangin' off the tailgate
i like fried chicken right off the bone
i like my peaches home grown
"pickin' on a six string, listenin' to the choir sing"
with a little garth on the radio
a little bit of florida
a little bit of georgia
and a whole lot of country in my soul
"in my soul, in my soul, yeahh"
"in my soul, yeah"
a little bit of florida
a little bit of georgia
and a whole lot of country in my soul!
someday when our dream world finds us
and these hard times are gone
we'll laugh and count our blessings
in a mansion all our own
if we both pull together tomorrow's sure to come
someday we'll look back and say it was fun
we live on love and pennies
and the day dream out of sight
and i'm amazed the way you smile
when things don't turn out right
we climb each hill together each step one by one
and someday we'll look back and say it was fun
someday when our dream world finds us
and these hard times are gone
we'll laugh and count our blessings
in a mansion all our own
if we both pull together tomorrow's sure to come
someday we'll look back and say it was fun
and someday we'll look back and say it was fun
smooth
like a tennessee walker
just a walking on the water
you're smooth
like a sunday morning elvis
singing gospel it's a hell of a groove
like the lines on her mercury
girl you're put together perfectly
good lord almighty
"girl, you go down good"
you ain't even trying
cause you wrote the book
there ain't nobody
a do me like you
the way you move that body
"girl, you're so smooth"
like cat daddy driving
a caddy from cali baby
you're smooth
like young love buzzing
off an old can bottle by the moon
"blackberry jam, finger-licking"
off your hand flying out the window
good lord almighty
"girl, you go down good"
you ain't even trying
cause you wrote the book
there ain't nobody
(there ain't nobody)
a do me like you
(do me like you)
the way you move that body
(the way you move that body)
"girl, you're so smooth"
(so smooth)
"smooth, smooth"
you're a stroke on the canvas
a brick road to kansas
my little summer time jam
good lord almighty
"girl, you go down good"
you ain't even trying
cause you wrote the book
there ain't nobody
(there ain't nobody)
a do me like you
(do me like you)
the way you move that body

"girl, you're so smooth"

smooth
"7:42 in the morning, 8 seconds before it all sinks in"
put your best face on for the world
fake another smile and just pretend
but you're just putting off the pain
nothing's ever really gonna change
"so...let it hurt, let it bleed"
let it take you right down to your knees
let is burn to the worst degree
may not be what you want but it's what you need
sometimes the only way around it
is to let love do its work
and let it hurt
yeah let it hurt
"3:28 in the morning, countin' up the spaces between the rain"
you're getting used to the rocks at the bottom
your heart goes numb but the lonely stays the same
that's the price you're bound to pay
and there's really nothing anyone can say
oh there's only just one way
"so...let it hurt, let it bleed"
let it take you right down to your knees
let it burn to the worst degree
may not be what you but it's what you need
sometimes the only way around it
is to let love do its work
so go on yeah let it hurt
let it hurt
you might just find you're better for it
when you let go and you learn...
"to let it hurt, let it bleed"
let it take you right down to your knees
sometimes the only way around it
is to let love do its work
so go on and let it hurt
oh let it hurt
"7:42 in the morning, 8 seconds before it all sinks in"
well i ain't had nothing to drink
i knew thats probably what you'd think
if i dropped by this time of night
remember way back when
i promised you i'd drop in
at one of those meetings down at the y
"well, they started talkin bout steps you take"
mistakes you make
the hearts you break
and the price you pay
i almost walked away
you could hear a pin drop
when this old man
stood up and said i'm gonna' say it again
like i do every week
for those who don't know me
it's the simple things in life
like the kids at home and a loving wife
"that you miss the most, when you lose control"
and everything you love starts to disappear
the devil takes your hand and says no fear
"have another shot, just one more beer"
"yeah, i've been there, that's why i'm here"
this olâ€™ boy stood up in the aisle
said he'd been living a life of denial
and he cried as he talked about wasted years
i couldn't believe what i heard
it was my life word for word
and all of the sudden it was clear
it's the simple things in life
like the kids at home and a loving wife
"that you miss the most, when you lose control"
and everything you love starts to disappear
the devil takes your hand and says no fear
"have another shot, just one more beer"
"yeah, i've been there, that's why i'm here"
i know for us it may be too late
but it would mean the world to me
if you were there when i stand to say
it's the simple things in life
like the kids at home and a loving wife
"that you miss the most, when you lose control"
and everything you love starts to disappear
the devil takes your hand and says no fear
"have another shot, just one more beer"
"yeah, i've been there, that's why i'm here"
bartender won't you pour me a very strong drink
just keep it coming till i don't have to think
and point out some cowboy that might want to dance
and make sure i get home if you see that i can't
"you see i loved him, he left me for a girl half my age"
i relate to each sad song that ole jukebox has played
"i listen to haggard, ole hank, and george jones"
but why don't more women sing honky tonk songs?
why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs?
about the heartaches and the tough breaks
and the men that's done 'em wrong
there are others just like me that are hurtin' to the bone
so why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs
why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
honky tonk angels are just queens without thrones
"judge not lest you be judged, who can cast the first stone"
why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs
(all you lonely women sing)
why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
about the heartaches and the tough breaks
and all the men that's done us wrong
there's a whole lotta women i know would sing along
so why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
oh you said you were my baby
now i know that you're my baby
but it seems to be you got roamin' eyes
if you wanna be my baby
then you gotta be my baby
you can't keep your finger in two different lives
i remember how you pleaded
when my love you said you needed
and i believe without a doubt
so if you wanna be my baby
then you gotta be my baby
and keep those kissin' cousins out
oh you know how when i said i was a'rollin' low?
i get suspicious and i'm a'gonna tell you so
if you wanna be my baby
then you gotta be my baby
and be nobody's baby but mine
just think about it
now i heard there was another
so i went and asked your mother
if anybody hung around besides me
she gave me no satisfaction
and now i can't take no action
but i think i'll hang around and see
if you wanna be my baby
then you gotta be my baby
you gotta come to me and tell me so
if you wanna be my baby
then you gotta be my baby
i'm tired of waitin' around so let them know
oh how when i said that i'm a rollin low
i'm gunna get suspicious and i'm gunna tell you so
if you wanna be my baby
then you gotta be my baby
and be nobody's baby but mine
i said and be nobody's baby but mine
and i mean it!
down every road there's always one more city
"i'm on the run, the highway is my home"
i raised a lot of cane back in my younger days
while mama used to pray my crops would fail
i'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways:
outrun the law or spend my life in jail
i'd like to settle down but they won't let me
a fugitive must be a rolling stone
down every road there's always one more city
"i'm on the run, the highway is my home"
i'm lonely but i can't afford the luxury
of having one i love to come along
she'd only slow me down and they'd catch up with me
for he who travels fastest goes alone
i'd like to settle down but they won't let me
a fugitive must be a rolling stone
down every road there's always one more city
"i'm on the run, the highway is my home"
"i'm on the run, the highway is my home"
(bob dipiero/john scott sherrill/dennis robbins)
i may not have a whole lot of money
but i got enough girl for you and me
i'm takin' off won't you come with me honey
"gonna take you all the way to paris, tennessee"
i wanna show you the riviera
got good tires and a good cb
put on some lipstick your mascara
"'cause we're goin' all the way to paris, tennessee"
baby i adore you
and don't say i've never done nothin' for you
"girl, that just ain't true"
here we go....
baby i adore you
and don't say i've never done nothin' for you
"girl, that just ain't true"
we might not see no eiffel tower
but i got a cousin that i want you to meet
he can pick the wildwood flower
"better'n anybody down in paris, tennessee"
"we're goin' all the way to paris, tennessee"
"ooooh, la-la, baby"
vous le vous
"even though, the night is early"
"there's a fire, that whispers hurry"
"darling please, turn off the lights and lock the door"
come and lay down here beside me
and tell me i'm soft and pretty
and love me like you never have before.
if this is our last time
make it last me for a lifetime
don't hold back the love you feel inside
why should passion be a shame
if this is our last time
make it last me for a life time
leave me with enough of sunshine
to carry me through the rain.
"in the morning, your gonna be leaving"
"ah, but tonight there'll be no believing"
"i'll have lots of time to cry, when your gone"
"oh, lets not waste one precious moment"
"take all of me, cause i'm your woman"
"and love me until, the break of dawn."
if this is our last time
make it last me for a lifetime
don't hold back the love you feel inside
why should passion be a shame
if this is our last time
make it last me for a life time
leave me with enough of sunshine
to carry me through the rain

you don't know the meaning
"of the words ""i love you so"""
but when you've found your one love
then - you'll know
you don't know the heartache
or the laughter you'll forego
until you've lost that one love
then - you'll know
now you pretend to care for me
"but, honey, if you do"
why don't you give the kind of kiss
i always give to you
"so, i've just made my mind up"
even tho' my tears will flow
go on and find a new love
then - you'll know
then - you'll know

i work so hard to win myself a place in life and leave behind the slums and poverty
now i have wealth a fancy home a pretty wife
she loves the ground i walk on but she don't love me
you like the places that i take you don't you girl
at last you were you've always longed to be
you're very much at home here in this kind of world
you love the ground i walk on but you don't love me
and i know just what would happen if there came a dawn
that i was broken down and out i'd reach and you'd be gone
don't worry girl that kind of dawn will never come
you'll always have the things you want from me
but it's so sad to know that when we're all alone
you love the ground i walk on but she don't love me
you love the ground i walk on but she don't love me

a baby's born in the middle of the night
in the local delivery room
"they grab his feet, smack him until he cries"
he goes home the next afternoon
"before you know it, he's off to school"
and then he graduates in may
goes out and gets a phd. and then cures all sorts of things
wins the noble prize and saves a million different lives
the world's a better place for all he's done
it's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
is all because two people fell in love
right now at a picnic shelter
down by cane creek
"you'll find potato salad, hot dogs and baked beans"
the whole wilson family's lined up filling their paper plates
and they've drove or flown in here from fifteen differentstates
stanley wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
that miss emma tucker was the one
now five generations get together every june
and all because two people fell in love
"yeah, there ain't nothing not affected"
when two hearts get connected
"all that is, will be or ever was"
every single choice we make
every breath we get to take
is all because two people fell in love
while i recall a young man
who was drifting aimlessly
and a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
but in a little cafe right off of 14th avenue
with a whole lot of help from up above
we met and things sure turned around for me and you
and all because two people fell in love
"and baby, there ain't nothing not affected"
when two hearts connected
"all that is, will be or ever was"
i'm glad your dad could not resist
your momma's charms and you exist
all because two people fell in love
you know to me it's all so clear
everyone of us is here
all because two people fell in love
a baby's born in the middle of the night
in the local delivery room
they grab his feet smack him until he cries
he goes home the next afternoon

e
i'm just a man
no more or no less
a
bad as the worst
good as the best
b
if you like what you see
it's a pretty good bet
what you see
is just what you'll get
e
and i've got my faults
that i can't deny
a
nobody knows that better than i do
b
some not so good traits
from my wilder days
e
i've got my faults but i do have my ways
a
i do have my ways
e
that show off the best side of me
a
when you least expect it
e
you don't know how good i can be
"only you, can make this world seem right"
"only you, can make the darkness bright"
"only you, and you alone, can thrill me like you do"
and fill my heart with love for only you
"only you, can make this change in me"
"for it's true, you are my destiny"
"when you hold my hand, i understand"
the magic that you do
you're my dream come true
my one and only you
"only you, can make this change in me"
"for it's true, you are my destiny"
"when you hold my hand, i understand"
the magic that you do
you're my dream come true
my one and only you
one and only you....
i had no idea
that you would be here
as you smile from the corner
and raise up your beer
and then you touch my hand
when you walked by
and i get a contact high
this ain't no crazy party
"no, it ain't no bonnaroo"
hell the only thing smoking
in this place is you
that dress is on fire girl
when i look in your eyes
oh i get a contact high
what you do to me baby
being here in this room
is so damn frustrating
that i can't hold you
and it's driving me crazy
i can smell your perfume
and it goes to my head
so i take a deep breath and i hold it
now the whole world is hazy
and i'm dazed and confused
thing is i ain't touched nothin'
nothin' but you
and that's even just barely
we've been laughing and talking all night
but oh baby
being here in this room
it's driving me crazy
"not holdin', not holdin' you"
and it's just conversation
and second-hand perfume
but it goes to my head
so i take a deep breath
and i hold it
oh i get a contact high
get a contact high
i bless the day i found you
i want to stay around you
and so i beg you
let it be me
don't take this heaven from one
if you must cling to someone
now and forever
let it be me
each time we meet love
i find complete love
without your sweet love
what would life be
so never leave me lonely
tell me you love me only
and that you'll always
let it be me
why do i wait for your call every night
sit next to a phone that never rings
"i do, because i'm lonely"
and lonely people do foolish things.
why do i sit with your picture in sight
when i know all the heartache it brings
"i do, because i'm lonely"
and lonely people do foolish things.
i find myself at a table for two pretending your still there
i carry on a conversation with you
pour out my heart to an empty chair
why do i go on fooling myself
when i know what tomorrow will bring.
"one more day i'll be lonely, and lonely people"
"ah, lonely people do foolish things"
one more day i'll be lonely
"and lonely people, yes, lonely people do foolish things."
"baby, i’ll be there"
to lift you up
i’ll dry your eyes
"oh, when you cry"
when you’re alone
and nobody’s there to take you through the night
"oh, when nothing’s right"
call out my name
"oh, don’t be ashamed to say you need a hand"
"i understand, baby"
sometimes the night can be so dark and cold
no one beside you
and no one to hold
"hold on, hold on"
when you cry
i will dry your eyes
when you fall
i’ll lift you up high
you just reach
for these arms of mine
i promise they won’t let you go
and i’ll make you smile
when you cry
you’re always strong
always got a hand to lend to someone else
don’t need no one else
what about those times
when that heart inside is crying out for love
"for someone, baby"
someone to lean on when the tears start to fall
lean on me i’ll see you through it all
"just hold on, hold on"
when you cry
i will dry your eyes
when you fall
i’ll lift you up high
you just reach
for these arms of mine
i promise they won’t let you go
and i’ll make you smile
when you cry
hold on to me
when you’re not feeling strong
"hold on, baby, hold on"
when you cry
i will dry your eyes
when you fall
i’ll lift you up high
you just reach
"for these arms of mine, baby"
i promise they won’t let you go
when you cry
when you cry
when you cry
"oh, baby"
yeah

full bill monroe lyrics...
last night all alone in a barroom i met a girl with a drink in her hand
she had ruby red lips and coal black hair and eyes that would tempt any man
then she came and sat down at my table and as she placed her soft hands in mine
i found myself wanting to kiss her for temptation was flowing like wine
and i was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
then we danced and she whispered i need you
take me away from here and be my man
then i looked into her eyes and i saw it the reflection of my wedding band
and i was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on
almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home
baby i don't understand
with just a touch of your hand
can make me feel invincible
do you know just where you take me?
do you know how high you make me?
i need your kiss like oxygen
with your arms warm around me
when your eyes look deep into me
it's un-stopable
baby anything is possible
everything i wanna be
any dream i wanna dream
"i can, because of your love"
anywhere i ever go
with all of my heart i know
i am the man i am
because of your love
don't know how i lived before you
now i live to explore you
take me girl to your secret world
where i could swim in your deep blue passion
or i could feel your love come crashing over me
endlessly
whether your right by my side or
whether you and i are a million miles apart
i can always feel you in my heart
everything i wanna be
any dream i wanna dream
"i can, because of your love"
anywhere i ever go
with all of my heart i know
i am the man i am
because of your love
everything i wanna be
any dream i wanna dream
"i can, because of your love"
anywhere i ever go
with all of my heart i know
i am the man i am
because of your love
ooooh baby

g d
pretend i never happened
a
erase me from your mind
e
you will not want to remember
a
any love as cold as mine
g d
i'll be leaving in the morning
a
for a place i hope i find
e
all the places must be better
a
than all the ones i leave behind
e
i don't suppose you'll be unhappy
a
you'll find ways to spend your time
a
but if you ever think about me
e
and if i ever cross your mind
"baby, won't you come out tonight"
just come up the hill
'cause there's a full moon on the risin'
"hey baby, can't you steal away"
you know i really need to see you tonight
i just got word you was packin' it in
what's the matter
this old town got you crazy again
i can see the sad look in your eyes
but i don't know how to say goodbye
"and tommorrow, you're gonna have your day"
take your wife and you're gonna run away
baby while i'm wailin'
you'll be sailin' like a hog across the bay singin'
"ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"mmmmm, baby, won't you come out tonight"
"oh baby, won't you come out tonight"
we'll run up the hill and we'll dance in the moonlight
let me gaze into your eyes 'til we both go blind
"oh baby, can i see you tonight"
i'm just tryin' to find a way to make it last
"good friends, they seem to slip away so fast"
an' i know we're both headed down seperate tracks
"an' when ya' go, baby don't look back"
there won't be no more sleepin' over on a tuesday night
no more runnin' to the races for a dark horse at midnight
no more dancin' after hours
singin' in the showers
or clingin' to each other in the soft mornin' light singin'
"ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight"
"oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight"
i'll meet ya' on the corner
and you'll be there at midnight
"oh baby, can you steal away"
you know i really want to see ya' tonight
"ooo baby, can you come out tonight"
we'll run up the hill and dance again in the moonlight
"oh baby, can you steal away"
i really wanna see you tonight
fade:
"oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight"
come up the hill
there's a full moon on the rise
"oh baby, can ya' steal away"
"baby, won't ya' come out tonight"
oooooo...
"jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock"
jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
"now, the jingle hop has begun"
"jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell twist"
jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
dancin' and prancin' in jingle bell square
in the frosty air
"what a bright time, it's the right time"
to rock the night away
jingle bell time is a swell time
to go riding in a one-horse sleigh
"giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet"
jingle around the clock
mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
that's the jingle bell rock
"what a bright time, it's the right time"
to rock the night away
jingle bell time is a swell time
to go riding in a one-horse sleigh
"giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet"
jingle around the clock
mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
that's the jingle bell
that?s the jingle bell
that?s the jingle bell
that?s the jingle bell rock
it's really coming down outside
every now and then a rumble of thunder rolls across the sky
the way you're crawling into my seat
"i can tell the storm tonight will have nothing on you, babe"
every song that's coming on is setting the mood tonight
getting us right
"like every kiss off of your lips, hitting me strong than"
the lightning strike
never heard anything like that
the way you whisper my name
making love to the sondtrack
of the radio and the rain
i don't see nothing but your silhouette
"illuminated by the pedal on my dash, it's got your back wet"
we were fogging up the windows
guess it's a pretty good thing
we're parked on some no name road
every song that's coming on is setting the mood tonight
getting us right
"like every kiss off of your lips, hitting me strong than"
the lightning strike
never heard anything like that
the way you whisper my name
making love to the sondtrack
of the radio and the rain
the radio and the rain
it's really coming down outside
but i got your shadow fading into mine
every song that's coming on is setting the mood tonight
getting us right
"like every kiss off of your lips, hitting me strong than"
the lightning strike
never heard anything like that
the way you whisper my name
making love to the sondtrack
of the radio and the rain
the radio and the rain
there are so many classy guys with classy uptown ways
and i am so afraid that they will steal you someday
but don't let 'em darlin' cause you belong to me
so don't ever let them make you think your love is fancy free
don't do it darlin' that heart belongs to me
they'll tell you that i trifle and that you should do the same
they'll tell you that they need your love so why not make the change
don't do it darlin' that love belongs to me
oh please don't let them blind you i still love you can't you see
don't let 'em darlin' that heart belongs to me
[ harp - guitar - fiddle ]
they'll offer you a mansion ask you if you will be their queen
so they can give you riches make your life a happy dream
but don't you let 'em darlin' that dream belongs to me
oh sure they'll try to buy your love with riches such as these
but let 'em darlin' that heart belongs to me
no don't do it darlin' that heart belongs to me
well it's cloudy in the morning gonna be raining in the afternoon
cloudy in the morning and it's gonna be raining in the afternoon
if you don't like this rainy weather you better pack your bags and move
but if you're running from it brother the only road that i can see
if you're running from it brother the only road that i can see
is the road that leads to nowhere and nowhere is a fool like me
rain keep a falling falling round my window pane
rain keep a falling falling round my window pane
ain't never seen so much rainy weather guess i'll never see the sun again
[ guitar + harmonica ]
save those dimes and nickels save 'em for a rainy day
save your dimes and nickels save 'em for a rainy day
it ain't gonna keep the rain from coming but at least you know you've paid your way
rain rain rain keep a falling...
one night while out for a ramble
the hour was just about nine
i met a young maiden in frisco
on the corner of geary and pine
on her face there was beauty of nature
and her eyes just seemed to expand
her hair was so rich and so brilliant
entwined in a blue velvet band
we strolled down the street together
in my pocket she placed her small hand
she planted the evidence on me
the girl in the blue velvet band
i heard the scream of the siren
and the girl in the blue velvet band
she left me to face all the trouble
with a diamond that was worth ten grand
they sent me to san quentin for stealing
god knows i'm an innocent man
the guilty one now she lie's dying
the girl in the blue velvet band
last night when bed-time was ringin
standing there close to the bars
i fancied i heard a voice calling
far out in the ocean of stars
i'll be out in a year and i'm leaving
but i'll carry the name of a man
that served ten years in prison
for the girl in the blue velvet band
and when i get out i'll endeavor
to live in some other land
and i'll bid farewell to old frisco
and the girl in the blue velvet band
might scare me to death
or chill my bones
break my heart
or warm my soul
but since i'm here and before i go
i'm gonna find out who i am
late one cold thanksgiving night
"they welcomed me, another 60's child"
to a family that's holding tight
"that's part of who i am, yeah"
i got a mama who prays for me
she fights the devil down on her knees
i can't see all that mama sees
but it's part of who i am
she gave me truth and she watched me grow
i told her lines and i test the rope
then i tried a little bit of everything i know
just to find out who i am
who i am
does it matter anyway
who i am
what i've seen along the way
who i am
changes a little everyday
with a lot of truth
and an open heart
i just want half a chance
as long as i'm here and before i go
just to find out who i am
music is my soul's delight
comes to me both day and night
it gives me wings and it gives me flight
and it's part of who i am
i hold onto a simple faith
about the choices and the path i take
that through the good and the bad mistakes
"i'm gonna find out, yeah"
who i am
does it matter anyway
who i am
what i've lost along the way
who i am
it changes a little everyday
with a lot of truth
and an open heart
i just want half a chance
as long as i'm here and before i go
just to find out
did it ever really matter
in that big forever plan
who i am and what i'm here for i don't know
is it wrong to want an answer
try to understand
who i am
does it matter anyway
who i am
what i've learned along the way
who i am
it changes a little everyday
with a lot of truth
and an open heart
i just want half a chance
as long as i'm here and before i go
just to find out
who i am
hard times can't hold us down forever
hard times are gonna fade away
hard times we can't let them stop us darlin'
there will be a better day
"tell me you love me, these days i need you more than ever before"
don't give up on me
nobody else could ever love you more than i do
"we all need someone, someone to believe in"
this life that we are sharing built on love and trust
if it takes a lifetime i will never stop my trying
to build a better life for us
hard times can't hold us down forever
hard times are gonna fade away
hard times we can't let them stop us darlin'
there will be a better day
there will be a better day
high as the wild birds fly
wild and free that's how i dream
i got to keep on dreaming
we can have what we cannot see tomorrow
on the highest mountain
on the highest mountain we can watch those wild birds fly
"we can drift away, find our own blue sky"
as long as you are with me i'll never stop dreaming
hard times can't hold us down forever
hard times are gonna fade away
hard times we can't let them stop us darlin'
there will be a better day
there will be a better day
there will be a better day
she got eyes that cut you like a
knife and
lips that taste like sweet red wine
and pretty legs go to heaven every time
she got a gentle way that puts me at ease
when she walks in the room i can hardly breathe
got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees
she got whatever it is
it blows me away
she's everything i wanted to say to a woman
but couldn't find the words to say
she got whatever it is
i don't know what to do
cause every time i try and tell her how i feel
"it comes out ""i love you"""
you got whatever it is
you know i've never been the type that would ever want to
stay
bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
but that all changed when she walked into my life
and people askin why it is
i tell them i don't know
just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
and she's gonna be my wife
she got whatever it is
it blows me away
she's everything i wanted to say to a woman
but couldn't find the words to say
she got whatever it is
i don't know what to do
cause every time i try and tell her how i feel
"it comes out ""i love you"""
you got whatever it is
cause when she loves love me
girl that's how i feel
cause when she loves me i'm on top of the world
cause when she loves me i can live forever
when she loves me i am untouchable
she got whatever it is
it blows me away
shes everything i wanted to say to a woman
but couldn't find the words to say
she got whatever it is
i don't know what to do
every time i try and tell her how i feel
"it comes out ""i love you"" ""i do"""
you got whatever it is
it's my time

well it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
and it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
well it takes two hearts a cookin' to make a fire grow
and baby you've got what it takes
you know it takes a lot of kissin' to make a romance bloom
yeah yeah it takes a lot of lovin' to make my life complete
yeah it takes a lot of woman to knock me off of my feet
and baby you've got what it takes
yeah i said mm mm mm ah ah mm mm mm

and baby you've got what it takes
a long time forgotten are dreams that just fell by the way
the good life he promised ain't what she's living today
"but she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, lord"
she just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to
come
she's a good-hearted woman in love with a good-timin' man
she loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
"through teardrops and laughter, they'll pass through this world hand-in-hand,"
a good-hearted woman loving her good timing man
"he like the night life, the bright lights and good-timin' friends"
when the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
"lord knows she don't understand him, but she does the best that she can"
'cause she's a good-hearted woman; she loves her good timin' man
"please help me, iæš¦ falling"
in love with you
close the door to temptation
donæš° let me walk through
"turn away from me, darling"
iæš¦ begging you to
"please help me, iæš¦ falling"
in love with you
i belong to another
whose arms have grown cold
but i promised forever
to have and to hold
"i can never be free, dear"
but when iæš¦ with you
i know that iæš¦ losing
the will to be true
"please help me, iæš¦ falling"
and that would be sin
close the door to temptation
donæš° let me walk in
for i mustnæš° want you
"but, darling, i do"
"please help me, iæš¦ falling"
in love with you
i'll have a blue christmas without you
i'll be so blue thinking about you
decorations of red on a green christmas tree
won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me
i'll have a blue christmas for certain
and when that blue blue heartache starts hurtin'
you'll be doing alright with your christmas of white
but i'll have a blue blue christmas
and when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
i'll have a blue mem'ry for certain
you'll be doing alright...
you'll be doing alright...
but i'll have a blue blue christmas
amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost but now i'm found i was blind but now i
see
twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace
my fears relived
how precious did that grace appear the
hours i first believed
amazing grace...
[ guitar ]
now when we've been there ten thousand years bright
shining as the sun
we've no less days to sing
god's praise that when we first begun
amazing
grace...
[ piano ]
amazing grace...
i was blind
but now i see
i've been throwing horseshoes
over my left shoulder
i've spent most all my life
searching for that four-leafed clover
"yet you ran with me,"
chasing my rainbows
"and honey i love you, too"
that's the way love goes.
"that's the way love goes, babe"
that's the music god made
for all the world to sing
its never old; it grows
losing makes me sorry
"well now, ""honey, don't worry."""
dont u kno i love u too
that's the way love goes.
thats the way love goes babe
thats the music god made
for all the world to sing
it's never old it grows
losin makes me sorry
"you say, honey i dont worry"
i love you too
thats the way love goes
especially with my head pounding
and lying helpless in my bed
i long for you and your expert hands
to ease this white heat from my head
and you would boast that you knew
all the pressure points inside
and you could just as easily kill me
beneath the desire that i hide
but as your patient i knew
that your healing powers had grown
from a sore that's far far deeper
than this heart where the pain was born
with my head again clear
i think of words to send to you
to coax you back to my side
"but always leave out ""i love you"""
and then through my front door
a picture of a faraway land
and to with love on the back
and once again i reach for my pen
fight and scratch
duet by dolly parton and porter wagoner
copyright 1970
fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
there surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
you you to fight and scratch with you
well you just bought a foal last month now you want a wig
it looks like you couldn't understand my paycheck ain't that big
well what about the dough you lose in them poker games downtown
i figured you'd mention that smart aleck
yeah and that brand new boat and that fishin' gear
but no uhhuh i don't reckon that'd count really
fight and scratch fight and scratch...
sometimes i swear i think that you're the devil in disguise
cause when you're mad you oughta see the fire fly from your eyes
well you don't look so cute yourself when you're mad at me
and if you don't like the way i look then you know how to leave bossy catfish
fight and scratch fight and scratch...
well i love you and you love me but we're always findin' fault
but the way we fight you wouldn't know that we had any love at all
we just fight like cats and dogs we'll leave then come right back
for what excitement would we have if we didn't fight and scratch
fight and scratch fight and scratch...
why don't you drop dead oh you'd like me to and i'll live forever just for spite
why don't you keep your big mouth shot
well why don't you just make me if you think you're big enough
yeah and i could whip you with both hands tied behind
yeah you just try it with me and i'll knock your brains out
with a stick of soap that's good catfish
what's a catfish why'd you call me that
they're all mouth and no brains boy that's really good
it's all i can do to keep from laughin' hah
that's funny you sure are a fynny little fellow
"i once had a love, a true and lasting love,"
but the fool in me came out one night.
and with her loving eyes
"she saw right through my eyes,"
and she changed the night
i stepped across the line.
i should have watched that first step
it was a mighty big step
when i started steppin' out of line.
though she's still lovin' me
it's not the way it used to be.
that first step did something to her mind.
i watched her slip away
a little more every day
and my conscience couldn't live
with all that pain.
she's growing colder since the day i told her
and the love we had will never be the same.
i should have watched that first step
it was a mighty big step
when i started steppin' out of line.
though she's still lovin' me
it's not the way it used to be
that first step did something to her mind
found some letters you wrote me this morning they told of a love we once knew
now they're gone i'd burned them to ashes
don't want nothing to remind me of you
sold the house we once planned together said goodbye to friends we knew
then i moved to a faraway city trying hard to forget about you
i've been a rolling stone all my life
"flying all alone, flying blind"
"i've seen it all, i've been around"
i've been lost and i've been found but
who i am with you is who i really want to be
you're so good for me
"and when i'm holdin' you, it feels like i've got the world in my hands"
"yeah, a better man is who i am with you"
i've got a ways to go on this ride
but i got a hand to hold that fits just right
"you make me laugh, you make me high"
"you make me want to hold on tight, 'cause"
who i am with you
because of you i'm a lucky man
you're the best part of who i am
"yes, who i am with you"
this never was one of the great romances
but i thought you'd always have those young girl's
eyes
for now they looking tired and bitter glances
at the ghost of a man walkin' round in my disguise
he gets the feeling that he should belong here
but there's no welcome in the window anyway
and he looks down for a number on his key-chain
cause it feels more like a hotel everyday
there's a stranger in the house nobody's seen his face
everybody says he's takin' my place
there's a stranger in the house no one will ever see
everybody says he looks like me
[ fiddle - guitar ]
and now you say you've got no expectations
but i know you also miss those carefree days
and for all the angry words that passed between them
she still can't understand him when he says
there's a stranger in the house...
he looks like me
i can throw a line
but i can't reel it in
i can throw a dart
but i can't make it stick
the thought of loving you just makes me sick
i don't have the nerve to use my heart
i don't have the nerve to use my heart
i can write the line
but i can't sing the song
i can call my momma
but i won't go home
the thought of loving you just makes me sick
i don't have the nerve to use my heart
i don't have the nerve to use my heart
i won't throw a punch
but i will turn my cheek
i don't go to church no more
but that's what i believe
i don't give two shits no more
or so i say
it wouldn't make a difference
to you anyway
that thought of loving you just makes me sick
i don't have the nerve to use my heart
i don't have the nerve to use my heart
i don't have the nerve to use my heart
i don't have the nerve to use my heart
i don't have the nerve to use my heart
use my heart
he didn't have the answers
to half the questions his son ask him
a child’s mind is a curious thing
but when his son hugged him and said dad
you know i love you
how much do you love me
daddy didn't have to think
with his arms open wide
just as far as they could go
he said as far as i can reach
is not enough to show
i would give my life for you
you are my flesh and blood
i love you this much
she stood there crying
broken-hearted
looking up at him
and said why are you doing this
he looks down at her wanting to hold her
and wipe her tears away
he has to leave and that's the way it is
she gave her son one last kiss
with her arms open wide
just as far as they could go
she said as far as i can reach
is not enough to show
i would give my life for you
you are my flesh and blood
i love you this much
and they raised his broken body above the crowd
drove in the nails as the rain came down
with his arms open wide
just as far as they could go
he said as far as i can reach
is not enough to show
i would give my life for you
you are my flesh and blood
i love you this much
i love you this much
(mary green/rick orozco)
"i never wanted to, but i said goodbye to you"
"it happens, people change"
sometimes their dreams go separate ways
they say all good things must end
still someday i thought i'd see your face again
"i understand, i realize"
it was the end of all those nights
"(with) you here in my arms, just the pounding of two hearts"
now that's all gone with the wind
still someday i thought i'd see your face again
"(oh) i've gotta phone, but no way to get a hold of you"
"i've got a letter, no address that i can send it to"
tonight i'll look out to the stars
can't help but wonder where you are
so much space and time between all those used to be's
"i know life goes on, but then"
still someday i thought i'd see your face again
"i know life goes on, but then"
well i swear i didn't see you with your wife's best girlfriend
drinkin' beer and a dancin' to that western swing
and i didn't see you kiss her and leave that barroom with her
no i didn't see you and i didn't see you and we didn't see a thing
george i know i didn't hear you tell that bloudm that you weren't married
i know i didn't see you hidin' your weddin' ring either did i
and i know i couldn't have heard you call your wife
and tell her that you were working
no i didn't see you and i didn't see you and we didn't see a thing
we've got to stick together to keep our stories straight
no don't forget ray i was down in atlanta sure you were and i was workin' late
yeah you know it's always good to see you george it's good to see you too
but i didn't see you and i didn't see you and we didn't see a thing
[ guitar ]
hey ray by the way do you leave that hundred bucks you owe me
i don't know what you're talkin' about george
well i'm sure you recall our bet on last night's football game
no i don't but you know if i had seen you i certainly would've paid ya
but i didn't see you and i didn't see you and we didn't see a thing
we've got to stick together to keep our stories straight
don't forget i was down in atlanta and don't you forget i was working late
but i didn't see you and i didn't see you and we didn't see a thing
i didn't see you and i didn't see you and we didn't see a thing
if the one you'd think is true ever turns his back on you
you've still got a place in my heart
if every road you take proves you've made a big mistake
baby you've still got a place in my heart
if i'm a fool to pray that you'll come back some day
well then i'll know of million fools that love has turned that way
if the years should make you cry don't go on and live a lie
baby you've still got a place in my heart
if the years should make you cry...
i love it when we're at a party
"in a downtown crowd, oh"
but i can't hear you call me baby
with the music up loud
"red wine, good times"
"no, i don't mind being with everyone else"
and then there's nights like tonight that i
i want you to myself
and tonight i wanna drive so far
we'll only find static on the radio
and we can't see those city lights
and i love the way you look in the firefly glow
saying everything without making a sound
a cricket choir in the background
underneath the harvest moon
standing on your shoes in my bare feet
dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
"oh, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat"
i wanna feeling like a kick drum
beating faster in your chest
i wanna feel you holding onto me
and make me hold my breath
"you pull me closer, my head on your shoulder"
"baby, we won't need a song"
we'll make a falling star wish
one more slow kiss
what are we waiting on?
and tonight i wanna drive so far
we'll only find static on the radio
and we can't see those city lights
and i love the way you look in the firefly glow
saying everything without making a sound
a cricket choir in the background
underneath the harvest moon
standing on your shoes in my bare feet
dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
"yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat"
i wanna feeling like a kick drum
beating faster in your chest
and tonight i wanna drive so far
we'll only find static on the radio
and we can't see those city lights
and i love the way you look in the firefly glow
saying everything without making a sound
with a river rolling in the background
underneath the harvest moon
standing on your shoes in my bare feet
dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
"and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh"
"do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do"
"do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do"
"this hit, that ice cold"
"michelle pfeiffer, that white gold"
this one for them hood girls
them good girls straight masterpieces
"stylin', whilen"

got chucks on with saint laurent
"got kiss myself, i'm so pretty"

i pinch myself
sometimes to make sure i'm not in a dream
that's how it seems
i close my eyes and breathe in the sweetest moments i've ever known
it feels like home
and here i am
i want to be your everything
there you are
turning winter into spring
and everyone that sees you
always wants to know you
and everyone that knows you
always has a smile
you're a standing ovation
after years of waiting
for a chance to finally shine
everyone calls you amazing
yeahhhh
i just call you mine
i fall apart
and just a word from you
somehow seems to fix
whatever's wrong
ohh
you reach into the weakest moments and remind me that i'm strong
you gotta know
i'd be a fool not to see or even worse to forget
that you're more than i deserve
cause everyone that sees you
always wants to know you
and everyone that knows you
always has a smile
you're a standing ovation
after years of waiting
for a chance to finally shine
everyone calls you amazing
i just call you mine
nothing makes sense when you're not here
as if my whole world disappears
without you what's the point of it
cause everyone that sees you
always wants to know you
and everyone that knows you
always has a smile
you're the dream that i've been chasing
after years of waiting
for a chance to finally shine
everyone calls you amazing
i just call you mine

the factories are all shut down and the shopping malls are all closed
and the busy streets are all empty except for the falling snow
"and in the small towns, in the cities families gather as one"
'cause the night of love and sharing they look forward to has come
"'cause tonight is christmas, tonight is love"
tonight we celebrate god's one and only son
tonight there's hope for peace on earth eternally
tonight is christmas and the world's in harmony
but across the seas two armies stare down at each other's guns
each believing in their cause enough to die or kil the other one
"but tonight there'll be no shooting, not a drop of blood will spill"
they will cease their fire this silent night in the name of peace and goodwill
i keep a close watch on this heart of mine
i keep my eyes wide open all the time
i keep the ends out for the ties that bind
because you're mine i walk the line
i find it very very easy to be true
i find myself alone when each day's through
"yes i admit it, i am a fool for you"
because you're mine i walk the line
as sure as night is dark and day's light
i keep you on my mind both day and night
and happiness i've known proves that it's right
"because you're mine, i walk the line"
you've got a way to keep me on your side
you give me cause for love that i can't hide
for you i know i'd even try to turn the tide
"because you're mine, i walk that line"
i keep a close watch on this heart of mine
i keep my eyes wide open all the time
i keep the ends out for the tie that binds
"because you're mine, i walk the line"
"because you're mine, i walk the line"
"because you're mine, i walk the line"
i'm gonna walk it
i'm gonna walk the line
"i'm gonna walk it, walk it, walk it"
i'm gonna walk that line
i'm gonna walk it because you're mine
"i'm gonna walk it, walk it"
i'm gonna walk the line
"i'm gonna walk it, walk it"
i'm gonna walk the line
i'm gonna walk it
i'm gonna walk the line
"everything i tried to do for you, always turned out wrong"
"it took a lot of love inside of me, to keep me here this long"
"it's too late to dim the lights again, expecting me to crawl"
"tonight i'm finally leavin', and i'm leavin' standin' tall."
"if i could see inside your mind, i wonder what i'd find"
"there's something there, that's made me come"
"so close to losing mine, the tallest tree will sometimes bend"
that don't make it fall
"tonight i'm finally leavin', and i'm leavin' standin' tall."
now i'm picking up the pieces of the heart you've been breaking
i'm down on my knees to try and find them all
and when i get up one long last look
is all that i'll be takin'
tonight i'm finally leavin' and i'm leavin' standin' tall.
tonight i'm finally leavin' and i'm leavin' standin' tall...
time stands still for no one
i know this is true
i've been stuck here waiting
then along came you
and you gave me back
the love i had
the faith i'd lost
the life i knew
i wanna thank you for the love that you give me
and the sun that you put in my sky
you don't know how much you've lifted me up
but i feel so alive
that i could fly
"i could fly, oh"
there's no way i could've made it this far
without you
you came to me just when i needed someone to believe
that i could make it through
and you gave me back
the love i had
the faith i'd lost
the life i knew
above the clouds
"fly so high, never come down"
"just you and i, i'm so in love"
"with you, with you"
and you gave me back
the love i had
the faith i'd lost
the life i knew
i wanna thank you for the love that you give me
and the sun that you put in my sky
you don't know how much you've lifted me up
but i feel so alive
"and i could fly, i could fly, oh"
i wanna spread my wings
let me tell you
"said i need your love, i need your love"
stay with me baby
"oh, i need your love, and i need your love"
stay with me baby
"oh, i need your love, i need your love"
stay with me baby
"yeah i need your love, and i need your love"
"stay with me honey baby, c'mon now stay"
"c'mon now, yeah"
you and me side by side walkin' through the woods in the pale moonlight
oh yeah now and it feels so good
sometimes all you need is someone to hold you
sometimes that's all you're looking for
but i'd like to take the time to get to know you
'cause i don't want this time to be like all the times before
i want to know you before i make love to you
i want to show you all of my heart
and when i look into those eyes
i want to feel the love inside you
i want to know you before we make love
i've learned from all those lonely nights with strangers
it takes time for real love to be found
i feel the invitation of your body
but i'd like to look inside your soul before i lay you down
i want to know you before i make love to you
i want to show you all of my heart
and when i look into those eyes
i want to feel the love inside you
i want to know you before we make love
"if we take it slow together, together"
we might make it last forever
i want to know you before i make love to you
i want to show you all of my heart
and when i look into those eyes
i want to feel the love inside you
i want to know you before we make love
"i want to know you before we make, before we make love"
"eve you wicked woman, you done put your curse on me"
why didn't you just leave that apple hangin' in the tree
"you make us hate our husbands, our lovers and our boss"
why i can't even count the good friends i've already lost
"cause of pms blues, pms blues"
"i don't even like myself, but it's something i can't help"
"i got those god almighty, slap somebody pms blues"
"most times i'm easy going, some say i'm good as gold"
"but when i'm pms i tell ya, i turn mean and cold"
those not afflicted with it are affected just the same
"you poor old men didn't have to grin and say ""i feel your pain"""
"pms blues, pms blues"
you know you must forgive us for we care not what we do
"i got those can't stop crying, dishes flying pms blues"
but you know we can't help it
we don't even know the cause
"but as soon as this part's over, then comes the menopause"
"oh, lord, oh, lord"
we're going to always be a heap of fun
"like the devil taking over my body, suffering, suffering, suffering"
"everybody's suffering, huh?"
"but a woman had to write this song, a man would be scared to"
lest he be called a chauvenist or just fall victim to
those pms blues
you know we'd kill for less than that
pms blues
you don't want to cross my path
cause a pitbull ain't no match
"for these teeth a clenchin', fluid retention"
"head a swellin', can't stop yellin'"
"got no patience, i'm so hateful"
"pms blues, premenstrual syndrome"
"got those moods a swingin', tears a slingin'"
nothin' fits me when it hits me
"rantin', ravin', misbehavin'"
pms blues
it's the only time in my life i ever think about wishing i'd been a man
but you know that only means one thing
"if i'd have been a man, i'd be somewhere right this very minute"
"with some old cranky, naggin', raggin' hateful woman"
with those old pms blues
pms blues
"i don't want to talk about it, we both could do without it"
"got those treat your kids bad, don't you talk back"
"gone ballistic, unrealistic"
"awful lowdown, bitch to be around"
pms blues
one more hotel room
one more night away from you
one more phone call
to say i'll be home soon
i'm just so tired
of all the distance in between
all i really need is you with me
"i miss your voice, i miss your smile"
i wish i could give you
a kiss from a thousand miles
"sleep well, my love"
tonight when you close your eyes
hear my long distance lullaby
"la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la la [x2]"
i know it's hard when i'm so far away
and these words can only go so far to say
"i miss you're voice, i miss your smile"
i wish i could give you
a kiss from a thousand miles
sleep well my love
tonight when you close your eyes
hear my long distance lullaby
la la la la (just close your eyes)
la la la la (i'm coming home)
la la la la (you'll hear me singing)
la la la la (i know it's hard)
la la la la (i'm coming home)
la la la la (and we'll be singing la la)
"well, here he comes"
the plane is on the runway
and it's right on time
it's been so long since he left me here
to make it on my own
and then he called
he said his life was empty and he's sorry now
he's changed his mind
he tells me that he still loves me like he always did
and now he's coming home.
and now i see him smiling
and he's waving as he steps upon the runway
"yes, i can see him running now"
and i can hear him calling out my name
the tears are falling in my eyes
'cause now i have to find a way to tell him
that i couldn't wait forever
and i made a new life with another man.
"well, here he comes, the man i loved"
but grew tired of waiting for
he stayed away
and i just couldn't stand to be alone
i'll never know just why he left me here
and i still love him so
but now it's done
i couldn't wait forever and i wish i had
'cause now he's coming home.
"yes, here he comes, yes here he comes"
"no, i couldn't wait forever and i wish i had"
'cause now he's - coming home
"well, here he comes"
this has been the longest night i've ever known
it's so long since i felt this alone
sometimes i just can't see the way things are supposed to be
now that the twilight has gone
now there is nothing left to say there you go you have it your own way
been in the dark so long we couldn't see where it went wrong
now that the twilight is gone
the first step is the hardest part where do we take it from here
only after a hardened heart do tears finally disappear
and i'm on my own now that the twilight is gone
[ ac.guitar - dobro ]
lonely nights and crazy days we sure let it slip away
just tell me life goes on is there a new day with every dawn
now that the twilight is gone now that the twilight is gone
now that the twilight is gone
the moon is full and my arms are empty
all night long i've pleaded and cried
you always said the day that you would leave me
would be a cold day in july
your bags are packed not a word is spoken
i guess we said everything with good-bye
time moves so slow and promises get broken
on this cold day in july
sun's comin' up comin' up down on main street
children shout as they're running out to play
head in my hands here i am
standing in my bare feet
watching you drive away
watching you drive away
you said that we were gonna last forever
you said our love would never die
it looks like spring and
it feels like sunny weather
but it's a cold day in july
on sun's comin' up comin' up
down on main street
children shout as they're running out to play
whoa head in my hands
here i am standing in my bare feet
watching you drive away
watching you drive away
the moon is full and my arms are empty
all night long how i've pleaded and cried
you always said the day that
"you would leave me,"
would be a cold day in july
"i'm still here, but yet i'm gone"
i don't play guitar or sing my songs
they never defined who i am
the man that loves you 'til the end
you're the last person i will love
you're the last face i will recall
"and best of all, i'm not gonna miss you"
not gonna miss you
i'm never gonna hold you like i did
or say i love you to the kids
you're never gonna see it in my eyes
it's not gonna hurt me when you cry
i'm never gonna know what you go through
all the things i say or do
all the hurt and all the pain
one thing selfishly remains
i'm not gonna miss you
i'm not gonna miss you
(billy ray cyrus/cindy cyrus)
where'm i gonna live when i get home
my ol' lady's thrown out everything i own
she meant what she said when she wished i was dead
so where'm i gonna live when i get home
i knew our road was gettin' kinda rocky
she said i was gettin' way too cocky
she waited till i was gone
she packed from dusk 'til dawn
so where'm i gonna live when i get home
where'm i gonna live when i get home
my ol' lady's thrown out everything i own
she meant what she said when she wished i was dead
so where'm i gonna live when i get home
she decided she would keep my cat
my transportation i wouldn't be needin' that
she kept my tv
the bills she gave to me
so where'm i gonna live when i get home
where'm i gonna live when i get home
my ol' lady's thrown out everything i own
she meant what she said when she wished i was dead
so where'm i gonna live when i get home
where'm i gonna live when i get home
"where'm i gonna live, where'm i gonna live"

i'm on a honky tonk merry-go-round
actin' like a foolish clown
still racin' those blues that you left with me
wond'rin' if i'll ever be free

ridin' high and feelin' low
round and around just like a top
"well, i'm a-gettin' dizzy, but i can't stop"

fancy cars and diamond rings
i`ve seen all kind of shiny things
i should be feeling like a king
but lord i don´t
great big town so full of users
make a million still a loser
some bet on you to win
most hope you won't
living wild
ain´t no mercy being free
when it brings you to your knees
can´t keep lying
i see the road now
i know just what i need
to find my way back to tennessee
i´m going home now
to southern it's so sweet
and find my way back to tennessee
i was only seventeen
i left behind my beauty queen
i turned my back on everything and everyone
rooms with lots of pretty faces
still don't fill the empty spaces
wondering where amazing grace is
"there is none, no"
now i know there´s no comfort in this world
god i miss that hometown girl
wanna hold her
i´m on the road now
i know just what i need
to find my way back to tennessee
i´m coming home now
to southern it's so sweet
and find my way back to tennessee
oh
all this time
i was chasing after dreams
it was right in front of me
i was lost without her
i´m on the road now
i know just what i need
to find my way back to tennessee
i´m coming home now
to southern it's so sweet
and find my way back to you and me
find my way back to tennessee
springtime is near my darling
you say that you are going away
my heart will be with you my darling
and iã‚â€™m counting now the days
i know that soon iã‚â€™ll have to travel
i know iã‚â€™m over the hill
i feel so all alone my darling said sheã‚â€™d be gone
when i heard that first whippoorwill
the flowers are blooming little darling
with the budding of the trees
i hear the night birds a crying
i know that they are warning me
our love was planted little darling
just like the farmer plants his grain
but there will never be a harvest
on the hills the whippoorwills now sing
no i didn't see you comin' as i was goin' down life's street
i met you and you knocked me off my feet
you left me lame and crippled lovin' you was all i've done
you wrecked my life forever for you're a hit and run
i should have known that you were speeding for you live your life so fast
i should have turned at night and let you pass
but my hungry eyes weren't watching as i met you held on
you left my heart in pieces for you're a hit and run
am i broken up ole body and never be repaired
cuase on the road of true love you left me suffering there
and the heart will be felt always for the demages all've been done
our love is gone forever cause you're a hit and run
yes by accident i love you butr you're a hit and run
it's hard for me to smile i feel like crying yet i always manage to grin
friends won't know the pain that i feel or the misery that i'm in
everyone thinks i'm happy for i smile and never frown
but looks are deceiving and nobody knows the hurt behind the face of a clown
i've got my pride my tears i'll hide whenever you are around
you never may know you hurt me so for i have a face of a clown
i'll try to conceal this pain that i feel i can't let it get me down
you won't have the pleasure of knowin' the hurt behind the face of a clown
(you won't have the pleasure of knowin') the hurt behind the face of a clown
oh they say she's the life of the party
and without her things here would die
oh but don't be fooled by her laugter
she has her sad times she knows how to cry
for she drinks and she talks just a little too loud
and with her pride gone she tags along with any old crowd
yes i know i'm to blame and i feel so ashamed
that i made her the image of me
[ fiddle - steel ]
yes i met her in a little country town
she was simple and old fashion in some way
but she loved me until i dragged her down
then she just gave up and drifted away
now she drinks and she talks just a little too loud...

"oh you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun"

i tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
like a long sermon on a pretty sunday
well it's been rainin' all week long
"i woke up this mornin', the dark clouds were gone"
we've both been raised not to miss church
but on a day like today heaven knows how much it hurts
see that sunlight shinin' through that stained glass
how much longer is this gonna last
"man, i could use a piña colada"
little bit of sun on my skin
"a hammock, a book"
never gonna look back
once my feet hit the sand
i've had it up to here with this rat race
need a smile on my face
i wanna go where i can lighten up the load
drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
get this laying low off to a flying start
play my guitar in the caribbean sun
hang with the locals at the quiet mon
"where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star"
and be as you are
gettin' stuck sure would be easy
in this palm tree paradise
ambition fades with every wave
for the finer things in life
maybe i'll just hang around here
go home later next year
i wanna stay down there where i can lighten up the load
drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
get this laying low off to a flying start
play my guitar in the caribbean sun
hang with the locals at the quiet mon
"where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star"
and be as you are
i wanna play my guitar in the caribbean sun

god and country music
like whiskey and a prayer
like johnny cash's arm
'round billy graham
god and country music
they both never really change
you find 'em when you need 'em
where you stand
there's always lost in the found
"and darkness in the ""i saw the light"""
it's livin' in those small towns
in some church or backroad honky tonk tonight
it's a dance between the sin and the salvation
"come hell or high water, there's two things still worth savin'"
god and country music
god and country music
god and country music
they both show you the truth
they've seen the low of the valley
and the highs of the mountains too
folded hands and guitar strings
jukebox preachers and angels sing
call you like they knew ya
between the hell and hallelujah
there's always lost in the found
"and darkness in the ""i saw the light"""
it's still livin' in those small towns
in some church or backroad honky tonk tonight
it's a dance between the sin and the salvation
"come hell or high water, there's two things still worth savin'"

i've walked through many towns with fortunes lost and found
seen the beauty of this land made by nature and by men
but when i leave i don't look back for i've only left my tracks
seen the lawlest in the law you beat all i ever saw
[ guitar ]
i've dreamed a million miles about your eyes and smiles
i know i've loved the best i can't be content with last
i've scanned the skies of blue for just one glimpse of you
but they threw away the mold of a love that's grown so cold
your heart would never thought you beat all i ever saw
"there’s a big brown cloud in the city,"
and the country side a scene.
the price of life is to high to give up
it’s rather come down again.
when world wide war’s is over and done
and the dream of peace comes true.
we’ll all be drinking that free bubble up
and eat that rainbow stew.
when they’ll found out how to burn water
and the gasoline car is gone
when an airplane flies without any fuel
and the sunlight heats our home
one of these days when the air clears up
and the sun comes shining through
we’ll all be drinking that free bubble up
and eat that rainbow stew.
eat that rainbow stew in a silver spoon
underneath that sky are blue
we’ll all be drinking that free bubble up
and eat that rainbow stew.
you don’t have to get high to get happy
just think about what’s in store
when people start doing what they odd to be doing
and they wont be booing no more
when a president goes through the white house door
does what he says he’ll do
we’ll all be drinking that free bubble up
and eat that rainbow stew
eat that rainbow stew in a silver spoon
underneath that sky are blue
we’ll all be drinking that free bubble up
and eat that rainbow stew
"he's halfin' his sandwich, his chips and baby ruth"
puttin' them back in a sack his mama packed
with a sticker that say's ‘jesus loves you’
"he's jumpin off the bus, runnin' in the house"
talkin' to mom about his day
hidin' that paper sack in a baseball glove
ridin' his bike straight to the freeway
where there's an old man with a shoppin' cart
with a dirty face and a purple heart
who's sayin' son you'll never know how much this means
boy say's
wouldn't you do this for me
if i were reachin' out to you
wouldn't you give me food to eat if i were hungry to
wouldn't you do this for me
"tonight, that little boy's dad is flyin' down the freeway"
it's pourin' rain as he leaves the road
he's rolling down that concrete bank
through the flames and the broken glass
an old man takes his hand
finds a cell phone on the backseat
he's sayin' get here fast as you can
pulls him safely from that flooding ditch
man asked why'd you risk your life to save mine
he said
wouldn't you do this for me
if i were reachin' out to you
"wouldn't you try to save my life, if i needed you to"
wouldn't you do this for me
now he's layin' in that hospital bed prayin' a silent prayer
"and he can't help but ask him,"
"lord, did you put that beggar there"
as a nurse pulls back the curtains
all he can see is a billboard sign
a sixty foot jesus hangin' on the cross
"at the bottom, just one line"
wouldn't you do this for me
wouldn't you do this for me
wouldn't you
i'm living in two worlds dividing my time
unhappy in your world and lonesome in mine
when i'm in your world i just pretend that i'm really happy though i don't fit in
then i drift in my world so cold and alone i'm living in two worlds where do i belong
i'm living in two worlds...
old friends in your world are new friends to me
so i can't take part in your old memories
our love shared in two worlds that don't turn the same
we each have our own worlds and neither can change
i'm living in two worlds...
it's ten pm and i should have made the road tonight
the moon was out and the clouds came in and took it's light
my suitcase is over there somehow i just don't care
cause i don't want to be anywhere but right here tonight
the rains came down and i should have made an early plane
where i'd rather be if it can't be seen then i can't explain
it's so warm in here and i want to hold you near
and there is no pain or fear right here tonight
with tomorrows dawn i will carry on what i've set aside
it's not a matter of my faith or of my pride
it just seems so insane to strike out in the rain
when it's so easy to remain right here tonight
"hand to mouth,"
i've been livin' from hand to mouth
"days are gettin' longer,"
nights are gettin' colder
since you've been gone
"hand to mouth,"
i've been livin' from hand to mouth
"don't you worry, honey, don't you worry"
somehow i get along
"movin' is my little game,"
i never felt the taste of fame
been on the road since i was just a child
"workin' here, then i'm gone,"
never in one place too long
it's enough to drive a poor man wild
"i've been livin' from hand to mouth,"
i've been livin' from hand to mouth
"don't you worry, honey, don't you worry"
somehow i get along
i'm sorry for the times you've cried
they were the times i've laughed and lied
i really didn't know how much i cared
and now i wish to spend more time
to keep your love and ease your mind
there's nothing quite the same
when it's not shared
(sara evans/james leblanc)
i've been trying to break down your walls
but i don't know how to get through
you say that you want me
you say that you need me
"but baby, i need more from you"
you've gotta take my hand
and lead me to where you are
you know i'll follow
to show me the way to your heart
i know it's hard for you to trust again
but you've just got to believe
i will never lie to you
and i will never hurt you
"baby, i'm asking please"
you've gotta take my hand
and lead me to where you are
you know i'll follow
to show me the way to your heart
think you've locked your heart away
"baby, i hold the key"
believe me when i say
my love can set you free
take my hand
and lead me to where you are
you know i'll follow
to show me the way to your heart
take my hand
and lead me to where you are
"baby, you know i'll follow"
darlin if you think back
to the heartbroken past
before we found each other
"it's so amazing, it's almost crazy"
what a difference lookin through the eyes of love
"life is good, the grass is green"
the good lord smilin on you and me
gonna knock on wood
sweet sunshine everywhere i look
you love me like no one could
life is good
"people stop me on the street, thinkin i'm the old me"
talkin' about the bad old days
but ever since you came along
them old blues are long gone
i break into a grin and all i can say is
"life is good, the grass is green"
the good lord smilin on you and me
gonna knock on wood
sweet sunshine everywhere i look
you love me like no one could
life is good
"someday girl, this old world will try to beat you up"
"let em bring it on, cause everytime we touch"
"life is good, the grass is green"
the good lord smilin on you and me
gonna knock on wood
sweet sunshine everywhere i look
you love me like no one could
life is good
"life is good, the grass is green"
the good lord smilin on you and me
sweet sunshine everywhere i look
you love me like no one could
life is good
"ooo, ooo, ooo-come on,"
"still feels good-oh,oh,oh"
that old t-shirt you wear to bed
hangin' off your shoulder by a thread
the one you ripped off me when
we first met
still feels good
that old familiar song blarin'
from my car
"we know every note, every word"
by heart
puts a smile on your face 'cause
you know it's ours
and it still feels good
your fingers hooked around
my belt loops
leanin' up against my ride
remember that first time i touched you
it doesn't matter-i've held you a
million times
"oh, and it still feels good"
"we made some crazy plans, had some"
crazy dreams
and now that we've reached
a few you would think
that it would get old to you and me
"but it still feels good, still feels good"
"oh, your fingers hooked around"
my belt loops
leanin' up against my ride
remember the first time i touched you
"it doesn't matter, i've held you-"
i've touched you
i've felt you-i've loved you-
and it still feels good
"yeah and it still feels good, baby"
"yeah, it still feeld good-yeah, yeah, yeah"
still feels good
"still feels good, baby"
i wandered so aimless my heart filled with sin
i wouldn't let my dear savior in
then jesus came like a stranger in the night
praise the lord i saw the light
i saw the light i saw the light
no more darkness no more night
now i'm so happy no sorrow in sight
praise the lord i saw the light
just like a blind man i wandered alone
worries and fears i claimed for my own
then like the blind man that god gave back his sight
praise the lord i saw the light
"you were there in my arms, alone in the moonlight"
the trees played the waltz of the wind
it was there i knew i?d love you forever
as we danced to the waltz of the wind
"the stars up above you, look down in your eyes"
and there... i knew
"so, i?ll say goodbye dear, till tomorrow"
till we dance to the waltz of the wind
"you were there in my arms, alone in the moonlight"
the trees played the waltz of the wind
it was there i knew i?d love you forever
as we danced to the waltz of the wind
"the stars up above you, look down in your eyes"
and there in the moonlight i knew
"so, i?ll say goodbye dear, till tomorrow"
till we dance to the waltz of the wind
here we all are at the end of this century of beauty and loss
"greedily ate what you gave us, the rest we tossed"
"we've trapped all your rivers, paved every pass"
pulled out your sky till we caused it to rip
"but you've got jimi hendrix, so let's call it an even split"
i met a girl who has turned my whole world upside down
stars i once stretched for now litter the ground
"cursed by too little lies, and too much belief"
in the strength of another man's words
"but i've got a girl, thank you lord"
ahhh ahhh (x4)
here we all are at the start of another thousand year
all those love stories yet to be told
ours is this river asleep at our feet
blessed by this wet autumn day
here we all are
ahhh ahhh (x4)
"well in the town where i was raised,"
the clock ticks and the cattle graze.
time passed with amazing grace
back where i come from.
"you could lie on a riverbank,"
"or paint your name on a water tank,"
or miscount all the beers you drank
back where i come from.
back where i come from
where i'll be when it's said and done.
"â€˜ ll i'm proud as anyone,"
that's where i come from.
we learned in a sunday school
who made the sun shine through.
i know who made the moon shine too
"back, where i come from."
"blue eyes on a saturday night,"
tan legs in the broad daylight.
tvâ€™s they were black and white
back where i come from.
back where i come from
where i'll be when it's said and done.
"â€˜ ll i'm proud as anyone,"
that's where i come from.
some say it's a backward place
narrow minds on the narrow way
but i make it a point to say
that's where i come from.
that's where come from
where i'll be when it's said and done.
"â€˜ll iâ€™m proud as anyone,"
that's where i come from.
back where i come from
i'm an old tennessean
'll i'm proud as anyone
"tearin' down a dirt road, rebel flag flyin', coon dog in the back"
truck bed loaded down with beer and a cold one in my lap
earnhart sticker behind my head and my woman by my side
"tail-pipe's poppin', the radio's rockin', ""country boy can survive"""
"if you got a problem with that, ha, ha,"
you can kiss my country ass
"well, i love turkey calls, overalls, wrangler jeans"
smoke nothin' but marlboro reds
tattoos up and down my arms
and deer heads over my bed
my granddaddy fought in world war two
but my daddy went to vietnam
and i ain't scared to grab my gun
and fight for my homeland
if you don't love the american flag
you can kiss my country ass
"if you're a down home, backwoods redneck"
"hey come on, stand up and raise your glass"
but if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd
"you can kiss my country ass, aw yeah"
"aw, yeah"
"well, there's a whole lotta high-class people out there"
that's lookin' down on me
'cause the country club where i belong
is a honky tonk till three in the mornin'
"don't wear no fancy clothes, no ties or three piece suits"
you can find me in my camouflage cap
my t-shirt and cowboy boots
if that don't fit your social class
you can kiss my country ass
"if you're a down home, backwoods redneck"
"hey come on, stand up and raise your glass"
but if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd
you can kiss my country ass
"well, i'm a front-porch sittin', guitar pickin', moonshine"
sippin' backer juice spittin' country boy from the woods
and i love fried chicken and blue gill fishin'
"and outlaw women and i wouldn't change if i could, no"
i ain't tryin' to start no fight but i'll finish one every time
so you just mind your own damn business
"stay the hell outta mine, if you got a problem with that"
you can kiss my country ass
"i said, ""if you got a problem with any of that"
"you can kiss my natural born, redneck to the bone"
"ever lovin' country ass, that's right"
old friend
all the stories to tell
old friend
could you bid me farewell
old friend
it might be easy for another man to see
old foe
all the pain and the scars
old foe
could you lay down your arms
old foe
it might be easy for another man to see
put your head down on my pillow
put your hand on me and hold on
hold on
put your head down on my pillow
put your hand on me and hold on
hold on
old friend
old friend
old friend
it might be easy for another man to see
but i think you still look a lot like me
heartbroken me lonesome as can be
heartbroken sad and so blue
lonesome for your charms and your loving arms
heartbroken cause i'm losing you
most every night i lie awake just crying cause we're through
i'd give the world if i could hear that you've been crying too
heartbroken me lonesome as can be
heartbroken cause i'm losing you
[ fiddle ]
heartbroken me lonesome as can be...
most every night i lie awake...
"some glad morning when this life is over,"
i'll fly away;
"to a home on god's celestial shore,"
i'll fly away (i'll fly away).
"i'll fly away, oh glory"
i'll fly away;
"when i die, hallelujah, by and by,"
i'll fly away (i'll fly away).
"just a few more weary days and then,"
i'll fly away;
"to a land where joy shall never end,"
i'll fly away (i'll fly away)
i'll do anything i can to keep our love together one more time
sorry i deceived you
you made it hard for me to stay in line
"loving you came easy, but for reasons i'll explain i drift away"
when the sun goes down and the cat goes out
the mice will play
last week you went to vegas with your friends
and left me here alone
i didn't mind you leavin'
but it hurts when you don't call me when you're gone
see my mind begins to wander
and i'll find someone to take the hurt away
when the sun goes down and the cat goes out
the mice will play
"loving you came easy, but for reasons i've explained i drift away"
when the sun goes down and the cat goes out
the mice will play
you might wake up some morning
to the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
and if you're quick enough to rise
you'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
out on the new horizon
you may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
and if the sleep has left your ears
you might hear footsteps running through an open meadow
"don't be concerned, it will not harm you"
it's only me pursuing something i'm not sure of
"across my dreams, with nets of wonder"
i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
you might have heard my footsteps
echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
i might have even called your name
as i ran searching after something to believe in
you might have seen me runnin'
through the long abandonned ruins of the dreams you left behind
if you remember something there
that glided past you followed close by heavy breathing
"don't be concerned, it will not harm you"
it's only me pursuing something i'm not sure of
"across my dreams, with nets of wonder"
i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
"across my dreams, with nets of wonder"
i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
"across my dreams, with nets of wonder"
i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
if your mind's as cluttered
as your kitchen sink
if your heart's as empty as your diesel tank
if all your white t-shirts have stains
if you've got some goods and got some ink
"well then, we should be friends"
if you borrow dresses like you borrow time
if you dream all day and drink all night
if you're looking for love
but willing to fight
over men and momma's and miller lite
"well then, we should be friends"
i don't know you well but i know that look
and i can judge the cover
'cause i read the book
on losing sleep and gaining weight
on pain and shame and crazy trains
if you paint your nails while
you cut your loss
if you look at them like you're the boss
if everything your daddy says
is something you can put stock in
"well then, we should be friends"
i don't know you well but i know that look
and i can judge the cover
'cause i wrote the book
on losing sleep and gaining weight
on pain and shame and crazy trains
"one, two, three"
if you use alcohol as a sedative
and bless your heart as a negative
if you ride your wild horse like the wind
if what you see is what you get
"well then, oh, we should be friends"
(alright)
[outro]
"well then, oh, we should be friends"
"well then, oh, we can be friends"
and the oil fields fed our family
'neath the amber waves of grain
"god, he was our savior"
though his name was spoke in vain
my dad would leave for work each morning
in the twilight's last gleaming
"""cause every day i'd awaken"
to the american dream.
(from for the love of the game)
"the summer wind, came blowin' in from across the sea"
"it lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me"
"all summer long, we sang a song and we strolled on golden sand"
"two sweethearts, and the summer wind"
"like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by"
"the world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky"
then softer than a piper man one day it called to you
"i lost you, i lost you to the summer wind"
"the autumn wind, and the winter wind they have come and gone"
"still the days, those lonely days that go on and on"
guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
"my fickle friend, summer wind, summer wind"
"oh, summer wind, summer wind"
the postman delivered a letter
and it filled her old heart full of joy
but she didn't know 'till she read the inside
it was the last one from her darlin' boy.
"dear mom was the way that it started,"
i love you so much it went on
mom i didn't know that i loved you so
but i'll prove it when this war is won.
i'm writing this down in a trench mom
don't scold if it isn't so neat
the way that you did when i was a kid
and i'd come home with mud on my feet
the captain just gave us our orders
and mom i will carry them through
and i'll finish this letter the first chance i get
but for now i'll just say i love you
the mother's old hands began to tremble
as she fought against tears in her eyes
but they came unashamed for there was no name
and she knew that her darlin had died
that night as she knelt by her bedside
she prayed 'god above hear my plea
protect all the boys that are fighting this war
and dear god keep america free

i joined the navy to see the world but nowhere could i find
a girl as sweet as cindy the girl i left behind
i've sailed the wide world over can't get her off my mind
cindy oh cindy cindy don't let me down
write me a letter soon and i'll be homeward bound
i see her face in every wave her lips kiss every breeze
her loving arms reach out for me through calm and stormy seas
at night i pace the lonely deck caressed by memories
cindy oh cindy...
i know my cindy's waitin' as i walk the dock alone
her loving arms reach out for me soon i'll be headin' home
then my sailing days will be over and no more will i roam
cindy oh cindy girl...
cindy oh cindy girl...
"lemons are sweet as honey, usually life is fair"
"purple's the shade of money, and jesus doesn't care"
"hummingbirds can't fly backwards, lovers don't say goodbye"
"saturn has seven rings, and i have never told a lie"
i don't walk these halls and i don't climb these walls every night
"and i don't cry, and even though i'm waiting by the phone"
"i don't want you to call, i don't miss you at all"
i'm finally moving forward getting along with my life
"i've never dream of you and me, it's strange i don't know why"
"i'm really not that lonely, you never cross my mind"
"and when i hear your name, it doesn't cut me like a knife"
i don't walk these halls and i don't climb these walls every night
"and i don't cry, and even though i'm waiting by the phone"
"i don't want you to call, i don't miss you at all"
"this is how i keep my sanity, this is what i need you to believe"
i don't walk these halls and i don't climb these walls every night
"and i don't cry, and even though i'm waiting by the phone"
"i don't want you to call, i don't miss you at all"
"lies, all lies"
i saw you sittin' there sippin' red wine
down at causen mills
i knew you'd probably be outta my league
"but i thought, what the hell?"
"aw, what the hell?"
five dollars a glass was kickin' my butt
but i kept on buyin'
i kinda thought you were into me
so i kept on tryin' to get them sparks a'flyin'
"in my forty dollar blue jeans, next to a beauty queen"
used to the finer things
all i had to my name was a big ol' truck and a little ol' place
i couldn't help but think
i can't afford to love you but i can't afford not to
i asked you if you ever stared up
at the stars from a tailgate
down by the river with a six pack
"you said, ""no"" but it sure sounds great"
you climbed up in my old truck
sittin' right beside me
i cranked up a country song
and you started smilin'
"yeah, this ol' boy was stylin'"
"in forty dollar blue jeans, next to a beauty queen"
used to the finer things
"i missed work for three days, kissin' on you, didn't get paid"
i couldn't help but think
i can't afford to love you but i can't afford not to
we been together ever since that night
you're still in love with that same old guy
that same old guy
"in my forty dollar blue jeans, next to a beauty queen"
used to the finer things
"yeah, we set a date for next spring"
"workin' two jobs, pickin' out rings"
"i can't help but think, i can't afford to love you"
i can't afford to love you but i can't afford not to
i can't afford not to love on you

there's a port on a western bay
and it serves a hundred ships a day
lonely sailors pass the time away
and talk about their homes
and there's a girl in this harbor town
and she works layin' whiskey down
"they say ""brandy, fetch another round"""
she serves them whiskey and wine
"the sailors say ""brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)"
"""what a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl)"
"""yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea"""
"(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)"
brandy wears a braided chain
made of finest silver from the north of spain
a locket that bears the name
of a man that brandy loves
he came on a summer's day
bringin' gifts from far away
but he made it clear he couldn't stay
no harbor was his home
"the sailor said "" brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)"
"""what a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl)"
"""but my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"""
"(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)"
"yeah, brandy used to watch his eyes"
when he told his sailor stories
she could feel the ocean fall and rise
she saw its ragin' glory
"but he had always told the truth, lord, he was an honest man"
and brandy does her best to understand
"(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)"
at night when the bars close down
brandy walks through a silent town
and loves a man who's not around
she still can hear him say
"she hears him say "" brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)"
"""what a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl)"
"""but my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"""
"(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)"
"yeah, ""brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)"

[music fades out]
i was standing in the grocery store line
the one they marked express
when this woman came though with about 25 things
and i said don't you know that more is less
she said this world is moving so fast
i just get more behind everyday
and every mornin' when i make my coffee
i can't believe my life's turned out this way
all i could say was
love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
love's the only house big enough for all the pain
he was walking by the other day and i said
hey baby...how you been?
"yeah, i got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old"
and she's got her daddy's little grin
you only wanted what you can't have
and baby you can't have me now
i gave my heart to another
yeah i'm a mother
and he's a father and we're a family and we got each other
and i found out the hard way that
you drive three miles from all this prosperity
down across the river and you see a ghetto there
an' we got children walking around with guns
and they got knives and drugs and pain to spare
"and here i am in my clean, white shirt,"
with a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
and we got teenagers walking around in a culture of darkness
living together alone...all i could say is
"and i can't explain it, and i can't understand"
but i'll come down and get my hands dirty and together we'll make a stand
"somewhere 'cross the parking lot, some bands playin' out of tune"
city streets are gonna burn if we don't do something soon
"senorita can't quit crying, baby's due now any day"
"don juan left, got sick of trying...no one there to show him the way"
she came down to the grocery store and
"she said i, i wanna buy a little carton of milk, but i don't have any money"
"i said hey i'll cover you honey, cause the pain's gotta go somewhere"
yeah the pains gotta go someplace...
so come on down to my house
don't ya know that
forever can never be long enough for me
to feel like i've had long enough with you
forget the world now we won't let them see
but there's one thing left to do
now that the weight has lifted
love has surely shifted my way
marry me
today and every day
marry me
if i ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
say you will
mm-hmm
say you will
mm-hmm
together could never be close enough for me
to feel like i am close enough to you
"you'll wear white and i'll wear out the words ""i love you"""
"and ""you're beautiful"""
now that the wait is over
and love and has finally shown her my way
marry me
today and every day
marry me
if i ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
say you will
mm-hmm
say you will
mm-hmm
promise me
you'll always be
happy by my side
i promise to
sing to you
when all the music dies
marry me
today and everyday
marry me
if i ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
say you will
i will
come on say you will
you know i will
marry me
"she said i don't recall seeing you around here,"
you must be new to this town.
said i'm just passing through but girl from the looks of you i could
see me settlin'down
"then she smiled and said the invitations open,"
cause you look just like what i've been waitin' on.
so i said why don't me take this matter somewhere else
"and get to know this feelin' that's so strong, lead on."
"she said i had a love once, but he just up and left me,"
i said i bet it broke heart.
"i had a love once too but i acted like a fool,"
oh what i'd give to be back in her arms.
"then she smiled and said the invitations open,"
cause you look just like what i've been waitin'on
so i said why don't we take this matter somewhere else
"and pick up where everything went wrong, lead on."
"she said i don't recall seeing you around here,"
you must be new to this town.

last night i had the strangest dream
i ever dreamed before
'cause i dreamed the world
had all agreed to put an end to war
i dreamed i saw a mighty room
filled with women and men
and the papers they were signing said
they'd never fight again
and when the papers were all signed
and a million copies made
they all joined hands and they bowed their heads
and grateful prayers were prayed
and the people in the streets below
were dancing 'round and 'round
and swords and guns and uniforms
were scattered on the ground
"i was good at the game, when i had"
"nothin to lose, then you started playin,"
"it changed all of the rules,"
"i stole my share of good hearts in the night, then vanished before the dawn,"
"and for the first time in my life, i know exactly what i want.."
"i wanna kiss you good morning,lets not let this one end in good night, its just the start of our story,"
"and the ending is nowhere in sight,"
"i wanna hold you all night, and the first sign of light,"
"every day for the rest of my life, from now on,"
i wanna kiss you good morning..
"its never been me, to open every door,"
"or leave little notes, or spill my heart on the floor,"
"i wanna cross that secret line, that says now were more than friends,"
"i wanna drink that lovers wine, fall asleep and then..."
"i wanna kiss you good morning, lets not let this one end in goodnight, its just the start of our story, and the ending is"
nowhere in sight
"i wanna hold you all night, and the first sign of light,"
"every day for the rest of my life, from now on,"
i wanna kiss you good morning...
"theres no better way than to start everyday lyin next to the one you love,"
"so baby at night you can close your eyes,"
"and tomorrow when you wake up,well im gonna kiss you good morning,"
"im gonna hold you all night, and the first sign of light,"
"everyday for the rest of my life, from now on,"
"im gonna kiss you good morning, yea yea..."
(spoken)
got a call tonight
sayin' we could still be friends
what a way to say goodbye
what a way to end
they say the darkest hour
is just before dawn
so i'll just hold my head up
and try to sing my song
better love next time
just don't let me lose my mind
all i need's a real friend
to pick me up again
i gotta shake these memories
if there's another chance for me
i'll be lookin' for a sign
won't someone help me find
a better love next time
i could sit around and hurt forever over you
but in my heart i know you're really gone
there must be a reason for the pain i'm goin' through
telling me i'm not where i belong
better love next time
just don't let me lose my mind
all i need's a real friend
to pick me up again
i gotta shake these memories
if there's another chance for me
i'll be lookin' for a sign
won't someone help me find
a better love next time
just as soon as i am strong
i'll be movin' on
to a better love next time
when you're five years old
and you walk downstairs
and catch your parents on the couch
playin' some game
that looks like half-dressed mouth-to-mouth
well it's a shock to your system
and your brain starts spinnin'
and you make yourself a pact
when i grow up
i ain't ever gonna do that
"yes, you will"
if your lucky you will know just how that feels
you step into a pair of shoes
that you swore you'd never fill
you say you won't
"but yes, you will"
'fore long you got
your drivers liscence
and the world seems like it's yours
except for the fact
that you've got to be home by ten of course
and that makes you mad so you throw a fit
and slam the door as you leave the house
"you yell ""when i have kids"
i'm not gonna care
"how late their out"""
well you know how your grandma and grandpa
are happy just sittin' 'round the house
wearin' clothes that are out of date
talkin' 'bout the old days
and draggin' photo albums out
and you sure do love them
but i mean come on now
you won't ever be that way
oh you can say you won't
"but yes, you will"
"each year on mother's day, the rose i wore was red"
but today i'm saying my first prayer
mama's lying on her dyin' bed
"i've just told mama goodbye, mother's day has turned to night"
"like the flowers in may, she withered away"
and my red rose is turnin' white
"this is the dreaded hour, we all must face someday"
yet there's consolation in my heart
she will bloom in the master's bouquet
"i've just told mama goodbye, mother's day has turned to night"
"like the flowers in may, she withered away"
and my red rose is turnin' white
her time has come to go and there's nothin' i can do
only hold her hand and say goodbye
mama's day with her children is through
i've just told mama goodbye and knelt beside her bed
"i heard her say, ""i'll meet you someday"
"where the white roses turn to red"""
this is for my people back home
"we're lighting one up, feel the love"
we wouldn't be here without ya

from the people that i'm still so cool with
and the people that i went to school with
from the boys i ran around and stomped them grounds and broke them rules with
this one's for my family and the way that i was raised
"and now my life's another city, another picture, another stage"
but i hope you know i miss ya
and part of me's still with ya
and no matter where i go or what i do i won't forget ya

friends are never earned they're a gift from the loving god
and they're precious beyond human evaluation
but you dare not take them for granted or they'll lift away like a smoke
and the warmth of their caring will vanish into the chill of the endless nights
most of my friends are unknowns they probably won't even rate an obituary
unless they live and die in a small town
somewhere where nothing much ever happens
but a few of my friends are big people
they'd made the word ring with laughter down to this string of court
they're famous sensitive talented and their names are household words
and yet they're no more precious in god's eyes or in mine
than those wonderful nobodies who live and die in small towns
who is your friend he's someone who warms you with a nod
or with an unspoken word in hard times when you're hurting beyond words
who is your friend he's someone who holds you to her breast
and sighs softly into your hair when no other medicine could possibly stop the pain
a friend is someone who clings his glass against yours
or answers the phone at three in the morning when you're lost
and with a few words of encouragement and concern
makes you realize that you're not really lost at all
friends come in both sexes in all shapes and sizes
the most important thing they have in common is their ability
to share with you your most sky splitting joys
or your deepest most spelling ol' some sorrows for they're all your friends
sometimes her morning coffee's way too strong
and sometimes what she says she says all wrong
but right or wrong she's there beside me
like only a friend would be
and thats close enough to perfect for me
now she's been known to wear her pants too tight
and drinking puts her out just like a light
"heaven know's she's not an angel, but she'd really like to be"
and that's close enough to perfect for me
she kisses me each morning
and smiles her sleepy smile
and she don't have to say it
i can see it in her eyes
don't you worry about my woman
or what you think she ought to be
'cause she's close enough to perfect for me
well sometimes she gets down and starts to cry
but then again a lady has a right
"she's everything i ever wanted, she's all i'll ever need"
she's close enough to perfect for me
"oh, she's close enough to perfect for me"
when you see a deer
you see bambi
and i see antlers up on the wall
when you see a lake
you think picnics
and i see a large mouth up under that log
you’re probably thinking that you’re gonna change me
"in some ways well, maybe you might"
scrub me down dress me up
but no matter what
remember i’m still a guy
when you see a priceless french painting
i see a drunk naked girl
you think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
and i’d like to give it a whirl
love makes a man do some things he ain’t proud of
and in a weak moment i might walk your sissy dog
hold your purse at the mall
but remember i’m still a guy
and i’ll pour out my heart
hold your hand in the car
write a love song that makes you cry
then turn right around
knock some jerk to the ground
‘cause he copped a feel as you walked by
i can hear you now talking to your friends
saying yeah girls he’s come a long way
from dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
and building a fire in a cave
but when you say a backrub means only a backrub
then you swat my hand when i try
well now what can i say at the end of the day
"honey, i’m still a guy"
and i’ll pour out my heart
hold your hand in the car
write a love song that makes you cry
then turn right around
knock some jerk to the ground
‘cause he copped a feel as you walked by
these days there’s dudes getting facials
manicured waxed and botoxed
but with deep spray on tans and creamy lotioney hands
you can’t grip a tackle box
with all of these men lining up to get neutered
it’s hip now to be feminized i don’t highlight my hair
i’ve still got a pair
"yeah, honey i’m still a guy"
my eyebrows ain’t plucked
theres a gun in my truck
thank god i’m still a guy
last night i was pouring out my heart
like a waterfall to you
"and with a one kiss, i was a runaway train"
flying off the track to you
i love you came flooding out
"couldn't make it stop, couldn't shut my mouth"
felt like a fool then i lied and said i was sorry.
"but i unapologize, meant every word"
won't take back the way i feel about you
can't unsay what you heard
cause you heard me right
and i won't try to fight them back or hide my feelings for you
i unapologize
you know people say a lot of things that they don't really mean
and last night i told a little white lie
hoping you'd forget the scene
where it felt like a movie under that porch light
couldn't help myself when you held me tight
said what i meant then i lied and said i was sorry
"but i unapologize, meant every word"
won't take back the way i feel about you
can't unsay what you heard
cause you heard me right
and i won't try to fight them back or hide my feelings
for you
i unapologize
oh there's no time to be holding it out and trying to pretend
that i don't feel anything
oh i shouldnt have said i'm sorry
i meant every word won't take back the way i feel
about you
can't unsaid what you heard
cause you heard me right
and i won't try to fight them back or hide my feelings for you
i unapologize
"cause you heard me right, yeah"
"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
i unapologize
it's twilight and the streetlights arecoming on
i'm in a stream of cars on this boulevard headed home
i can hardly wait for you to make what went wrong today
seem right
it's been a long hard day so bring on the night
bring on the night
pull down the shades
lock the world outside and throw the key away
turn on the feeling and turn out the lights
let's call it a day and bring on the night
from nine to five it's the same old grind all week long
and the only thing that keeps me sane is coming home
when the sun goes down you know how to set thing right
let's put the day behind us and bring on the night
let's call it a day and bring the night
empty blue shoes
and empty brown bottles
it's the vw blues
bare feet to the floor
you just might die
when you make colorado
and the plaines lie behind you
sweet texas behind you
and your mother won't hold
you forever
and forever won't hold you for long
and that girl with the face of
an angel
she's the girl with the face that's
long gone
now those empty blue shoes
they sit by the highway
and those vw blues
they saw 'em pulling away
you know she kissed me goodbye
the last time i saw her
but what she intended
she never would say
and you lover won't hold you
forever
and forever won't hold you for long
and that girl with the face of
an angel
she's the girl with the face that's
long gone
"you can turn me loose, tear me up and run me down"
"cause me shame, drag my name all over town"
makes no difference what you say or what you do
as for me i'll always be lovin' you
my love for you was not built on shifting sands
i made a promise long ago and it still stands
go on and do what your heart tells you to
as for me i'll always be lovin' you
"you can change your dreams, change your heart"
or change your mind
and just pretend that it all ends with your goodbye
you can walk out and forget the love we knew
as for me i'll always be lovin' you
well she puts her dancing shoes on every night
and comes alive there in the smoke beneath the neon lights
and she don`t like those hurtin songs
cause she is already lived æ...¹m
"she don`t get the blues, she gives æ...¹m"
well she checks her broken heart there at the door
"she ainæš° looking for romance, sheæš¯ danced that dance before"
well i pity the next poor fool that gets caught up in her rhythm
"cause she donæš° get the blues, she gives æ...¹m"
sheæš¯ been on the losing end of love too many times
and she ainæš° gonna go for anything youæš³e got in mind
so before you start let me impart
these few words of wisdom
"she donæš° get the blues, she gives æ...¹m"
sheæš¯ been on the losing end of love too many times
and she ainæš° gonna go for anything youæš³e got in mind
so before you start let me impart
these few words of wisdom
"she donæš° get the blues, she gives æ...¹m"
"no she donæš° get the blues, lord she gives æ...¹m"
"we live in two different worlds, dear"
that's why we're so far apart
you made your world out of vows that are broken
i built a world in my heart
everyone here tried to warn me
you were just playing a game
"i told them all, we were meant for each other"
i thought our worlds were the same
if you stay over in your world
"oh, how my poor heart will pine"
"darling, someday when your memories wander"
won't you come over in mine
"we live in two different worlds, dear"
my world is honest and true
"sweetheart, remember when your world gets lonesome"
i'll still be waiting for you
"firecracker, i heard you callin' me"
"firecracker, that suits me to a t"
"a tiny stick of dynamite, laced with tnt"
"i'm a firecracker, hot as i can be"
"now, i'll explode if you insist on lightin' up my fuse"
if you ignore the danger of breakin' all my rules
a ragin' fire can be ignited from a tiny spark
"if you don't pay attention, all hell can blow apart"
"i'm full of fire and passion, wound tight and aim to please"
"but if you wanna play with fire, be mindful and take heat"
standin' up for who i am and all that i believe
"is makin' me a firecracker, that's just what i'll be"
"firecracker, if you can't take thе heat"
"firecracker, just stay away from mе"
that pretty much sums it up
so handle cautiously
i'm a hunk-a hunk-a burnin' stuff
and you'll feel the burn from me
thank you very much!
"boom, boom, bang, bang"
"pow, pow, pow"
i will blow up in your face right here and right now
"handle with care, with respectability"
you can lose a finger if you're pointin' it at me!
"firecracker, yeah, you can call me that"
"firecracker, ‘cause i will fight you back"
and i'm not out for trouble
but if it comes around
i'll go at you tooth and nail
there'll be no backin' down
"firecracker, more than proud to be"
"firecracker, that suits me to a t"
"a little stick of dynamite, laced with tnt"
"firecracker, as hot as i can be"
"yodel-lady, yodel-lady, hee-hee, hee-hee, hee-hee"
"boom, boom, bang, bang"
"pow, pow, pow"
i will blow up in your face right here and right now
"firecracker, handle cautiously"
"firecracker, now, don't you mess with me"
"firecracker, full of tnt"
"firecracker, just as hot as i can be"
firecracker
"hey, don't you mess me ‘cause i'm full of p and v"
"firecracker, yodel-lady, yodel-lady"
"firecracker, a little stick of dynamite full of tnt"
"frickercracker, hey, don't you mess, don't you mess"
don't you mess with me
yesterday is gone gone but tomorrow is forever
take my hand and run with me out of the past called yesterday
and walk with me into the future of tomorrow
yesterday must be forgot no looking back no matter what
there's nothing there but mem'ries that bring sorrow
yesterday is gone gone but tomorrow is forever
no more crying tears leave tracks and mem'ries find their way back
tomorrow's watin' let's journey there together
yesterday is gone gone but tomorrow is forever
i care not for yesterday i love you as you are today
yesterday just helped to pass the time while waiting
we must forget the passing time my love for you is the real kind
the kind that won't hurt you no never
yesterday is gone gone but tomorrow is forever
yesterday is gone gone but tomorrow is forever

when it's sunny in seattle and it's snowing down in new orleans
"baby, i don't mind you askin"
if there's gonna come a day
when i say goodbye
"maybe, i guess anything could happen"
buts it's as close to never
as your ever gonna find
when it's sunny in seattle and it's snowing down in new orleans
and them boys from amarillo stop wearin those boots and jeans
when there's no tequila in mexico
that's when i'm gonna let you go
when it's sunny in seattle and it's snowing down in new orleans

when new york is a one horse town
that's when i wont need ya around
when it's sunny in seattle
and it's snowing down in new orleans
when it's sunny in seattle
and it's snowing down in new orleans
i left my old home in the mountains
and the only friends i ever had
and while i rambled this world over
my heart felt so lonely and sad
iâ€™m going back to the old home
back to the place i love so well
where the sweet waters flow and the wildflowers grow
back to the old home on the hill
i know that dear old motherâ€™s waiting
waiting alone on that hill
with the silver in her hair and a twinkle in her eye
in the old cabin home on the hill
years have gone by since i saw her
iã‚â€™ve traveled many a mile
but tonight thereâ€™s a light in the window
and sheâ€™s waiting at the door with a smile
i see christian pilgrims so redeemed from sin
called out of darkness a new life to begin
were you ever in the valley when the way is dark and dim
did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him
did you ever have them laugh at you and say it was a fake
the stand that you so boldly for the lord did take
did you ever have them mock at you and say in ways quite grim
did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him
oh my friends 'tis bitter sweet while here on earthly sod
to follow in the footsteps that our dear savior trod
to suffer with the savior and when the way is dark and dim
to think of the bitter cup of loneliness with him
saw a man in the movies
who didn't have a heart
how i wish i could give him mine
then i wouldnt have to feel
it breakin all apart
and this emptiness inside
would suit me fine
its time like these
i wish i were the tin man
you could hurt me all you wanted
and i'd never even know
and i'd give anything
just to be the tin man
then i wouldn't have a heart
and i wouldn't need a soul
i couldn't see your leavin coming
it took me by surprise
even now still seems like a dream
but i know i cant be dreaming
cause as i lay down each nite
the pains so great that it won't let me sleep
its time like these
i wish i were the tin man
you could hurt me all you wanted
and i'd never even know
and i'd give anything
just to be the tin man
and i wouldn't have a heart
and i wouldn't need a soul
i'd give anything
just to be the tin man
and i wouldnt have a heart
and i wouldn't miss you so
i can't sleep
ain't no sleep a coming i'm just lying here thinking 'bout you
i'm in deep
falling deep into the picture in my mind of everything we're gonna do
over at the lake and odwn by the river you can feel it start to rise
"wanna jump in my car, go wherever you are"
'cause i need you by my side
it's gonna be a long hot summer
we should be together with your feet up on the dashboard now
singing along with the radio it's such a beautiful sound
and when you say my name in the middle of the day
i swear i see the stars come out
and when you hold my hand in the back of my mind
i'm just a waiting on the sun to go down
the sun to go down
i wanna see
your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
i gotta be
the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
one chance meeting you were walking by me on the street and i said hi
and that was the beginning of my heart spinning like these wheels in my head tonight
it's gonna be a long hot summer
we should be together with your feet up on the dashboard now
singing along with the radio it's such a beautiful sound
and when you say my name in the middle of the day
i swear i see the stars come out
and when you hold my hand in the back of my mind
i'm just a waiting on the sun to go down
the sun to go down
the only place that i wanna be is where you are
'cause any more than a heartbeat away is just too far
it's gonna be a long hot summer
we should be together with your feet up on the dashboard now
singing along with the radio it's such a beautiful sound
and when you say my name in the middle of the day
i swear i see the stars come out
and when you hold my hand in the back of my mind
i'm just a waiting on the sun to go down
the sun to go down
it's gonna be a long hot summer
we should be together oh
all i really want is more than this moment right now
'cause when you say my name in the middle of the day
i swear i see the stars come out
and when you hold my hand and i look into your eyes
i swear it looks like you're waiting on the sun to go down
the sun to go down
oh and i swear it looks like you're waiting on the sun to go down
"oh whoa, oh, waiting on the sun to go down"
i can't sleep
i'm just lyin' here thinkin'bout you
chestnuts roasting on an open fire
jack frost nipping at your nose
yuletide carols being sung by a choir
and folks dressed up like eskimos
everybody knows a turkey and some missletoe
help to make the season bright
tiny tots with eyes all aglow
who find it hard to sleep tonight
they know that santa's on his way
he's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
and every mother's child is gonna spy
to see if reindeer really know how to fly
and so i'm offering this simple phrase
to kids from one to ninety-four
"although it's been said many times, many ways"
merry christmas
merry christmas
merry christmas to you
"come they told me, pa rum pa pum pum"
"our newborn king to see, pa rum pa pum pum"
"our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pa rum rum"
"to lay before the king, pa rum pa pum pum"
"rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum"
"so to honor him, pa rum pa pum pum"
when we come.
"baby jesus, pa rum pa pum pum"
"i am a poor boy, too, pa rum pa pum pum"
"i have no gift to bring, pa rum pa pum pum"
"that's fit to give a king, pa rum pa pum pum"
"rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum"
"shall i play for you, pa rum pa rum rum"
on my drum.
"mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum"
"the ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum"
"i played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum"
"i played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum"
"rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum"
"then he smiled at me, pa rum pa pum pum"
me and my drum
i want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife
who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high
well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
"and she said, ""mama, i've got a note here from the harper valley pta"""
"well the note says ""mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high"
it's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
"now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way"""
"and it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta"
well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon
"and boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room"
and as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to say
"she said ""i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta"
now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
and mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
and mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
and shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down
now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again
and if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
and then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit
well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley hypocrits
"now i wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way"
that day my mama socked it to the harper valley pta
that day my mama socked it to 'em at the harper valley pta
just the other night a hometown football game
my wife and i ran into my old high school flame
and as i introduced them the past came back to me
and i couldn't help but think of the way things used to be
she was the one that i'd wanted for all times
and each night i'd spend prayin' that god would make her mine
and if he'd only grant me this wish i wished back then
i'd never ask for anything again
sometimes i thank god for unanswered prayers
remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
that just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
some of god's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
she wasn't quite the angel that i remembered in my dreams
and i could tell that time had changed me
inn her eyes too it seemed
we tried to talk about the old days
there wasn't much we could recall
i guess the lord knows what he's doin' after all
and as she walked away and i looked at my wife
and then and there i thankedd the good lord
for the gifts in my life
sometimes i thank god for unanswered prayers
remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
that just because he may not answer doesn't mean he don't care
some of god's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
some of god's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...
some of god's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

grandma burned the biscuits
nearly took the house down with ’em
now she’s in assisted living
we all knew that day would come
we knew she was too gone to drive
the day she parked on i-65
found her on the shoulder cryin’
she didn’t know where she was
it’s like her mind just quit
oh but bring up grandpa
it’s like someone flipped a switch
front porch light and a blue desoto
a couple of straws and a coca cola
you can see it all goin’ down
a handsome boy in army green
"a tear on his face,"
"down on a knee, shaky voice, a diamond ring"
she’ll put you in that town
tomorrow she won’t remember what she did today
"but just ask her ‘bout ellsworth, kansas, 1948"
she takes out his medals
a cigar box of letters
sits and scatters pictures
black and whites of days gone by
we started losin’ her when she lost him
but to hear her carry on
you’d swear she’s seventeen again
football games and leaves a'cracklin’
walkin’ her home in his letter jacket
you can see it all goin’ down
a perfect night on a front porch glider
saying goodnight for the next three hours
her tired eyes go wide and bright
when she talks about that town
tomorrow she won’t remember what she did today
"but just ask her ‘bout ellsworth, kansas, 1948"
while the world is fading all around her
sharing a sundae at the counter
he’s going on and on about her
but she’s right there right now
tomorrow she won’t remember what she did today
"just ask about ellsworth, kansas, 1948..."
you better watch out
you better not cry
you better not put i'm tellin' you why
santa claus is coming to town
he's making a list and checkin' it twice

he knows when you're awake
he knows if you've been bad or good
so be good for goodness sake
o you better watch out

you better not put i'm tellin' you why
santa claus is coming to town
with little tin horns
and little toy drums
"rutty toot, toots and rummy tum, tum"
santa claus is coming to town
with curly head dogs to cuttle and hug
"elephants, ropes, and kitty card to"
santa claus is coming to town
the kids and girl and boy land

there gonna fill the toy lad all around with christmas trees
so you better watch out
you better not cry
you better not put i'm tellin' you why
santa claus is coming
santa claus is coming to town
i know it's gonna take some time
for you to trust this love of mine
i know he broke your heart in two
you've been betrayed and... your afraid
that i will do the same to you
but you'll be safe here in my arms... forever and a day
though you don't believe me now... i'll never walk away
you... you know that i'll be there... when tomorrow comes
(your the only one)
i know you've heard this all before
(your the only one)
your the one that i adore
(your the only one)
you make me shine just like the sun
(your the only one)
you bring this heart of mine undone
(your the only one)
for evry lie you've ever heard
you can believe my every word... yes you can
whatever heaven holds in store
through good and bad... i'll be your man
stand beside you through it all
but you'll be safe here in my arms... forever and a day
though you don't believe me now... i'll never walk away
and you... you know that i'll be there... when tomorrow comes
(your the only one)
i know you've heard this all before
(your the only one)
your the one that i adore
(your the only one)
you make me shine just like the sun
(your the only one)
you bring this heart of mine undone
(your the only one)
i know you've heard this all before
(your the only one)
but your the one that i adore
(your the only one)
you make me shine just like the sun
(your the only one)
you bring this heart of mine undone
(your the only one)
(your the only one)
make me shine just like the sun... yes you do
"if there ever was an angel, then surely you must be one"
if there ever was a perfect love when i look at you i see one
"if there's heaven on earth, then this must surely be"
and i want you to be the last one to touch me
the last thing i remember before i go to sleep
is the touch of your sweet lips softly kissing me
and i go to sleep athinking how happy you make me
and i want you to be the last one to touch me
and when it's time to lay me down for my eternal sleep
once more let your fingers softly touch my cheek
"if i know that you have touched me, then i can sleep in peace"
and i want you to be the last one to touch me
and when the night is over and time will be no more
they say that we shall meet again upon the golden shore
and so when i awaken from my eternal sleep
i want you to be the first one to touch me
"i want you to be the first, the last, the only one to touch me"
every time my ship comes in
a hurricane blows it out again
stormy weather seems to hang around my door
my sweet bird of paradise
flew the coop on me last night
"oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour"
i got a letter from the i.r.s
"they said, son, you're in a hell of a mess"
our computer shows you owe ten-thousand more
that machine's made a bad mistake
'cause that's more than this poor boy makes
"oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour"
every time it rains i just wash my car
the whole neighbourhood goes
swimmin' in my front yard
"well, my mother-in-law says she's"
stayin' three weeks more
"oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour"
just got my car out of the shop
two blocks down the street it stopped
i went to use the telephone at the grocery store
i walked back to my chevrolet
but they towed that sucker away
"oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour"
every time it rains i just wash my car
the whole neighbourhood goes
swimmin' in my front yard
"well, my mother-in-law says she's"
stayin' three weeks more
"oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour"
"well, every time it rains, lord don't it pour"
daddy was an old time preacher man
he preached the word of god throughout the land
he praeached so plain a child could understand
yes daddy was an old time preacher man
he told the people of the need to pray
he talked about god's wrath on judgement day
he preached about that great eternity
he breathed hell so hot that you could feel the heat
daddy was an old time preacher man and leona would get up to testify
and we'd sing in the sweet by and by then we'd sing i'm on my way to canaan land
yes daddy was an old time preacher man
revivals and camps meetin's with four weeks
folks came from all around to hear him preach
daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
but the aisles were allways filled at altar calls
daddy was an old time preacher man...
daddy worked for god but asked no pay for he believed that god provides away
we never had a lot but we got by yes it's cause the lord was on my daddy's side
daddy was an old time preacher man
in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
i'm on my way to canaan's land yes daddy was an old time preacher man
in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
i'm on my way to canaan land yes daddy was an old time preacher man
"livin' on empty, lovin' on fumes"
trying to hold it all together with whiskey and glue
like we've been on pause too long
need to find the resume
"livin' on empty, lovin' on fumes"
"when the honeymoon ends, real life moves in"
"you wake up in the mornin', sometimes it's coffee and gin"
hard to keep it all runnin' smooth
stuck in that day-to-day groove
"livin' on empty, lovin' on fumes"
"yeah, livin' on empty, lovin' on fumes"
trying to hold it all together with whiskey and glue
like we've been on pause too long
need to find the resume
"livin' on empty, lovin' on fumes, yeah"
"so you keep on poundin', like a hammer to the stone"
"yeah, you keep on swingin' till the rock is all gone"
you just do the best you can do
and maybe that sky will turn a little blue
"livin' on empty, lovin' on fumes"
"yeah, we're livin' on empty, lovin' on fumes"
trying to hold it all together with whiskey and glue
like we've been on pause too long
need to find the resume
"livin' on empty, lovin' on fumes"
you both love each other
lord knows that you do
"but you're livin' on empty, lovin' on fumes"
"yeah, you're livin' on empty, lovin' on fumes"
trying to hold it all together with whiskey and glue
like we've been on pause too long
need to find the resume
"livin' on empty, lovin' on fumes"
"yeah, livin' on empty and lovin' on fumes"
i'm a honky tonk night time man i can't stand no light
i'm a honky tonk night time man i can't stand no light

i had the blues this morning i had the blues all day today
but when the sun goes down i'm gonna tuck my blues away away
[ guitar ]

how many roads must a man walk down
before you call him a man?
"yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail"
before she sleeps in the sand?
"yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly"
before they're forever banned?
"the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,"
the answer is blowin' in the wind.
how many times must a man look up
before he can see the sky?
"yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have"
before he can hear people cry?
"yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows"
that too many people have died?
"the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,"
the answer is blowin' in the wind.
how many years can a mountain exist
before it's washed to the sea?
"yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist"
before they're allowed to be free?
"yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head,"
pretending he just doesn't see?
"the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,"
the answer is blowin' in the wind.
i've got a couple more years on you baby that's all
i've had more chances to fly and more places to fall
that's not that i'm wiser it's just that i've spent
more time with my back to the wall
and i've picked up a couple more years on you baby that's all
i've walked a couple more roads than you baby that's all
and i'm tired of running while you're only learning to crawl
and you're going somewhere but i've been to somewhere
and found it was nowhere at all
and i've picked up a couple more years on you baby that's all
[instrumental]
saying goodbye girl don't ever come easy at all
but you've got to fly cause you're hearin' them young eagles call
someday when you're older you'll smile at a man strong and tall
and say i've got a couple more years on you baby that's all
you'll say i've got a couple more years on you baby that's all
i've had more chances to fly and more places to fall
that's not that i'm wiser it's just that i've spent
more time with my back to the wall
"it's the kind of night that's so cold, when you spit"
it freezes before it hits the ground
"and when a bum asks for a quarter, you give a dollar"
"if he's out tonight, he must be truly down"
and i'm searching all the windows for a last minute present
to prove to you what i said was real
for something small and frail and plastic baby
'cause cheap is how i feel
"half a moon in the sky tonight, bright enough"
to come up with an answer
"to the question, why is it that every time i see you"
my love grows a little stronger
but your memory leaves my stomach churning
feeling like a lie about to be revealed
but i'll horde all this to myself
'cause cheap is how i feel
"it's not the smell in here that gets to me, it's the lights"
how i hate the shadows that they cast
and the sound of clinking bottles is the one sure thing
i'll always drag with me from my past
"i think i'll find a pair of eyes tonight, to fall into"
and maybe strike a deal
"your body for my soul, fair swap"
'cause cheap is how i feel
billy never made the football team
cause billy's size was small
but billy's brother was a mighty lad
and played a lot of highschool ball
and billy's daddy never favored him
he catered to the bigger guys
but later on in a bigger way
billy overcame his size
the years flew by and billy grew
but he never got very big
we called him shorty but he never got mad
he was always good for a dig
and we paid no mind when he fell in line
and left with the other guys
and the sargent laughed at his skinny frame
but billy overcame his size
billy overcame his size
yeah billy overcame his size
later on in a bigger way
bill overcame his size
billy's brother made a football star
and the biggest man in town
and the scholarship that kept him home
never seemed to bring him down
but on the other hand his brother bill
put pride in his daddy's eyes
when he died to save those other men
billy overcame his size
billy overcame his size
billy overcame his size
when he died to save those other men
billy overcame his size
"eyed it, dried it, untied it"
"chilled it, spilled it, refilled it"
"taste it, traced it, erased it"
he's my post to lean on
and i just cut him down
so i'm out to land on somethin'
hopefully a boy will come to me at the ground
"eyed it, dried it, untied it"
"chilled it, spilled it, refilled it"
"taste it, trace it, erased it"
he's my post to lean on
and i just cut him down
so i'm out to land on somethin'
hopefully a boy will come to me at the ground
he's my post to lean on
and i just cut him down
so i'm out to land on somethin'
hopefully a boy will come to me at the ground
man you better let go
you can't hold on to
what belongs to me
and don't belong to you
i caught you looking
with your roving eye
so mister you don't have to act
so surprised
if it's her you want
i don't care about that
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
i grew up lonesome
on the open range
and that cold north wind
can make a man feel strange
my john b. stetson
was my only friend
and we've stuck together
through many a woman
so if it's her you want
i don't care about that
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
my mama told me
son to be polite
take your hat off
when you walk inside
but the winds of change
they fill the air
and you can't set your hat down
just anywhere
so if you plead not guilty
i'll be the judge
we don't need no jury
to decide because
i wear a seven
and you're out of order
'cause i can tell from here
you're a seven and a quarter
but if it's her you want
i don't care about that
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
if it's her you want
i don't care about that
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
no it never complains
and it never cries
and it looks so good
and it fits just right
but if it's her you want
i don't care about that
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
"here i am, oh here i am, here i am"
if you need a love that's true
need someone to stand by you
"here i am, oh here i am, here i am"
if you need a helping hand
need someone to understand
"here i am, oh here i am, here i am"
"here i am, i'm reaching out"
to give you love that you're without
i can help you find what you've been looking for
"here i am, come to me"
take my hand 'cause i believe
i can give you all the love you need and more
"oh here i am, oh here i am, here i am"
my world is such an empty place
i need someone to fill the space
"and here i am, oh here i am, here i am"
'cause i've got so much love to give
i need someone to share it with
"and here i am, oh here i am, here i am"
"here i am, i'm reaching out"
to give you love that you're without
i can help you find what you've been searching for
"here i am, come to me"
take my hand 'cause i believe
i can give you all the love you need and more
"oh here i am, oh here i am, here i am"
"oh here i am, oh here i am, here i am"
"here i am, oh here i am, here i am"
i hope you never lose your sense of wonder
you get your fill to eat
but always keep that hunger
may you never take one single breath for granted
god forbid love ever leave you empty handed
i hope you still feel small
when you stand beside the ocean
"whenever one door closes, i hope one more opens"
promise me you'll give faith a fighting chance
and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
i hope you dance
i hope you dance
i hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
never settle for the path of least resistance
living might mean taking chances
but they're worth taking
lovin' might be a mistake
but it's worth making
don't let some hell bent heart
leave you bitter
when you come close to selling out
reconsider
give the heavens above
more than just a passing glance
and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
i hope you dance
(time is a wheel and constant motion always)
i hope you dance
(rolling us along)
i hope you dance
(tell me who)
i hope you dance
(wants to look back on their youth and wonder)
(where those years have gone)
i hope you still feel small
when you stand by the ocean
"whenever one door closes, i hope one more opens"
promise me you'll give faith a fighting chance
and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
dance
i hope you dance
i hope you dance
(time is a wheel and constant motion always)
i hope you dance
(rolling us along)
i hope you dance
(tell me who)
(wants to look back on their youth and wonder)
i hope you dance
(where those years have gone)
(tell me who)
i hope you dance
(wants to look back on their youth and wonder)
(where those years have gone)

walkin' with my honey down by the water green green green
spring is in the air but we're doin' what we order
i'm just a poor boy she's the banker's daughter green green green
nights are warm and sun is in the valley green green green
nights are warm and sun is in the valley
warm and sweet were kisses from my sally green gren green
love made us warm and we really shouldn't tarry green green green
love made us warm and we really shouldn't tarry
cause she's only seventeen and not allow to marry green green green
i went to the banker ask him for his daughter green green green
i went to the banker ask him for his daughter
he flew into a rage and he said i couldn't court her green green green
the leaves're fallin' and where is my honey gold gold gold
the leaves're fallin' and where is my honey
curse on that banker and curse on his money gold gold gold
snow is fallin' on the sun and valley gone gone gone
snow is fallin' on the sun and valley i'm worried and sick for my darlin' sally gone gone gone
they pull her body from the freeing water cold cold cold
they pull her body from the freeing water
there beneath the tree lay our baby daughter cold cold cold
diggin' two graves down by the water green green green
diggin' two graves down by the water
one for my true love one for baby daughter green green green
in the world's mighty gallery of pictures
hang the scenes that are painted from life
there's pictures of love and of passion
and there's pictures of peace and of strife
there hang pictures of youth and of beauty
"of old age, and the blushing young bride"
they all hang on the wall
but the saddest of all
are the pictures from life's other side
just a picture from life's other side
someone has fell by the way
a life has gone out with the tide
that might have been happy some day
there's a poor old mother at home
she's watching and waiting alone
just longin' to hear
from a loved one so dear
it's just a picture from life's other side
the first scene is that of a gambler
who had lost all his money at play
and he draws his dead mother's ring from his finger
that she wore long ago on her wedding day
"it's his last earthly treasure, but he stakes it"
and he bows his head that his shame that he might hide
but when they lifted his head
they found he was dead
that's just a picture from life's other side
"now the last scene, is that by the river"
of a heart broken mother and babe
as the harbor lights shine and they shimmer
on an outcast whom no-one will save
and yet she was once a true woman
she was somebody's darlin' and pride
god help her she leaps
for there's no-one to weep
it's just a picture from lifes other side
the next was a scene of two brothers
whose pathways so diff'rent had led
one lived the life of a rich man
the other one begged for his bread
then one night they met on the highway
"""your money or life"", the thief cried"
and then with his knife - took his own brother's life
it's just a picture from life's other side
you think i'm always making
something out of nothing
saying everything is ok
you've always got an answer
before i ask the question
...whatever you say
now we can change the subject
pretend i never brought it up
some old story anyway
later we can work it out
but right now were talked out
....yeah whatever you say
*choirs*
i know you can hear me
but i'm not sure your listening
i hear what your saying
but still there something missing
whether i go whether i stay
right now depends on
whatever you say
you say yes you need me
i know you wouldn't leave me
and this should be enough
to make me stay
and even though i want to
i don't hear i love you
..in whatever you say
*choirs*
i know you can hear me
but i'm not sure your listening
i hear what your saying
but still there something missing
whether i go whether i stay
right now depends on
whatever you say
oh whether i go whether i stay
right now depends on
..whatever you say
...whatever you say
...whatever you say

if you could read my mind love what a tale my thoughts could tell
just like an old time movie about a ghost from a wishing well
in a cast the dark of a fortress strong with chains upon my feet
you know that ghost is me and i won't ever be set free
as long as i'm a ghost that you can't see
if i could read your mind love what a tale your thoughts could tell
just like a paper back novel the kind the drug stores sell
then you reached the part where the heartaches come
the hero would be me but heroes often fail
and you won't read that book again because the ending's just too hard to take
i'd walk away like a movie star who gets burned in a three way script enter no 2
a movie queen to play the scene of bringin' all the good things out in me
but for now love let's be real
i never thought i could feel this way
and i've got to say that i just don't get it
i don't know where we went wrong
but the feelin' is gone and i just can't get it back
if you could read my mind love...
but stories always end and if you read between the lines
you'd know that i'm just tryin' to understand the feelin's that you lack
i never thought i could feel this way and i've got to say that i just can't get it back
well i apologized when i picked her up
said this old truck is just a fixer up
she smiled and said hey that's ok just a couple letters missing from the chevrolet
i pulled out of her country club neighborhood
she was over there looking so damn good
and i was feeling every bit of my side of the tracks
but she took care of that when she pulled out that moon shine
tasted like an apple pie we were wishing and kissing and sipping that stuff
sho' nuff messing me up
till i couldn't tell the moonlight from the stars in her eyes
i never felt so fine caught up in a good time between her
and that apple pie moonshine well we were dancing around in the high beams
her hands in the back pockets of my jeans the radio playing the perfect song
i still think about her every time the thing comes on
and i never forget that first kiss
when a country boy got to hold a real princess i can still taste the cinnamon on her lips
every time i reminisce
its sweeter than moonshine tasting like an apple pie
we were wishing and kissing and sipping that stuff
sho' nuff messing me up
till i couldn't tell the moonlight from the stars in her eyes
"i never felt so fine caught up in a good time between her and that apple pie moonshine yeah,"
i couldn't tell the moonlight from the stars in her eyes i never felt so fine
caught up in a good time between her and that apple pie moonshine
apple pie moonshine
i come to the garden alone
while the dew is still on the roses
"and the voice i hear, falling on my ear"
the son of god discloses.
and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known.
he speaks and the sound of his voice
is so sweet the birds hush their singing
and the melody that he gave to me
within my heart is ringing.
and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known.
i'd stay in the garden with him
'tho the night around me be falling
but he bids me go; through the voice of woe
his voice to me is calling.
and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known...
i've been higher than the high sierra
lower than death valley must be
"i've been right, mostly wrong"
"wrong about you, right about me"
"the way i feel, can't explain"
so much passion turned to pain
the sun still shines most of the time
did you know the sun shines when it rains
i've been cussed and i've been praised
and i've been nothing these days
"but i'll come back, time will see"
"if i'm wrong about you, right about me"

folks back home think i'm a star now when they hear my records play
they say their hometown girl made good and should go long long way
mom wonders why i don't drive back in that big fine car i own
truth is i don't have a car and i'm ashamed to go back home
a pair of false eyelashes and a tube of cheap lipstick
a pair of worn-out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit
these are all of my possessions all i have to my name
and the record played in my hometown is my only claim to fame
i'm so glad that dad can't see me now his favorite little girl
singin' in this dingy place on the wrong side of the world
now i'm glad that i can't see the boy that offered me his name
for i was blind and turned from him in this empty search for fame
a pair of false eyelashes...
yes the record played in my hometown is my only claim to fame
caught in the vice of heaven and earth
he turned his life into a cell
imprisoned by the doubts that hound us all
and the desires that we all know so well
his days he lost to promises
his nights he purged of dreams
and he would wake in the hours before sunrise
and dread the coming of the day
never thought a man could become so desperate
never thought a life could lose so much hope
to tear at the roots around you
as if in manacles or irons or ropes
they say he told his children that all he taught was lost
and that love and pride and honesty
were to be gained at too high a cost
it's been thirty summers that i've spent with him
and i expect thirty more to pass
he is blessed by life in so many ways
that i could never turn my back
but i need just one more reminder
of that man that he used to be
if he would just look deep into my eyes
"and say it's in you my love, that i will find the key"
there's not much a man can do inside a prisoner
just take his mem'ry trips and fights the pain
and a word from home can mean so much to a prisoner
it's been years since that last letter came
not a day goes by that i don't think of mama
and my nights are filled with thoughts of sweet marie
and old friends i ran around with keep on running through my mind
but i just wonder if they ever think of me
i wonder if they know that i'm still living
and still proud to be a part of uncle sam
i wonder if they think i died of hunger
in this rotten prison camp in vietnam
not a day goes by that i don't think of mama
and my nights are filled with thoughts of sweet marie
and i remember daddy sayin' you'll come back a better man
and i just wonder if they ever think of me
oh i just wonder if they ever think of me

"i thought you knew, guess i assumed to much"
"i don't know how, but now wheir so far out of touch"
"and i never planned, to so miss understand"
"but what you needed, you never asked me to give"
and i swear as i live...
i thought you knew my heart was yours
and that we were so together
"that we, would always be"
"i don't believe, you leavin' me is the answer"
i'm not askin' you to let me rush back in and fail again
"i'm askin' for one chance, not to assume"
so i can say and do all the things i thought you knew
so far wheir still so far
from where we know we should be
i'm searching for words
and you haven't heard
i thought you knew my heart was yours
and that we were so together
"that we, would always be"
"i don't believe, you leavin' me is the answer"
i'm not askin' you to let me rush back in and fail again
"i'm askin' for one chance, not to assume"
so i can say and do all the things i thought you knew
i thought you knew
"if there were no words, no way to speak"
i would still hear you
"if there were no tears, no way to feel inside"
i'd still feel for you
and even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart until the end of time
"you're all i need, my love, my valentine"
all of my life
i have been waiting for all you give to me
"you've opened my eyes, and shown me how to love unselfishly"
i've dreamed of this a thousand times before
in my dreams i couldn't love you more
i will give you my heart until the end of time
you're all i need my love my valentine
(la la la la la la la)
and even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart until the end of time
cause all i need is you my valentine
oh the snow flakes fell in silence
over belleau wood that night
for a christmas truce had been declared
by both sides of the fight
as we laid there in our trenches
the silence broke in two
by a german soldier singing
a song that we all knew
though i did not know the language
the song was silent night
then i heard my buddy whisper
"""all is calm, all is bright"""
then the fear and doubt surrounded me
cause i die if i was wrong
but i stood up in my trench
and i began to sing along
then across the frozen battlefield
another's voice joined in
until one by one each man became
a singer of the hymn
then i thought i was dreaming
for right there in my sight
stood the german soldier
neath the falling flakes of white
and he raised his hand and smiled at me
as if seemed to say
here's hoping we both live to see
us find a better way
then the devils clock struck midnight
and the skies lit up again
and the battlefield where heaven stood
was blown to hell again
but for just one fleeting moment
the answer seemed so clear
heaven's not beyond the clouds
its just beyond the fear
"no, heaven's not beyond the clouds"
its for us to find it here
i never once in my life
met someone like you.
i donâ€™t know what
the word blue means as long as iâ€™m with you.
"you fill me so completely,"
through everything you do
"blue is not, a word at all as long as iâ€™m with you"
"most of the time,"
in my past
blue was all i knew.
"but now that were together,"
oh how i love you.
"im so glad i found you,"
you made my dreams come true.
blue is not a word at all as long as iâ€™m with you
"most of the time,"
in my past
blue was all i knew
"but now that were together,"
oh how i love you.
"iâ€™m so glad i found you,"
you made my dreams come true.
georgia georgia the whole day through
just an old sweet song keeps georgia on my mind
(georgia on my mind)
oh georgia georgia a song of you
comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines
other arms reach out to me and other eyes smile tenderly
still in peaceful dreams i see the road that road
leads back to you
ooh georgia oh georgia no peace i find
just an old sweet song keeps georgia on my mind
(georgia on my mind)
other arms reach out to me...
yeah i say an old sweet song keeps georgia on my mind
one foot strands before the crib
the other by the casket
a question formed upon stilled lips
is passed on but never asked
i guess i believe that there's a point
to what we do
but i ask myself is there
something more besides you?
two are born to cross
"their paths, their lives, their hearts"
if by chance one turns away
are they forever lost?
i guess i believe that there's a point
to what we do
but i ask myself is there
something more besides you?
"this morning i awoke,"
the bed warm where it once was cold
small blessings laid upon us
small mysteries slowly unfold
yet i still wonder is there a point
to what we do?
'cause i kind of doubt
that there is something more besides you
although it's hard to find the point
"to what we do,"
do i dare believe that there is
something more besides you?
you got me headed in a new direction
got no reason to turn around
ain't got no looking back or second guessing
it's time to find what love is really all about
go the distance
let our hearts lead us on
all the way to forever tonight
can't resist it
the feelin's way too strong
go the distance this time
the road to love is paved with shiftin' gravel
we may find ourselves on shaky ground
and there ain't no place that these two hearts can't travel
even when we're miles apart together we are bound to
go the distance
let our hearts lead us on
all the way to forever tonight
can't resist it
the feelin's way too strong
go the distance this time
but if we lose our way we can't get lost if we
go the distance
let our hearts lead us on
all the way to forever tonight
can't resist it
the feelin's way too strong
go the distance this time
she was old enough
to know better
and she was strong enough
to be true
and she was hard enough
to know whether
he was smart enough
to know what to do
and you can't resist it
when it happens to you
no you can't resist it
when it happens to you
and you can tell your story
and you can swear it's true
but you can save your lying
for some other fool
and you can't resist it
when it happens to you
no you can't resist it
when it happens to you
she was old enough
to know better
and she was strong enough
to be true
and she was hard enough
to know whether
he was smart enough
to know what to do
and you can't resist it
when it happens to you
no you can't resist it

she moved into my old apartment
that's how we got this whole thing started
she called and said that i had mail waiting there for me
i told her that i'd come and get it
how could i know in just a minute
that i'd be standing face to face with my own destiny
ohh and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
and ohh then i asked her can i see you again
she said yes
and i said wow
and she said when
and i said how about right now
love can't wait
then i asked if she believed in fate
and she said yes
the days flew by just like a fast train
and nothing else has been on my brain
except the thought of how she makes me
the man i wanna be
and she's the one i want for a million reasons
loving her it's just like breathing
it's easy and it obvious
she was made for me
ohh then it happend one night looking in her eyes
ohh and i popped the question
much to my suprise
"so we called the precher, family, and friends"
and nothing's been the same since
she said yes
"loving you the way i do, is against my will"
i keep hanging on
"when i know it's wrong, this love i feel."
"you're with her, i'm with him"
oh what pain this heartache brings
loving you against my will.
"against my will, a flame is burning"
way down deep in my heart
"against my will, this way that i'm feeling"
is tearing me apart.
"you hold her, i hold him"
wishing i didn't want you still
'cause loving you is against my will.
"against my will, a flame is burning"
way down deep in my heart
"against my will, this way that i'm feeling"
is tearing me apart.
"you hold her, i hold him"
wishing i didn't want you still
loving you against my will.
"ah, loving you against my will..."
you've been wearing that crown and tearing me down
it's been a while since you treated me right
you strung me along for far too long
'cause i never gave up the fight
until now
it's gonna hit you hard til you see stars
it's gonna put you through a world of hurt
oh i don't believe in getting even
but getting what you deserve
"oh my, oh my"
mama always told me that i should play nice
she didn't know you when she gave me that advice
i'm through with you
"bottle up the ashes, smash the urn"
i'm through with you
la dee da
i don't wanna be yours just for fun
don't wanna be under your thumb
all i wanna be is done
you crossed the line too many times
i'm gonna put you in your place
"you play with dynamite, don't be surprised"
when i blow up in your face
"oh my, oh my"
mama always told me that i should play nice
but she didn't know you when she gave me that advice
i'm through with you
"bottle up the ashes, smash the urn"
i'm through with you
la dee da
i don't wanna be part of your fun
don't wanna be under your thumb
all i wanna be is done
with your selfish ways
and all the games you play
i'm through with you
and everything you say
mama told me that i should play nice
she didn't know you when she gave me that advice
mama always told me that i should play nice
but she didn't know you when she gave me that advice
i'm through with you
"scatter the ashes, smash the urn"
i'm through with you
la dee da
i don't wanna be your just for fun
don't wanna be under your thumb
all i wanna be is done
all i wanna be is done
i wanna be done

everyone she knows is getting married
all the girls who used to get around
cut their hair up to their shoulders
spend all their sundays sober now
and everyone she knows is having babies
they got tired of fighting with the clock
and her mama's always asking
if she's ever gonna have one
she's bored with all the boys
and the men are too damn old
she's sick of summer love
but the winter's just too cold
she's a marilyn in blue jeans
with a touch of jackie o
she's stuck between seventeen
and everyone she knows
everyone she knows
everyone she knows is buying houses
even though their husbands don't come home
don't call their exes up to fix it
"if they do, they don't admit it, no, no, no"
everyone she knows is getting healthy
she still smokes a couple when she drinks
but the bars are getting harder
they don't ever card her
and she's bored with all the boys
the men are too damn old
she's sick of summer love
but the winter's just too cold
she's a marilyn in blue jeans
with a touch of jackie o
she's stuck between seventeen
and everyone she knows
everyone she knows
she goes out on saturday night
"she comes home late, she don't have to fight"
"and she thinks, ""ain't got it all, but i got it alright"""
and for a minute she's glad that she ain't like
everyone she knows
she's bored with all the boys
the men are too damn old
she's sick of summer love
the winter's just too cold
she's a marilyn in blue jeans

up above me are the skies like the twinkle in your eyes
these things are the colors of the blues
in the mail your letter came the ink and paper looked the same
blue must be the color of the blues
bluebird's singin' in the trees seems to sympathize with me
but he's not singing like he used to do
the pearly waters in the sea feel as cold as you left me
blue must be the color of the blues
[ fiddle ]
there's a rainbow overhead with more blue than gold and red
blue must be the color angels choose
a blue dress you proudly wore when you left to return no more
blue must be the color of the blues
blue days come and blue days go how i feel nobody knows
life is mighty empty without you
there's a blue note in each song that i sing since you are gone
blue must be the color of the blues
way down yonder on the chattahoochee
it gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
we laid rubber on the georgia asphalt
we got a little crazy but we never got caught
down by the river on a friday night
pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
talkin' 'bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women
"never had a plan, just a livin' for the minute"
yeah way down yonder on the chattahoochee
never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
but i learned how to swim and i learned who i was
a lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
i was willin' but she wasn't ready
so i settled for a burger and a grape sno-cone
i dropped her off early but i didn't go home
down by the river on a friday night
pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
talkin' 'bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women
"never had a plan, just a livin' for the minute"
yeah way down yonder on the chattahochee
never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
but i learned how to swim and i learned who i was
a lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
yeah way down yonder on the chattahochee

"from down here, up north and in between"
"but baby it's a shame, 'cause i always feel the same"
when i can't see texas from here
i can't see texas from here
"no matter how i try, it makes me wanna die"
"so if you see me looking down, i'm trying not to show this frown"
'cause i can't see texas from here
i can't say i don't like tennessee
the people here have all been good to me

flying across the desert in a twa
i saw a woman walking across the sand
she been a-walkin' thirty miles en route to l.a.
to get a brown eyed handsome man
her destination was a brown eyed handsome man
milo venus was a beautiful lass
she had the world in the palm of her hand
but she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
to get a brown eyed handsome man
she fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man
way back in history three thousand years
back every since the world began
there's been a lot of good women shed a tear
for a brown eyed handsome man
that's what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man
beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
between a doctor and a lawyer man
her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
a brown eyed handjust like your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man
arrested on charges of unemployment
he was sitting in the witness stand
the judge's wife called up the district attorney
said you free that brown eyed man
you want your job you better free that brown eyed man
way back in history three thousand years
back every since the world began
there's been a lot of good women shed a tear
for a brown eyed handsome man
that's what the trouble is brown eyed handsome man

for i have found my world in you.

"pancho was a bandit boy, his horse was fast as polished steel."
"he wore his gun outside his pants, for all the honest world to feel."
"pancho met his match, you know, on the deserts down in mexico."
"nobody heard his dying words; ah, but that's the way it goes."
"all the federales say,"
they could have had him any day.
"they only let him slip away,"
"out of kindness, i suppose."
"lefty, he can't sing the blues all night long like he used to."
the dust that pancho bit down south ended up in lefty's mouth.

to play your songs for her
and hear her say

i can't take the lonely nights
without your love

such a fool
cause you're the one thing i can't lose
i feel the tears coming

before he ever made the headlines
or won the winston cup
he survived his share of crashes
but he never did give up
the tracks in carolina
where all the pettyâ€™s ran
what kept the motorâ€™s running
way back then were you the fans
he won seven at daytona
it was stp and forty-three
king richard is a legend
and heâ€™s a hero to me
when he wins he waves his hand
to the folks up in the stand
he is dedicated
to all the nascar fans
well i wish this year could last forever
but the race must go on
heâ€™ll hang up his helmet
but he never will be gone
i know heâ€™ll drive forever
in the heart of every fan
and he will be remembered
as the best thatâ€™s ever been
up on the housetop
reindeer pause
out jumps
good old santa claus
down through the chimney
with lots of toys
all for the little ones
christmas joys
"ho, ho, ho"
who wouldn't go?
"ho, ho ho"
who wouldn't go?
up on the housetop
"click, click, click"
down through the chimney
with old saint nick
first comes
the stocking
of little nell
"oh, dear santa"
fill it well
give her a dolly
that laughs and cries
one that will open
and shut her eyes
"ho, ho, ho"
who wouldn't go?
"ho, ho, ho"
who wouldn't go?
up on the housetop
"click, click, click"
down through the chimney
with old saint nick
next comes
the stocking
of little will
"oh, just see"
what a glorious fill
here is a hammer
and lots of tacks
also a ball
and a whip that cracks
"ho, ho, ho"
who wouldn't go?
"ho, ho, ho"
who wouldn't go?
up on the housetop
"click, click, click"
down through the chimney
with old saint nick
if anyone could find the joy that true love brings a girl and boy
we could we could you and i
if anyone could ever say that their true love was here to stay
we could we could you and i
when you're in my arms i know you're happy to be there
and just as long as i'm with you i'm happy anywhere
if anyone could pray each night and thank the lord that all is right
we could we could you and i
when you're in my arms i know...
today i started lovin' you again
and i'm right back to where i've really always been
i got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
then today i started loving you again
what a fool i was to think i could get by
with only these few memories of mine
i should have known the worst was yet to come
and the crying time for me had just begun
cause today i started loving you again
and i'm right back to where i've really always been
i got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
then todayi started loving you again
may god bless and keep you always
may your wishes all come true
may you always do for others
and let others do for you
may you build a ladder to the stars
and climb on every rung
may you stay forever young
"forever young, forever young"
may you stay forever young
may you grow up to be righteous
may you grow up to be true
may you always know the truth
and see the lights surrounding you
may you always be courageous
stand upright and be strong
may you stay forever young
"forever young, forever young"
may you stay forever young
may your hands always be busy
may your feet always be swift
may you have a strong foundation
when the winds of changes shift
may your heart always be joyful
and may your song always be sung
may you stay forever young
"forever young, forever young"
may you stay forever young
i got a feelin' called the blues
oh lord since my baby said goodbye
(hey lord) i don't know what i'll do
all i do is sit and sigh
"oh lord, the last long day she said goodbye"
hey lord i thought i would cry
she'll do me
she'll do you
she's got that kind of lovin'
and lord i love to hear her
when she calls me sweat daddy
such a beautiful dream
i hate to think it's all over
i lost my heart it seems
i've grown so used to you somehow
lord i'm nobody's sugar daddy now
i'm lonesome
i got the lovesick blues
hey i'm in love
i'm in love with a beautiful gal
that's whats the matter with me
hey i'm in love
i'm in love with a beautiful gal
but she don't care about me
hey lord i tried and i tried
to keep her satisfied
but that gal wouldn't stay
and now that she is leavin'
this is all i can say
i'm against the days
when the skies stay bummer-grey
"and the cake just tastes okay, okay"
well i guess i'm anti-yuck
against the stuff that sucks
pulls the life out of your soul
and shuts it down
i'm against the doc
letting good tomatoes rott
being someone that you're not
when you're not
well i guess i'm anti-hate
cause that ain't what it takes
it'ss love that makes
this crazy world go round
"i'm for the sun, i'm for the breeze"
old dogs sleeping at your feet
i'm for the girls with curls and curves
i'm for questions
i'm for freedom
celebrating every season
for the bees and the trees and the dirt
i'm for the birds
i'm for the birds
i'm for the birds
i'm against the notion
of drinking witchy potions
and causing big commotion
you know son
i guess i'm anti-confrontation
i'd rather have a conversation
about nothing in particular at all
i'm against them feelings
the once that get revealing
slamming hearts right in the ceilings
you feel me
and i guess i'm anti-tears
i'd rather sip an ice cold beer
listen to some country music until dawn
"i'm for the sun, i'm for the breeze"
old dogs sleeping at your feet
i'm for the girls with curls and curves
i'm for questions
i'm for freedom
celebrating every season
for the bees and the trees and the dirt
i'm for the birds
i'm for feathers
i'm for wings
i'm for tweedle-deedle-dee-dee-dee
for what its worth
for what its worth
i'm for the birds
i'm for the birds
i'm for the birds
i'm for the birds
i'm for the birds
i'm for the birds
i'm for the birds
tweedle-deedle-dee-dee-dee
tonight i'm alone without you my dear
it seems there's a longing for you still
all i have to do now is sit alone and cry
in our little cabin home on the hill
"oh, someone has taken you from me"
and left me here all alone
just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane
in our little cabin home on the hill
i hope you are happy tonight as you are
but in my heart there's a longing for you still
i just keep it there so i won't be alone
in our little cabin home on the hill
now when you have come to the end of the way
and find there's no more happiness for you
just let you thoughts turn back once more if you will
to our little cabin home on the hill
thirty bucks would fill a tank up
and leave change for some cheap snuff
"we'd be, six-deep in a '97 jeep wrangler, and i ain't gon' lie, ha"
"back then, we knew we were bad"
it didn't matter where the party was at
"mapco, the old railroad track"
"we'd get there slow and hope it all would last, forever"
"spring break tattoo, you knew better"
like the man in the moon that age old sun-setter
"makes the best shine and the world go 'round and 'round, forever"
"so, let the good times roll and don't never"
"let your young grow old, these days around this podunk town"
you'll think about 'em 'til the cows come home
"for now, forever"
"hmm, hmm (hey)"
"i still remember three dollar hill, a slick spot past the old mill"
"we'd be, sittin' stuck in the super swamper, killer quick mud with some marlboro lights"
waitin' on a old timer by the name of joe
"for a, few bucks and some old crow, he'd tow"
hell on the gears but good for the soul
"lordy, lookin' back at them years"
"you know i'd stay in that hole, forever"
"spring break tattoo, you knew better"
like the man in the moon that age old sun-setter
"makes the best shine and the world go 'round and 'round, forever"
"so, let the good times roll and don't never"
"let your young grow old, these days around this podunk town"
you'll think about 'em 'til the cows come home
"for now, forever (hey, hey, woo, woo)"
"oh, don't let your young grow old"
just let the good times roll
these days around this podunk town
"you'll think about 'em 'til the cows come home, oh yeah"
"oh, don't let your young grow old"
just let the good times roll
these days around this podunk town
you'll think about 'em 'til the cows come home
"for now, forever"
"spring break tattoo, you knew better"
like the man in the moon that age old sun-setter
"makes the best shine and the world go 'round and 'round, forever"
"so, let the good times roll and don't never"
"let your young grow old, these days around this podunk town"
you'll think about 'em 'til the cows come home
"for now, forever (oh, yeah, woo)"
"oh, you think about it"
you think about it
"ooh, yes you will (hey)"
oh-oh
hmm-hmm
"take it home, boys"

the fire of the wine and the touch of a man
