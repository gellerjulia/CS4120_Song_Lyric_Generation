an old man cuts his face
but not because the razor's dull
it's from his hands shaking
from the lack of what he's taking
not like an old man's memories
his wrongs are still and forever
hoping mistakes will fade with the sun
"but no surprise, they never do"
hoping mistakes will fade with the sun
they never do at hell's motel
"lord, please spread my wings"
i want to fly away
i don't want to die on the vine
"lord, please smile on me"
i don't want to live forever
but i don't want to die on the vine
never talks about the past
how he could hold a scalpel
mighty hippocratic oath
how he sold himself for naught
he lived when they lived
"and he died when they died, too"
accepting the new sacred calf of the pagans
as we all die on the vine
accepting the new sacred calf of the pagans
that's life in hell's motel
"oh lord, please spread my wings"
i want to fly away
but i don't want to die on the vine
"oh lord, won't you smile on me"
i don't want to live forever
i just don't want to die on the vine
and tonight he'll close his eyes
hoping the sun will rise again
and all will be forgiven
and this was all just a dream
but the walls to the motel are thin
and next door someone's getting beaten
tears for the unknown are seeds that are sown
and we're all on the run
tears for the unknown are seeds that are sown
this ain't life at hell's motel
hell's motel
this ain't life
in hell's motel
since ages now we're caught and occupied
with our basic civil rights denied
"they came to conquer, took our beloved world"
we're left to thrive in sorrow and disgrace
some never knew what freedom was
"now, there's guards everywhere"
someone come!
rise up tomorrow to rectify the injustice being done
raise the noise bring it on
i'll sing it while you're gone
forever and ever
on with this for as long
there won't be another song now or whenever
"but they're flawed, they crave the sound of our melodies"
though exposed to complex things just faint
this way they're rendered helpless easy prey
to be grabbed and bound safely locked away
aldo here's one guy to play the pipe
summons mean tunes that kill
stadium like set up and verified
knock
witching hourglasses
bleed the hissing sands of time
"as this story, gory, a catharsis"
leads toward the quite sublime
we have such sights to show you
enslaved from the start
she captured my heart
i recall our lips trembled a whisper apart
and when she died
i cried to darkened orders
fell fiends of the abyss
(beware their kiss)
sisters of the mist
through split lips of torture
i scream out her name
"clarissa, i miss her"
death's fissure remains
she hangs in thе courtyard
"neath a cold, callous moon"
her bruised nakеd carcass
displayed for the boon
of those who desired her
fiery womb
if tomorrow we burn
tonight we will seal their doom
enslaved from the start
she captured my heart
i recall our lips trembled a whisper apart
so when she died
i cried in darkened corners
fell fiends of the abyss
(beware their kiss)
sisters of the mist
"as guards drunkenly slept, fog crept from dank woods"
"slithering, slathering, beasts understood"
"that starved, vengeful spirits of similar fates"
had answered the prayers i left at their cemetery gates
from the scarred side of midnight
monstrosities came
"clarissa, i wished"
for hellfire to rain
these vehement women
lithe stygian shades
tore through the murk
like a forest of razorblades
"fating, castrating"
each soul to be taken
and freed from my cell
on reaching the gallows
"enshadowed, i fell"
witching hourglasses
bleed the hissing sands within
as the net of retribution passes
leaving nothing breathing in its skin
a waste of good suffering
the coven dispel with the first rites of dawn
"sated they fade, now benign"
"i cut down my bride and cry out, forlorn"
cradling her spent body to mine
then for one rent moment
a miracle spurred from the pain
death lends her back to my fervent embrace
three final words as she slips to oblivion
enslaved from the start
she captured my heart
i recall our lips trembled a whisper apart
and when she died
i cried on darkened shores
"despisal, reprisal for holy fists"
(beware their mephistory)
sisters of the mist
sisters of the mist
now the sun rises on streets steeped in blood
i stagger her corpse to the lake
the feared water wyrds creature up from the mud
to take us to depths far away from the stake
"as the cold waves enclose, i shall falter no more"
nothing is ghosting me back to the shore
and though i have knelt at this altar before
"death will unite us, our nights will be glorious"
"together, victorious"
"and legendary, even in hell"
sadness lives after we die
the pains of life increased outright
contempt and sins priorities
to crush good fortune [to its knees]
morning...
"morning's calm, inside i cry"
this painful live has raped my mind
"take me down, slow release"
from sorrow's penetration
morning...
life is there for me
hell is there for me
sunlight greets my open wounds
morning's light reflects the doom
"my soul is free, it lives again"
to roam alone in darkness
morning...
i've cried for god
and i've cried for you
i pray that in the end your sense will break though
sadness lives after we die
the pains of life increased outright
contest my sins priorities
we met on the streets down somewhere
no place to survive
a look in your eyes signalized me
our prospering love
"we thought it was heaven, never turned into hell"
"but only time tells the truth, the wicked spell"
crying in the night
there's no future for you and i
"living a lie - cold hearted, time to cry"
living a lie - love will never survive
living a lie - endless time of sorrow
living a lie - hopeless life with no tomorrow
(living a lie)
we danced on the edge of anger
even in the pouring rain
never thought that it's time to surrender
all the tears had been drained
"falling down, in and out of love,"
the thoughts had been paralyzed
"you, the heartlessly demon,"
go and get a life
[ad-libs]
"the scream of anger, the pouring rain"
all the tears that you cried
were gone with the wind...
"your heart made of ice, your soul just a stone"
love sucking bitch go and leave me alone
what a day
i can barely keep my eyes wide open
i don't wanna see straight
what a day
feels like my breath is heavy again
and i'm totally faded
come to me
come to me
i am waiting for you
come to me
i can't wait
"follow me, follow me"
as i trip the darkness
one more time
"follow me, follow me"
i awake from madness
just in time
what a day
"seconds, minutes and hours spill over"
there's no time here in space
what a day
i see beauty in everything
but the world is still fading away
come to me
come to me
i am waiting for you
come to me
i can't wait
"follow me, follow me"
as i trip the darkness
one more time
"follow me, follow me"
i awake from madness
just in time
what a day
i can barely keep my eyes wide open
i don't wanna see straight
what a day
"seconds, minutes and hours spill over"
there's no time here in space
"come to me, come to me"
come to me
"come to me, come to me"
"come to me, come to me"
i am waiting for you
"follow me, follow me"
as i trip the darkness
one more time
"follow me, follow me"
i awake from madness
just in time (3x)
i awake from madness
one more time
"i went looking for trouble and boy, i found her"
she's in love with herself
she likes the dark
on her milk white neck
the devil's mark
now it's all hallows eve
the moon is full
will she trick or treat
i bet she will
she will
(happy halloween baby)
she's got a date at midnight
with nosferatu
"oh baby, lilly munster"
ain't got nothing on you
well when i called her evil
she just laughed
and cast that spell on me
boo bitch craft
yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
you can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
dye em black
oh dye em black
black black black black no. 1
black black black black no. 1
little wolf skin boots
and clove cigarettes
an erotic funeral
for which she is dressed
her perfume smells like
burning leaves
everyday is halloween
yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
you can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
dye em black
oh dye em black
black black black black no. 1
black black black black no. 1
loving you was like loving the dead
drifting down what we passed
it's done over and over again
we've just been losing a part
to be in another winning team
we turned the tables and times
reject the failures for the pride
it's a replay or a change
who knows when the new game starts
what have we done
what a deal
we're bound to fail
'cause you failed before
we're bound to fail
'cause you failed before
while you have been so wrong
we have to live by self defence
we are mistaken by you
there is no way we can win
we wanna change it
is it true
we're bound to fail
'cause you failed before
we're bound to fail
'cause you failed before
we wanna change it
what have we done
in the darkness
troubled waters
lies a flicker
of hopes fire
come to your senses
wager a risk
i won't let go
waiting for dreams
its a wonderful reality
i watch as
this golden bired flies free
in this ashvault
a rose garden
these walls will never
see me just to
save me
save me
have you beheld how our ending befell?
we are the catalyst; engineered hell
the depths we've sunken to
the violent things we do
a cleansing tide would eradicate all of you
how did you think when in apathy's drink
that doing nothing would spare you from the brink
you're equally at fault; now broken by the assault
"the righteous, the victims, the villainous ones and all"
i know what you're hiding from
i know what you're hiding from
the waves keep crashing over
"they pummel me, over and over"
i don't think i can ever brave this storm
should we go quietly?
accept that all is lost
i don't think i can ever brave this storm
wash us away in the tides of decay
extinction soon will claim us all as his prey
we're pulled in to the sea; the tempest has been set free
i'm wide awake when the lightning comes beckoning
burn us alive for our sins and our crimes
we are the wretched ones: malevolent slime
existing to consume; everything we once knew
"take us, break us, submerge us inside our tomb"
i know what you're hiding from
i know what you're hiding from
the waves keep crashing over
"they pummel me, over and over"
i don't think i can ever brave this storm
should we go quietly?
accept that all is lost
i don't think i can ever brave this storm
this quest is impossible
brave this storm
i'm feeling my insides pull
brave this storm
i'm being devoured whole
brave this storm
my soul is poured in the world
brave this
the waves keep crashing over
"they pummel me, over and over"
i don't think i can ever brave this storm
should we go quietly?
accept that all is lost
i don't think i can ever brave this storm
the waves keep crashing over
"they pummel me, over and over"
i don't think i can ever brave this storm
should we go quietly?
accept that all is lost
i don't think i can ever brave this storm
candles raise my desire
why i'm so far away
no more meaning to my life
no more reason to stay
"freezing, feeling, breathe-in - breathe in"
i'm coming back again
i'm not the one who's so far away
when i feel the snake bite into my veins
never did i wanna be here again
and i don't remember why i came
hazing clouds rain on my head
empty thought fill my ears
find my shade by the moonlight
why my thoughts aren't so clear
demons dreaming
breathe- in - breathe- in
i'm coming back again
voodoo voodoo (4x)
so far away
i'm not the one who's so far away
i'm not the one who's so far away
i'm not the one who's so far away...
"something for nothing, a bargain, a steal"
"used cars on credit card, lost another wheel"
i'd like to get it for free
it's what the price should be
i just wanna pay less
i just have to confess
"quality and value, always wanting more"
"tip my hat to the taxman, the revenue does poor"
you get what you pay for
cheap and stingy may have its own way
there's a lesson to be learned from being this way
you get nothing for free
you gotta let it be
you know you can't ignore
when you know the score
you get what you pay for
you get what you pay for
get what you pay for
nothing for nothing is the golden rule
"suckers born everyday, don't be left a fool"
you get nothing for free
you get to pay the fee
you know you can't ignore
when you know the score
you get what you pay for
by the ruins he stands
and he's waiting for me
to enter tanelorn
his paths seems strange
but they're always planned
seldom he succeeds
about his own fate
he tries to conquer it
again and again
but at last he's almost
a ruined man
not a king or god
who's searching for
a place called tanelorn
far beyond your dreams
ref.:
on our quest for tanelorn
we lose our way
on our quest for tanelorn
he's waiting
he's waiting for me
he's waiting
he's waiting for me
[spiritus sanctus - vita aeterna]
darkness falling down on me
darkness - the eternal battle rises
i know the answers
although they don't exist
i'm just a mortal illusion
ref.
(solo)
so i'm his companion
through space and through time
his eternal servant
he's calling me
so i must leave
to any life
to another world
far beyond your dreams
to know the truth
just for a while
he's longing for a place
where he can find himself
deliverance
it could be everywhere
how can he find
he's waiting for me
and for your tanelorn
ref.:
on our quest for tanelorn
we lose our way
on our quest for tanelorn
we lose our way
on our quest for tanelorn
we lose our way
on our quest for tanelorn
we're left alone

let's play the big game of life and death
you can throw your dice
i'm not scared as you see...
odd or even: make your choice...
"i'll bet with my life, as i always did!"
this is the big game of life
no winners...
this is my life : black and white
every day i bet on it
and here we go
for this never-ending game
i'm not going to stop
i have nothing to lose
all the sheets are on the table
choose it right or you can lose your dreams....
this is the big game of life
no winners...
this is my life : black and white
every day i bet on it
again you'll let me win
to give me the illusion i can escape the fate
"""you said it right, i like to play"
"but keep it in your mind, you're still mine..."""
this is the big game of life
no winners...
this is my life : black and white
every day i bet on it
"somebody's gonna win,"
"one of a million, one of a kind,"
"so tell me it's a sin,"
i'm pushin' it up and crossin' the line.
"nobody's gonna run, nobody's gonna hide,"
so if you lookin' for trouble - you'd better
stand up and find!
"easy rider - takin' it day by day,"
easy rider - drinkin' the night away.
"easy rider - livin' it day by day,"
easy rider - trouble is on its way.
"since i was a kid,"
"never looked back, never slowed down,"
"ridin' down the street,"
lookin' for one way ticket to the promised land.
"the son of a major, prussian nobleman"
his name bestowed by a holy roman
"the war broke out, so he looked to the air"
24 hours of training and he was there
100 miles an hour
top speed his plane would fly
and if he flew behind you
you know you’re sure to die
80 kills that are confirmed
while other pilots had so much
more to learn
the red baron… blue max
the albatross flies high
the red baron… blue max
he’s got you in his sights
"the red battle flyer, red like fire"
"he sees no faces, he’s the ace of aces"
his british quarry flew a reckless flight
a shot from the ground took the red baron’s life
"he flew with honor, he flew with pride"
in 1918 the battle flyer died
the red baron… blue max
the albatross flies high
the red baron… blue max
he’s got you in his sights
shutting down my mind
no more hurting from everything insane
use every word to blame
makes a deeper cut inside
sensory overload
makes me want to scream and close my eyes
eradicate
never fails to take its place in line
it's not too late to take it all
embrace the pain that breaks me down
shutting myself off
"getting numb inside, what did you just say?"
unconscious and confused
i can't stand the noise outside
even if you think i'm fine
"i'm still damaged, i stay out of sight"
eradicate
never fails to take it's place in line
it's not too late to take it all
embrace the pain that breaks me down
now it's too late
i've take control
i embrace the pain
that keeps breaking me down once more
it's not too late to take it all
embrace the pain that breaks me down
breakdown
breakdown
"just like the rest, you live by words that mean nothing"
"values no one needs. just like the rest, forcing"
"them on us, raping our thoughts"
"try to find the answer on your knees, so stay on your fucking"
knees. murder needs no justification
last seconds of life so sweet in my eyes
hearing words they think will save them
cutting as they cry tears of corruption
the urge to face my captors is overwhelming
to be recognized as the artist that i am
"excitement of new torture, a different perspective"
"of life, the body can endure so much pain"
"tearing, ripping flesh from the bone"
"but death does not come yet, cauterizing aids in that"
perfection takes patience. you knew we'd find out
they always tell
the urge to face my captors is overwhelming
to be recognized as the artist
darkness rises to embrace me
i am a soulless monster with a lack of remorse
as you die i am reborn. so different now
i am unstoppable
"more than man, more than life, more than death"
"you kneel before me, this power i possess"
"you're all nothing to me. after i'm done with you, death will follow"
curse this cold world
cast into the fire. i want to watch us burn
watch us die
there's no end - there's no beginning -
to the old man's story
does he still remember me -
from lives gone by
oh i see his spirit rising
upon the back of time
i've got nowhere to hide
will he keep a place for me
he is the king of all kings
the keeper of light
he holds eternity's wings
in his eyes an ocean's burning
swollen seat of tears
troubled mind the beating
war drums in his ears
no one ever hears his warning
am i the one he calls
when they tell me they're afraid
some say i'll be put away
he is the king of all kings
the keeper of light
he holds eternity's wings
my blood will spill my blood
my blood will spill my blood
in the wisdom of the prophet's
never ending tale
open up the eyes
"within your mind, he says"
crowned in his ancient glory
there's a king within us all
some will say it's all in vain
that he doesn't have a name
he is the king of all kings
the keeper of light
he holds eternity's wings
there's a light in you
that tears me down to nothing
thre's an angel in your eyes
there's a hope inside
that you can make it better
you see right through my disguise
"when it rains, it pours"
and everybody stumbles
i won't let them bring you down
i won't let you down
when the seasons change
i won't go down
i'll fight through the pain
i'll be there right by your side
i'll never let them bring you down
when the seasons change
there's a hope in me
that i will die for something
was there fire in my eyes?
all this pain inside
will it be this way forever?
"i can run, but i can't hide"
"when it rains, it pours"
and everybody stumbles
i won't let them bring you down
i won't let you down
when the seasons change
i won't go down
i'll fight through the pain
i'll be there right by your side
i'll never let them bring you down
when the seasons change
when the seasons change
and we're in for colder weather
look for me on the divide
i won't let you down
when the seasons change
i won't go down
i'll fight through the pain
i'll be there right by your side
i'll never let them bring you down
i won't let you down
when the seasons change
as i travel through the astral plains
i see the break ahead
as though the sky has burst in flames
before the storm i dread
lightning breaks across the sky
blackish blue at night
riders ride on dismal clouds
i scream at heavens light
storming demons travel through the night
the time is almost here
i lay in a jacket of steel
my scream no one hears
i can feel the storm approaching
the pain is its' reality
the death i breathe is in the air
"i feel no more, no longer care"
the trumpets sound as i break free
this vision i see just can't be me
what is this that i have done
why am i the chosen one
"fight on, grab on"
stormrider
stormrider
now the rider rides through the night
the time is almost here
as i lay wrapped in steel
my scream no one hears
"help me, through this hell inside"
"my life's my own, it's my pride"
carry on my solid dream
save me from this horrid scream
"fight on, grab on"
stormrider
stormrider
our lives are fake
"they mean nothing, you see"
our dreams are lost
just a fantasy
how many times have you been misguided?
how many times have your hopes been smited?
this life means nothing to me
"victimized, deceived"
a black veil of insanity's crushing
like fire beating all of our disease
the black veil of insanity misleads
our hearts are free
does that mean anything?
do what we're told
self-seeking hypocrisy
how many times have you been misguided?
how many times have your hopes been smited?
this life means fuck to me
"victimized, deceived"
a black veil of insanity's crushing
like fire beating all of our disease
the black veil of insanity misleads
"black veil, it's coming for me"
"it's coming for me, it's coming for me"
"it's coming for me, it's the black veil"
"of insanity, it's coming for me"
"set free, set free, set free, set free"
"set free, set free, set free, set free"
set free
"victimized, deceived"
a black veil of insanity's crushing
like fire beating all of our disease
the black veil of insanity misleads
i keep this to myself.
witness the end.
fire to ember to ash
time never heals
"i want to believe this will pass,"
but i can't see beyond the black
"i promised forever, but i let go."
from blue to red to black
time never heals
you know that you were right.
so tired i cannot stand
time never heals
i had to run to save myself
time never heals
fire to ember to ash
time never heals...
we were speeding together
down the dark avenues
but besides all the stardom
all we got was blues
but through all the sorrow
we've been riding high
and the truth of the matter is
"i never let you go, let you go"
we were scanning the cities
rocking to pay their dues
but besides all the glamor
all we got was bruised
but through all the sorrow
we've been riding high
and the truth of the matter is
"i never let you go, let you go"
you go down just like holy mary
"mary on a, mary on a cross"
not just another bloody mary
"mary on a, mary on a cross"
if you choose to run away with me
i will tickle you internally
and i see nothing wrong with that
we were searching for reasons
to play by the rules
but we quickly found out
it was just for fools
now through all the sorrow
we'll be riding high
and the truth of the matter is
"i never let you go, let you go"
you go down just like holy mary
"mary on a, mary on a cross"
not just another bloody mary
"mary on a, mary on a"
you go down just like holy mary
"mary on a, mary on a cross"
"your beauty never, ever scared me"
"mary on a, mary on a cross"
if you choose to run away with me
i will tickle you internally
and i see nothing wrong with that
"(mary on a, mary on a cross)"
nothing wrong with that
"(mary on a, mary on a cross)"
nothing wrong with that
"(mary on a, mary on a cross)"
(mary on a) mary on a cross

"please come back and take me away from here"""

the madman roams inside my head
oh. what’s in you now?
oh what’s in you now?
oh what’s in you now?
oh what’s in you now?
helter skelter running through my veins
satan’s coming on his way
helter skelter running through my veins
satan’s coming on his way
oh. what’s in you now?
oh what’s in you now?
oh what’s in you now?
oh what’s in you now?
oh. what’s in you now?
oh what’s in you now?
oh what’s in you now?
in the dark again
that borders to the old imagination
the inside of my soul once again lost my friend
so ashamed of what i've done
all alone again
with nothing but the silent voices screaming
the dark side of my heart
"once again there, my friend"
all my fears are torn apart
talk to me
cause the shadows won't stop haunting me
talk to me
stay by my side to the bitter end
what if we fade like the midnight sun
in the last rays of darkness a journey begun
what if we fall like the april rain
when the last day of sunlight swept the pain away
reaching in again
to the void that i so carefully protected
imaginary friends
"out of reach, safe from harm"
talk to me
cause the shadows won't stop haunting me
talk to me
stay by the side to the bitter end
what if we fade like the midnight sun
in the last rays of darkness a journey begun
what if we fall like the april rain
when the last day of sunlight swept the pain away
talk to me
cause the shadows won't stop haunting me
talk to me
stay by the side to the bitter end
what if we fade like the midnight sun
in the last rays of darkness a journey begun
what if we fall like the april rain
when the last day of sunlight swept the pain away
what if we fade like the midnight sun
in the last rays of darkness a journey begun
what if we fall like the april rain
when the last day of sunlight swept the pain away
"crime is done, i'm alone in the night."
"there's no one to save, and there's no one to fight,"
"now you're gone and i'm just looking around,"
"chasin' shadows and traces in the sky, on the ground."
"i pay for the miracle,"
"father, don't take him away."
"rise up for a miracle,"
save him or don't let me stay...
"such a shame now you're out of my reach,"
"and it hurts, i don't know should i curse, should i preach?"
"play the game - put a gun to your head,"
smile - give me a shot - pull the trigger - you're dead...
"goin' down, you're goin' down all the way,"
down the needle park.
"goin' down, you're goin' down like a little kid,"
lost in the dark...
"last, last goodbye - you'll take yours and i'll take mine."
"dance around candle like a butterfly,"
can you tell me why?
"last, last goodbye - bitter as the silent cry,"
"blowin' out the chance to do a second try,"
just another try...
"day by day, crossin' oceans of pain,"
god i wish i could stop this old runaway train.
"far away like a shadow, a ghost,"
now the magic is gone and the spirit is lost...
"goin' down, you're goin' down all the way,"
down the needle park.
"goin' down, you're goin' down like a little kid,"
lost in the dark...
"last, last goodbye - you'll take yours and i'll take mine."
"dance around candle like a butterfly,"
can you tell me why?
"last, last goodbye - bitter as the silent cry,"
"blowin' out the chance to do a second try,"
just another try...
you need to know what it's like
to be left and crucified
to be stripped and torn to pieces
you just left me there to die
tell me why do you breed
all this hate and misery
is this just another statement of your insecurity?
but now's your chance
you better run for your life
you won't get my sympathy
(i'll hunt you down)
now's your chance
you better run for your life
you won't get my sympathy
(i'll hunt you down)
and i won't let you get away
"you can't escape, your screams can't be heard"
intoxicated by the smell of your fear
you can't hide
so tell me why do you need
all this sad
is this just another statement of your insecurity?
but now's your chance
you better run for your life
you won't get my sympathy
(i'll hunt you down)
now's your chance
you better run for your life
you won't get my sympathy
(i'll hunt you down)
and i won't let you get away

"i've always been the perfect man for fightin',"
i've always been the one who'd never lose.
"get up'n'play - it used to be exciting,"
a chance to win - but there's no excuse.
"but now i feel i've spent my life for nothing,"
no chances left - confusions like a rain.
one step ahead won't help - i'm loosin' something.
another victory will bring another pain...
"and i feel like a stranger - lost and found,"
in the heat of the danger - another time around.
one by one - we're fallin' on the burnin' ground.
one by one - keep movin' round'n'round.
one by one - just fallin' like shootin' stars.
one by one - we'll just rust behind the bars...
"i'm on track, no matter how i'm movin'"
from light to light - another dusty place.
"no one around - aware of what you're doin',"
forgotten hero - an unknown face.
"straight through the heart - no pain, cos there's nothing."
"back to the past - just injuries insight,"
"no way to stop - watch out, cos' evil laughin',"
no use screamin' - it's sinkin in the night.
"take a look in the mirror - see if you're blind,"
keep chasin' the hero - in another time...
"the world's desperated with irony, hunger and corruption"
"the eastern world and the africans, too"
are going to repeat the history of all wars
and our industry supplied them with arms
everybody knows but nobody can do anything against it
the fall of society is on the make
"well sometimes, sometimes i try to draw up a list"
i try to find out what they have done
i thought of honorable murderers you know
like jonah's hand might wrap around us
"and anytime, everywhere in the world ..."
"gamma ray, gamma ray, gamma, gamma, gamma ray,"
made of your existence
"gamma ray, gamma ray, gamma, gamma, gamma ray,"
money and our failing
i've waited for... to fire gamma ray!
without body i could fly around the world
"destroying arms, destroying rockets"
mix all complexions of the whole human race
we all would turn to shallow people
"everybody, everywhere in the whole world"
"gamma ray, gamma ray, gamma, gamma, gamma ray,"
made of your existence
"gamma ray, gamma ray, gamma, gamma, gamma ray,"
money and our failing
i've waited for... to fire gamma ray!

"we've been somatically defiled, exiled"
and now this new era has come to an end
go!
i forever crave the things that will never be changed
i would rather take my own life than wait until the day
"they see everyone, everything"
promising eternal fortune for the price of your life
we ignite the fire for the highest degree of hell
"you bought it with your brain, now you'll forever burn"
now normality cease to be
hopefully you can withstand the thought of being dead
this life
i have never seen such disgust for power and lust
this life
"it's a tragedy, someone get me out"
someone please help tonight
i have realized this is my last night to be alive
this mind
"it begins to see, it begins to breathe, make it bleed"
make it bleed
i forever crave the things that will never be changed
i would rather take my own life than wait until the day
"they see everyone, everything"
promising eternal fortune for the price of your life
we ignite the fire for the highest degree of hell
"you bought it with your brain, now you'll forever burn"
now normality cease to be
hopefully you can withstand the thought of being dead
when it all falls apart
i'll be the one that's standing over your corpse
with my foot on your face embracing
the darkness of your days
"fire and brimstone, sulphur smell"
the home of evil in the depths of hell
cauldrons a-boil with blood and bone
your soul is taken for the devil to own
in hell
toxic air and intense heat
burning embers upon your feet
"drawn and quartered, disembowelled"
when serving satan is what you've vowed
fire's burning in hell
in hell
tortured souls must pay the price
victims of their own device
banished to this forsaken place
to stare upon the demon's face
fire's burning in hell
in hell
severed limbs and burned out eyes
no one cares and no one cries
on your knees you bend and cower
to bare your soul to be devoured
fire's burning in hell
in hell
i'm the one who leaves shadows in you room at night
i'm the reason you're listening enlightening your eyes
when pan meets apollo down with the sin
they will send tears of angels though kindness won't win
lost northern star
buried in sorrow
i'll guard your mind
let demons howl outside
where the calm fields of snow become one with the sky
"i am there, i am waiting as time passes by"
i set up the weather to suit how you feel
"drop rain down with wishes, build grace out of steel"
lost northern star
buried in sorrow
i'll guard your mind
let demons howl outside
my soul burns
my soul burns
sending dream flakes your way
painting pictures to help you each day
yet you don't know i'm there
lost northern star
buried in sorrow
i'll guard your mind
let demons howl outside
my soul burns
"(lips, reiner, allison, dickson)"
night has fallen
and the darkness hides an evil one
feel his presence
ever lurking in the shadows there
you can't see him but he's near
prowling danger
gazing unseen through his blackened cloak
features masked;he's poised to take your life
cutting deep your flesh; his steely knife
coldly steals your life
the kiss of death
daylight dawning
a fallen victim waiting to be found
badly bleeding
"screaming sirens, people gather round"
it's too late to run in fear
the kiss of death
death is near
the kiss of death
shed a tear

"they say we all are ""things"" from kids beliefs"
and say we're all just fantasy
they burn our woods and kick our little houses
they're wrong!they're wrong!they're wrong!
they're wrong!they wrong!
we don't agree with the shit they do to us!
they say we're not real. they're all wrong!
they shall begin believe we do exist
they will!they will!they will!they will!they will
"we love the trees, we love the rats"
"we kiss the roots, we love the land"
we love the lakes and we roll in the sand
but they can't understand it because
"they only think in themselves, the rest is forgotten"
their things are done and over others build their pride
our lives are bothered
forgetting the ancient ones...
ok my friend we're here to say goodbye
we can't accept this situation anymore
you must look at the beautiful man who lives and
hides inside your head
forget this little man you've been
you must believe us... goodbye
if you don't believe us we'll go away
so you will never see us again we'll go to another land

"don't hang around boy, find yourself a job"
"get it next year, or better, take it today"
don't let the others already come to top
create security for the time you're out of date
before you get old at the underground
soakin' your life away
some pretty nice boys say you must be mad
"you must be jokin', is it funny or sad"
you must be throwing your life away
can't bear existence from powered life all day
you'll miserably die in a dead end street
soakin' your life away

important things in life i'd never sell
got the world and i got you

wrath birth
rise it up
let us oppose
the thought from our land
and cultivate
in a cursed ground
a sorrowful lineage
for so and weigh down
they bottom-hearted careless
who have confidence 'til
that soul bread
for that belief you possess
is nothing else than disgust and pride
and your need after knowledge
is an overflood of scorn and deascration
grief to my heart is not thirst
after heavenly body
not is that failing search after angel might
it is fiery and that burning
it is merely that what you
dishounor for that
take part in the possesing shadow
delight your soul with sinners under
from where are surely you
when lamp put out
but dead appaear not
with our bidding
throughly sound from that splendid inheritance
want it endly ruin
bring doom over others about your own head
there you conceal your shame in praise song
so shall you have tasted fruits
of your own decease
as a flock of hellish origin
and administrator of despicable son
we match your disgusting splendour
with demonstration of our heavy birth
lie your mind in absence of breath
shamefare backwards without might
clench my fist and break my chains
destroy the mirror of tears
i force the night to smash you down
and lose my innocence (i'm)
i can't rewind my life to then
when i was freaming ot warmth
you took away the child i've been
and left me frozen (and)
rewind rewind to then -
i'm an angel
born form the breath of life
an ikarus

"look to the other side, reach the undefined"
curious to what she doesn't know
"step through the empty air, reveal what wasn't there"
a fantasy-her looking glass world
is it as it seems? or just a dream within a dream
"(dream within, dream within a dream)"
"like she's been here before, locked behind the door"
held within the grasp of mystic hands
"everything's so strange, the same but rearranged"
through a bird's eye view-can it all be true?
"the final answer she seeks, with the three to be crowned queen"
essence of rule divides the land-yeah!
"dark shape, above in the sky, captures her prismatic eye"
"again she walks in wonder, with no, with no tearful good-byes"
[part ii:]
alice...alice...run alice...run
"and there she stood, in misery"
searching for the final ring within
"a dream, (dream within a dream)"
dream within a dream
"""i'm not afraid..."""
[part iii:]
scepter in hand-all the numbers so deceiving
the small dreaming child who wears the crown
watches the pieces falling down
like knights in the game-her next move is so unsure
'waken the queen of nevermore
hidden behind the royal doors
"white on her right, red on her left"
"talking in riddles, on ears fallen deaf"
"""stop with all the lies"", all the questions so confusing"
"answer the riddles they deny, losing hope, the child cries"
dream on...
do you believe...all the things that you're seeing are true?
the start's where the end's leading you
do you believe...all's as twisted as one would perceive?
seek the answers...and soon you'll believe
"the royal child, in a rage of desperate fury"
"shattering all that lies before, screaming dolls fall to the floor"
"now remove the masque, that's obscuring this dimension"
"illusions so clear to me now, her invention is unwound"
escape the dream- like an unwritten book
"there at my feet-lies the knight, the queen and the rook"
dream on...
do you believe...all the things that you're seeing are true?
the start's where the end's leading you
do you believe...all's as twisted as one would perceive?
seek the answers...and soon you'll believe
dream on...
do you believe...all the things that you're seeing are true?
the start's where the end's leading you
do you believe...all's as twisted as one would perceive?
seek the answers...and soon you'll believe
you've built your life
above the sin
you hold my hand
before the end comes
forgiving me for what i've done till the end of days
cause i belong to you
cause i am part of you
i am dying in your arms
"it's time to go, i can make it through"
i've come to realise
"tonight my dear, the end of time"
is not so far away
we cannot pray to save our lives
i can feel you and
i think that everything you wanted in me
was the mirror of your dreams
but i coudn't believe what you'd say
as i belong to you
my flesh and blood in you
i am burning in this fire
it's time to go
i can't make it through
i've come to realise
"tonight my dear, the end of time"
is not so far away
we cannot pray to save our lives
i've come to realise
"tonight my friend, the end of time"
is not so far away
we cannot pray to save our lives
i'm coming home again
and now i know where i belong
reeling from my instincts
cause i realise i'm not alone
i've come to realize
"tonight my dear, the end of time"
is not so far away
we cannot pray to save our lives
i've come to realise
"tonight my friend, the end of time"
is not so far away
we cannot pray to save our lives
and i often sigh
i often wonder why
i'm still here and i still cry
and i often cry
i often spill a tear
over those not here
but still they are so near
please ease my burden
and i still remember
a memory and i weep
in my broken sleep
the scars they cut so deep
please erase my burden
please erase my pain
surely without war there would be no loss
"hence no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery"
"no sleepless nights missing the dead ... oh, no more"
no more war
i cannot turn away
from this obscurity
a nameless force
is stealing my face
come and – try to – fight me
you will – never – break me
i know it´s the final breath i´m taking if i let you win
so i cannot be the one forgiving or i´m giving in
now i can see you
you were just hiding
you won´t betray me
cause now i know your name
come and – try to – fight me
you will – never – break me
i know it´s the final breath i´m taking if i let you win
so i cannot be the one forgiving or i´m giving in
"crucifixion, peasants bound to the cross"
"heartless judgement, tyrannical laws"
among the jurists pangs of conscience arise
"conspiracy begins, the crucifier must fall"
assassination was attempted but failed
the conspirators are captured and jailed
enraged by the plot now he vows his revenge
"hunt them down, seek their death, merciless"
collaborators face a summary trial
they are guilty there can be no denial
convicted plotters face the hammer and nail
"the traitors will be punished, the traitors will die"
"their compunction, a sentence of death"
thoughts of mercy are replaced by dread
"punishment for traitors, swift and severe"
"kill them all, they will die, crucify"
"avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill"
"vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails"
"avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill"
"revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell"
"punctured by piercing, the beam dripping blood"
as a deterrent they are left there for months
their agonizing deaths will serve to warn the rest
"betrayers will be hunted, betrayers will die"
"wretched traitors, sun cooking their flesh"
rotting slowly they're begging for death
transfixed by iron only bones will remain
"he will hunt, hell's pursuit, execute"
"avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill"
"vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails"
"avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill"
"revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell"
no remorse for their deaths
no one will be spared from this fate
hammer spikes through their hands
penetrate the soles of their feet
plant the stakes in the ground
raise the crosses of the condemned
proclaim judgement with blood
triumph for the killers of men
solo: barrett
"avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill"
"vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails"
"avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill"
"revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell"
"avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill"
"vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails"
"avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill"
"revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell"
hear me mortals
or i'll condem you to that shit and puke
you were destined to lounge in
you'll work the blood fields
sail the semen seas
feelings of pain and fear
mortal man-animal-prepare to feel hot
see me mortals
in nightmares eat your mind
amongst endless screaming drones
regurgitating bones to plant
and water with your tears
mortal man-animal-prepare to feel hot
fear me mortals
or your mind and guts will explode
in your very own sickly self
you'll haunt the realms of purgatory
dying off pain and fear
mortal man-animal-prepare to feel hot
diving in the lake of thousand faces
every sign seems a delusion and fills me with doubt
"i should’t look for certainty among these disorderly impressions,"
but still i do...
"being estranged, slowly i loose the grip on the reality"
time shall shatter what we have built up
"being estranged, from the reliable"
don’t even recognize the warmth you always fulfilled me with
break through my crystallized sphere and hold me
enter my deepest inner self
imprison the pain
besieging in vain
"it feels like i’m in the middle of a movie, gazing at the script"
it shows me new insights
delighted by the bygone sufferings but already waiting for the next ones
"i bend forward and look between the ripples of the lake, it’s the leading character..."
"break through my crystallized sphere and hold me, wherever you are"
deceitful memories mingled with reality
"i hold myself to the timeless spell, fascinated by never knowing if it really happened"
where the magic stream flows
through the singing woods
blue grass of wisdom grows
around the oaken roots...
where the golden dragons fly
ant the sorcerers gather
four wooden statues stand
and the fog lays thick
dreamthrone of amber
cosmic source of the might
reflection of wisdom
power of the darkside
ceremonial steel drinks blood
painting pearls and gold
mystic flames burn bright
around the oaken lord...
forgotten sorcery storms from the skies
from the golden hall of the ancient ones
forgotten sorcery storms from the skies
from the golden hall of the ancient ones
...the pagans await the equinox
cosmic sorcery- the gift from the skies
magic of nature- stronger than your lies
...stone demigod shines proud...
...the cult of the barbaric seasons...
pagan pride forever
"born to die in honour, not to serve on knees"
"snowcovered, wild vastlands"
my beloved fatherland...
i see the tears of the oaken one
my heart is like a stone
my sword became sharp
crosses to break
bodies to dismember
flowers to burn...
pounding the world like a battering ram
forging the furnace for the final grand slam
chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
hammering anvils straining muscle and might
shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
fast devastating and desolisating the curse
blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
wielding the axe comes the one culmination
that's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
the slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding
that withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills
the bay
pounding the world like a battering ram
forging the furnace for the final grand slam
chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
second to none
lusting for eternal pain
begging to be tortured
"agony brings relief, i am insane"
indulging in self-mutilation
to satisfy my need again
the pain severe from severed veins
curing me of deprivation
pain i crave
euphoric state of butchery
revelling in gore and blood
pain i save
igniting visions of the past
dismembered bodies never found
pain i gave
deranged by my deviance savage goal to maim and kill
"obsessed with my cruelty, vicious ways for me to die"
"sado-masochistic rage, horrific daze, reality"
"pleasure from sadistic intent, driven by my lust for pain"
"punishment my way of life, suffering intensifies"
sacrifice
"wretched abnormality, condoning inhumanity"
suicide
"carnivorous abusiveness, boiling sawn-off testicles"
afflicted fate stricken to malignancy
lechery dominates my misery
"tortured eternally, torment inside of me"
"disturbing impulses, living in agony"
rancid degenerate craving impalement
"demented destiny, not fearing agony"
excruciating hunger that i need to feed
"soon to be slaughtered, dead, maliciously"
"tortured eternally, torment inside of me"
"disturbing impulses, living in agony"
rancid degenerate craving impalement
"demented destiny, not fearing agony"
"deranged by my deviance, savage goal to maim and kill"
"obsessed with my cruelty, vicious ways for me to die"
"sado-masochistic rage, horrific daze, reality"
"pleasure from sadistic intent, driven by my lust for pain"
the morals of life and the perils of death
take the wrong way out running out of breath
meet my match in the afterlife
suppress the demons that plague the night
a tortured mind is a safe place to go
but the truth lurks down in the dark below
step inside my inquisitive mind
are you scared at what you just might find
see myself in the hall of mirrors
a different shape every step i take
a different mind every step of the line
but in the end they are all mine
laughing sorrow inside your head
can't get out just a feeling of dread
i know this burden is a heavy load
a dark mist ake never ending road
the black jack king and the red queen clash
the artful dodger he counts his stash
the joker's wild like an impish child
while madame fortune she waits inside
the good luck charm is overkill
the tired old soldier says fire at will
planes overhead go search destroy
the ones below human decoy
i need somebody to save me
meanwhile we play the waiting game
the clock is struck the horse is lame
and when we think tha t this is done
chance your luck a four leafed one
you hedge your bets the battle lost
to wait in vain and count the cost
the thin edged line
between good and bad
and cast the luck be happy sad
i need somebody to save me
the red and the black
people don't want the truth
look in their eyes and you send them away
the red and the black
fate and hypocrisy
burden's a heavy load there is no doubt
the red and the black
all out of luck again
how many chances can anyone have
the red and the black
treachery out to win
there in the wrong place and at the wrong time
i need somebody to save me
"it's killing you, you're killing me,"
"i'm clinging on to my sanity,"
all i need is a short term remedy
come and hide me from this terrible reality...
dreaded memories flood back to me
"but there's still a wilful mind behind these cold,"
"psychotic eyes,"
"now i tread this path so differently,"
i've opened my mind and darkened my entire life.
"i'll dance wit the angels to celebrate the holocaust,"
"and far beyond my far gone pride,"
"is knowing that we'll soon be gone,"
knowing that i'll soon be gone...
timeless we are
children running
through
i lost myself in you
found myself in truth
lose ourselves along the way
sky is changing
distant lightning
far the falling rain
i lost myself in you
found myself in truth
lose ourselves along the way
find ourselves in time again
lost myself in you
found myself in truth
golden summer skies
"shadows form, dance, and die"
lost myself in you
found myself in truth
brooding clouds not far away
dark the storm that's coming
"""get away from me!"
take heed to thyself and see my face no more!
for in the day thou see my face
"thou shalt die!"""
- exodus 10:28
a constellation of divine architecture built on earth
a holy harbour - orion
nautical ascension to the firmament
ship-shaped barrows open my heart to the wisdom of this land
sailing with the serpent chimera of a fiendish sandman
the unicorn arrives with the westwind to dream my
funeral
"""thou art born for horus, for horus dwells in thee"""
slumbering with the ebb and the flow of this foaming tomb
"""thou art born for seteh, for seteh dwells in thee"""
reveal your face to me and guide me through the stygian fields
enthral my soul to sepedet's beams to serve your will
sailing on the distant seas from darkness to deliverance
tales like the ocean written to the draco's glance
ruling with the scythe of death you tear our philosophies
apart
an ancient starwalk to merge into the stars
"""open thy veins for my venom"
kiss the cobras with thy twisted tongue
so shalt thou join the empyrean circus
where beggars mourn and seraphs dance
in this twilight cathedral
"shall i wed thee,"
"o bride of the netherworld"""
sailing on the distant seas from darkness to deliverance
tales like the ocean written to the draco's glance
ruling with the scythe of death you tear our philosophies
apart...
join my soul the hunter in the sky
never knew how much i love you
never knew how much i cared
when you put your arms around me
i get a fever that's so hard to bear
you give me fever
when you kiss me
fever when you hold me tight
fever
in the morning
fever all through the night
sun lights up the daytime
moon lights up the night
i light up when you call my name
'cause you know i'm gonna treat you right
you give me fever
when you kiss me
fever when you hold me tight
fever
in the morning
fever all through the night
everybody's got the fever
that is something you all know
fever isn't such a new thing
fever started long ago
romeo loved juliet
"juliet, she felt the same"
when he put his arms around her
"he said, ""julie, baby, you're my flame"""
thou givest fever
when we kisseth
fever with thy flaming youth
fever
i'm on fire
"fever, yeah, i burn forsooth"
way back in the garden of eden
adam and eve were in a fright
"adam said, ""hey eve, whatcha got there? """
"she said, ""daddy, just take a bite"""
you give me fever
when you kiss me
fever when you hold me tight
fever
i'm on fire
fever all through the night
now you've listened to my story
here's the point that i have made
cats were born to give chicks fever
be it fahrenheit or centigrade
they give you fever
when we kiss you
fever if you live and learn
fever
'til you sizzle
what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn
crawl through the things that eat your flesh
drown in my waters that know you best
step inside i've been waiting here for you
underneath where you shall crawl
fly so high you'll never fall
step inside we've been waiting here for you
bow down you chose your maker
he never gives he's always the taker
the electric burns that fuel the fire
it's just your suicide messiah
oh yeah
oh yeah
walk through the streets that know your name
all that's pure is now insane
step inside i've been waiting here for you
another trip another lie
lifes hand of doom you're feeling fine
step inside we've been waiting here for you
bow down you chose your maker
he never gives he's always the taker
the electric burns that fuel the fire
it's just your suicide messiah
"music: lynch, pilson"
"lyrics: brown, lynch, pilson"
i'm like a wildcat at midnight
i'm like a stick of dynamite
evil senses taking over me
gonna let the action steal the night
turn up the heat
"turn down the lights (action, action)"
turn up the heat
baby go all night
turn on the action
turn on the night
turn on the action
turn on the night
i'm looking over my shoulder
i'm running reckless thru the night
forever young not getting older
satisfaction guaranteed tonight
turn up the heat
"turn down the lights (action, action)"
turn up the heat
baby go all night
turn on the action
turn on the night
turn on the action
turn on the night
your eyes are open but do you really see
unhearing ears that won't listen to thee
"you speak in riddles, it's a twisted truth"
it makes me wonder who's corrupting the youth?
you read the scriptures but did you understand
you cast the first stone from your almighty hand
you say that all is black when there is white
"no need to show me, show me the light"
corporate preacher
disgracing the cross
corporate preacher
"tv church, it's big business time"
please won't you tell me what's your new prophet's line?
cursed from above
an ernest smile as you swaggart on stage
a bakker's dozen turn the page
words of truth spoken in lies
you milk the faithful with your cryin eyes
don't try to tell me how to run my life
when you can't be faithful even to your wife
i don't need anybody but me
i don't want anybody but you
all this faith and still i don't believe
i don't need anybody but me
come onget up get off your knees
we'll bring down the machine
"all my sisters, all my brothers"
burning in the sun
when we fight we die together
we are the children of the gun
i can't see anyone before me
you can't see anyone before you
all this faith and still i don't believe
i can't see anyone before me
"don't shoot me, i'm just the messenger"
don't shoot me...

travel the ways singing the unknown
"come with me, the truth it shall be shown"
forget all you know and all that you've learned
"who you are, it shall be found"
through the darkest light beyond the down
"temple of light, you shall not be mourned"
trampled beneath the shaking light that has been sworn
forget all you know and all that you've learned
"who you are, it shall be found"
through the darkest light beyond the down
empty and sweating
head lying in your hands
shaking in the corner
done too much alcohol
gotta get away from it all
'cause it feels my blood is freezing
my self insanity has taken its toll
frustration has taken its control
now i'm far from home
spending time alone
it's time to set my demons free
been put to the test
my mind laid to rest
i'm on a psycho holiday
shot down on sight
you are the target of attention
one woman here another there
you can't please all the people all the time
can't tell the strangers
from the friends you know
frustration has taken it's control
now you're far from home
spending time alone
it's time to set your demons free
been put through the test
your mind laid to rest
you're on a psycho holiday
i'm strapped in for life
is this where i lived
or where i died
you want my money
you take my space
my mind is telling me
to leave this place
my self insanity has taken its toll
frustration has taken its control
now i'm far from home
spending time alone
it's time to set my demons free
been put to the test
my mind laid to rest
i'm on a psycho holiday

in my blood you reached this far
in my soul you found this much
the circles of hell on earth
travelled together times upon times
when you have lived this cruel
and emptied the veins once full
bloodlines of life going back in your hands
bloodlines of life in return to the past
"blood tells, memorial"
"blood tells, memorial"
now you have gone too far
now you have found too much
the circles of blood completed
as it was once for the last
now we have lived this full
still we have nothing at all
from the line of the life we fall
in the shifting sands of the heart
"blood tells, memorial"
to put together the words
to bring together our worlds
to be together the curse
to live together our horrors
now we have lived this full
always we had nothing to prove!
"what the soul hides, blood tells!"
now we have lived this full
to you we have nothing to prove!
"what the soul hides, blood tells!"

"something wrong, something right, something missing"

don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
"something black, something light, something different"
"something wrong, something right, something missing"
don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
all this noise in my head
ringing through and echoing
"simple things just take too long, long, long"
it's not like i'm not listening
but you just keep on flipping it
"and maybe one day i'll be gone, gone, gone"
"something wrong, something right, something missing"
"something black, something light, something different"
don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
"something black, something light, something different"
"something wrong, something right, something missing"
don't you ever feel you need to speak to me that way?
to me that way
try to leave the past behind me
but you just keep reminding me
"and threw it in my face so wrong, wrong, wrong"
i try to see things your way
but something changes every day
"and every question way too long, long, long"
"something wrong, something right, something missing"

a frail form surrounds
"infection, sorrow, screams aloud"
trade your soul connect to fear
"feeding death, tormented downed"
"forget the past, are you still believing tonight's denial dominates the dreaming"
a veiled mourner's frown
tomorrows dreams confound
trade the souls you hold most dear
into darkness you're the last
"forget the past, are you still believing"
tonight's denial dominates the dreaming
i can hope as silence and torture grows
the violence we now condemn infests our inner souls
"regret the past, are you still believing, tonight's denial dominates the dreaming"
i can hope as silence and torture grows
a frail form surrounds
"infection, sorrow, screams aloud"
trade your soul connect to fear
"feeding death, tormented downed"
i know you can feel it
(let it in)
people will still hate you in the end
"so hate back, plan the attack"
then they'll realize they can't crack
the mind of a fucking maniac
the voice inside you always wins
your graves been dug so lie in it
and commit until the end for your dead old friend
and i promisse that amends will meet at the end
why can i be anything without you
because the scars will fade
and you'll never age when
you give your life to the mark of the blade
the cold grasp of the past still haunts me
i will erase everything if you give your life
to the mark of the blade
you can come with me or you can stay and grow old
turn a blind eye to everything
or take a chance to be blind to model ignorance
the voice inside you never quits
it'll haunt you until your dying breath
"so breathe in and breathe out, reach deep within"
and i promisse that amends will meet at the end
why can i be anything without you
because the scars will fade
and you'll never age
when you give your life to the mark of the blade
the cold grasp of the past still haunts me
i will erase everything
if you give your life to the mark of the blade
give your life to the mark of the blade
(give your life)
i'll take your name beyond the grave
give your life to the mark of the blade
(give your life)
give your life to the mark of the blade
i bleed the blood that is cut from the blade
i bear the mark and i won't be a slave
come with me and be saved
why can i be anything without you
because the scars will fade
and you'll never age
when you give your life to the mark of the blade
the cold grasp of the past still haunts me
i will erase everything
if you give your life to the mark of the blade

out of the darkness the voices are calling
riding the wings of a song
the fury is screaming and heaven is falling
i feel it coming on strong
the lightning strikes cracking the night
it feels like never before
thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
i hear a rising force
searching my soul i find something else
i take my life in my hands
from the gates of heaven to the altars of hell
the power is at my command
the lightning strikes cracking the night
it feels like never before
thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
i feel a rising force
burned by the glory of a sacred fire
the rising force starts to shine
a burning inferno it soars ever higher
heaving the demons behind
the lightning strikes cracking the night
it feels like never before
thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
i feel a rising force
the lightning strikes cracking the night
i'm not the same anymore
thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
i feel a rising force
"danger, danger, there's something in the air"
"faster, faster, be careful, you better beware"
"i had a dream last night, i saw you burn"
"someone screaming out, screaming out the words"
"run for your lives, they set the place on fire (*)"
"run for your lives, the flames are getting higher"
"burning, burning, fire in the night"
"higher, higher, the flames are shining bright"
"i've got nowhere to run, i was blinded by the light"
"there's someone screaming out, sreaming in the night"
put all your angels on the edge
"keep all the roses, i'm not dead"
i left a thorn under your bed
i'm never gone
go tell the world i'm still around
"i didn't fly, i'm coming down"
"you are the wind, the only sound"
whisper to my heart
when hope is torn apart
and no one can save you
i walk alone
every step i take
i walk alone
my winter storm
holding me awake
it's never gone
when i walk alone
go back to sleep forever more
far from your fools and lock the door
they're all around and they'll make sure
you don't have to see
what i turned out to be
no one can help you
i walk alone
every step i take
i walk alone
my winter storm
holding me awake
it's never gone
when i walk alone
waiting up in heaven
i was never far from you
spinning down i felt your every move
i walk alone
i walk alone
every step i take
i walk alone
my winter storm
holding me awake
it's never gone
when i walk alone
think tank trials
thought it out
think tank trials
thought it out and drew just blanks
when the simple terms elude me
think tank trials
short wavelengths
static spins my head
when the simple terms elude me
inquisition has a basic function
i've exhausted
inquisition
i've overthought
searcher overwrought in dour
aimless walls
dead set against indecision
"sweat the details, still fail"
indecision
i'll contemplate while logic vacates
"the dour, aimless walls"
the heaped-up agitation
of the narcissistic - brood
yet i won't entertain the simplistic
viewpoints flood into every frame
- brood
removed over time from seeing
anything straight
"scrutinize, obsess"
think tank trials
scrutinized
think tank trials
and drew just blanks
i am the flood
who drags the dirt
and lives on it
she is the soil
with whom i flirt
and rots with it
i am the flood
who purifies
i guess she calls me
the lord of lies
when i'm inside her
feels like she is
made of storm
i am the flood
who likes the dirt
and sleeps with it
she is the soil
with whom i flirt
she rots within
i am the flood
who purifies
she does not know
she's fucking with
the lord of lies
when i'm inside her
feels like she is
made of storm
"time has come, we'll never rest"
at the end of the battle we fight
"no more tears, no more pain"
glory for us all
"see the burning horizon, flames in the night"
"oh, they rise up high"
we're crossing the landscape on our way to the light
"oh, for the battle we fight"
now it's time to release our souls from all disease
"a kingdom will come, a keeper of the crown"
"a call for rebellion, scream for revenge"
"oh, for freedom we stand"
"hymns of redemption, we're singing along"
a hail to the band of the strong
now it's time to release our souls from all disease
"see the sign we believe, carry on, carry on eternally"
"a kingdom will come, far beyond,"
we are guardians of the crown
"we are the ones, we are the ones"
we are wanderers on the run
"we carry on, we marching on"
to the calley of the crimson dawn
so glorious we're standing strong
together we keep up the sign
"we are the ones, we are the ones"
"we are wanderers, wanderers on the run"
"we are an army of brave ones, with steel in our hand"
"oh, for freedom we stand"
"by fire and sword, through the heat of the night"
"oh, for the battle we fight"
"we are the ones, we are the ones"
we are wanderers on the run
"we carry on, we marching on"
to the calley of the crimson dawn
so glorious we're standing strong
together we keep up the sign
"we are the ones, we are the ones"
"we are wanderers, wanderers on the run"
we are the lost ones in the emptiness of life
"no fear in darkness, not scared of loneliness"
"high up the mountaints, across the barren fields"
we're on our way to the promised land
"i am the keeper of the dawn, i'm deadlocked insane"
"the evil, the black, a monster inside, a factory of pain"
"get away, get away let out my soul"
"keep away, keep away, tear down the wall"
"deliverance of evil, a dark adaption to a factory of pain"
while the shades of the crimson dawn
still hide the power of light
breaks the sign of our victory
the seals to paradise
"we are the ones, we are the ones"
we are wanderers on the run
"we carry on, we marching on"
to the calley of the crimson dawn
so glorious we're standing strong
together we keep up the sign
"we are the ones, we are the ones"
"we are wanderers, wanderers on the run"
destined!
this is - predetermined
"if you follow, through!"
follow through every byway
follow fate on your journey
"river deep, mountain high"
through daylight and darkest nights
though my tale starts cold and lonely
the promise that i heard coloured my world
to the - outline of a greater spectrum
where chances are revealed fate will be sealed
"walk the path, ford the stream 'till i reach my dream"
"this is the moment, my redemption"
this is the day that all the stars align
i gain my momentum
"every endeavour, every measure"
led the way to overcome and say
"i've answered to thee, call of destiny"
not a course for the faint-hearted
this journey that i'm on demands my all
i will - overthrow my tribulations
"and value what they're worth, let it be heard"
gain control self-esteem 'till i reach my dream
"this is the moment, my redemption"
this is the day that all the stars align
i gain my momentum
"every endeavour, every measure"
led the way to overcome and say
i've answered to thee call of destiny
follow through every byway
follow fate on your journey
"river deep, mountain high"
through daylight and darkest nights
"i'll walk the path, every stepping stone! oh!"
i'll ford the stream! time to live my dream!
"this is the moment, my redemption"
this is the day that all the stars align
i gain my momentum
every endeavour every measure
led the way to overcome and say
i am here today!
"this is the moment, my redemption"
this is the day that all the stars align
i gain my momentum
"every endeavour, every measure"
led the way to overcome and say
i am here today!
the moment's now here and mine!
my fate fulfilled and defined!
"oh, call of destiny"
call of destiny
corrigida por- thiago portilho.
buried alive
suffering day by day
the black forces
in your own hell's throat
death's shout
paralyses your sense
pleasure in suffering
cries out for blood
fear
from side to side
pain
crossing in pur minds
evil
was born in the human brain
a dream?
no way
red lights
like hearts in pain
black sun
burning in your eyes
maniac life
can't see the great problems
horror and terror
determining the world
fear
from side to side
pain
crossing in pur minds
evil
was born in the human brain
a dream?
no way
straw men
straw minds
crossed way
tied up with no way out
no expression
no liberty
blocked feelings in the death industry
fear
from side to side
pain
crossing in pur minds
evil
was born in the human brain
a dream?
no way
ego selfish prima donna
dancing in your poisoned cage
thinking that your conscience's clearer
if you drink your dreams away
feed your anger to the devil
in your selfbuilt wishing well
take a swim in muddy waters
all the dirt will leave a trail
had enough symphonies of sorrow
the best of prey a breath away
masterpiece of treachery
built a wall and make me crumble
just because i am in love
don't you cry now look at all the
dolls and toys that you have got
smash the mirror of perversion
with the dagger that you made
"mirror, mirror is there someone"
who can make your day today?
had enough symphonies of sorrow
the best of prey a breath away
had enough symphonies of sorrow
the best of prey a breath away
masterpiece of treachery
kept my thoughts buried in a box
with each shot i still kept it locked
you drew a play written with my blood
went ahead just to feed the lot
had enough symphonies of sorrow
the best of prey a breath away
had enough symphonies of agony
the best of prey a breath away
masterpiece of treachery
it's been a year
my hands are gone
oh its a shame
theres no one here
cause i'm alone
oh i'm in pain
the pains we kill
whats done
oh the pain
i… i… i… i… i…
i need blood
i need blood........
i'm buried
in dust
oh i'm dying
i couldn't carry
my legs are bum
oh cant climb
the angel said
cause i am man
oh there's a time
i… i… i… i… i…
i need blood
i need blood........
in the ocean of dreams
things are changing but staying the same
nothing is like it seems
so unreal that it drives me insane in the heat of seven
suns surrender to the
power of time. end of the line - ready or not but you'll
always remember
everyday in your life you've lonely
every tear in your eye is only
little step on the way to face your fear - i'm thinking
about you
every page that you'll turn'll remind you what
everyday is another lonely tear falling in the sea of time
gentle voice from above
makes you carry your cross through the day
speaking wisdom and love
to confuse you - then fading away
into the light of 7th sun he'll run
"don't be afraid, never surrender"
ages will pass but we'll always remember

in the realm of the black magic man
soul's flight into the cold blight
of the destroyer's magic land
"poor man, whose spirits are stronger"
they're the ones who will reign
you're struggles are in vain
"blind man, you're suckin' your own blood"

a savage dragon in the dark cavern mouth
a rancid below pours from it
if you are spatterd with his venomous poison
beware and protect from his swishing tail
kill kill the dragon
kill kill - the beast inside
kill kill the dragon
victory is by my side
he thrust the sword into the dragon's guts
pierced his heart and shut his mouth
he tasted the blood and listened to the birds
who told him about the liars words
kill kill the dragon
kill kill - the beast inside
kill kill the dragon
victory is by my side
"your body looks perfect, your face like a rat"

helldriver come to me
"stay with me, drive on with me"
helldriver come to me
"stay with me, (then some)"
driving the speedway like a superstar
the wheels are turning all this crap in your car

you know you winner - with ten in a row
helldriver come to me
"stay with me, drive on with me"
helldriver come to me
"stay with me, (then some)"

"i, i woke up"
the god of fire woke me up
at the edge of burning ground
"i'm, i'm damned"
to put out the fire
my hand is a trap for that fire
it won't surprise me in my dream
"my dream wakes me up, instantly"
without a word my hand is a trap
trap for that fire
"i, i drown it with water"
i kill it on the spot
it won't have time to run far
it won't get away from me
can't get rid of this taste of blood
can't erase the face that hunts me
a call from the shadows below
a serenade of haunting voices
someone is digging my grave
waiting for my body to arrive
my soul will burn alive
my blood is cold as ice
night after night
i hear them calling from the dark without light
fight after fight
"i keep on falling, deeper and deeper below"
to the world that i don't wanna know
life after life
the darkness will fall again
chased by the dead and the lonely
i know that's my own devour
the evil inside growing stronger
someone is digging my grave
waiting for my body to arrive
but my soul will burn alive
my blood is cold as ice
night after night
i hear them calling from the dark without light
fight after fight
"i keep on falling, deeper and deeper below"
to the world that i don't wanna know
life after life
"won't fall asleep, i will stay you light"
it's not the right time - for your devastation
your evil mind defying the curse
won't let go
night after night
i hear them calling from the dark without light
fight after fight
"i keep on falling, deeper and deeper below"
to the world that i don't wanna know
life after life

we swear it on the bible
if wanted on the koran
it's always good for trouble
to have a holy ghost
we have made a decision
there is forgiveness if you need
but this is not in this world
you have to wait and wait
there is no - no other way
you can't just believe what you want
no other way - no no
"you can read it in the book, what's good or bad"
heaven is there where hell is
"and hell is down on earth, oh yeah"
you shouldn't kill your brother
except if he doesn't know what's right
if he can't love your heaven
"ah, it's mercy for him to die"
and then it's so much better
than to live without redemption
this is easy to do so
"and you can read how it works, ha ha"
all you need is a holy ghost
"oh, he will comfort you"
no other way - no no
that's how they're cheating you
and make believe what's good or bad
heaven is there where hell is
"and hell is down on earth, is it heaven or hell"
heaven is there where hell is
and hell is down on earth
"down on earth, oh yes it is"
is it heaven or hell
i'm sure we all know them
those perverts they're everywhere
"mmh, we're talking straight about facts"
you know deep inside what's right or wrong
"and the world stinks, and the paradise is now sewer"
and they sell shit for gold
and you have to take what you've got
heaven is never in heaven
and hell is down on earth
heaven is there where hell is
and hell is down on earth
heaven is never in heaven
and hell is down on earth
heaven is there where hell is
and hell is down on earth
heaven is never in heaven
and hell is down on earth
heaven is there where hell is
and hell is down on earth
heaven is never in heaven
and hell is down on earth
heaven is there where hell is
and hell is down on earth
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
heaven is there where hell is
"and hell is down on earth, oh yes it is"
heaven is there where hell is
"and hell is down on earth, down on earth"
heaven is there where hell is
and hell is down on earth
heaven is there where hell is
"and hell is down on earth, yes it is"
"oh, don't you think that heaven is there where hell is"
tell me is it heaven or hell
we send satellites to space
and we own the biggest missiles
we give millions of support for technology
but still we can't even live in peace with our neighbour
most of us are insane of neuroses
enough is enough - you can control
enough is enough - those who don't know
faster - this world is heading straight into a big disaster
"tell me, when will it reach its end?"
bigger - when moneymakers stamp our souls with technology
"believe me, this got to reach an end"
"all this misery in our minds will break free, you will see..."
social psychology - seek the key for our salvation
"this science needs more support, it could help that"
"the understanding of the single person can grow,"
but who pays
'cause if we stay weak we are much better to use
enough is enough - head over heart
enough is enough - right from the start
faster - this world is heading straight into a big disaster
"tell me, when will it reach its end?"
bigger - when moneymakers stamp our souls with technology
"believe me, this got to reach an end"
"all this misery in our minds will break free, you will see..."
science is only as good or as bad
as the people who use it
and if we want to have a tomorrow
we should take ten percent of the money from our armies
and develop the minds of our nations
enough is enough - you can control
enough is enough - those who don't know
faster - this world is heading straight into a big disaster
"tell me, when will it reach its end?"
bigger - when moneymakers stamp our souls with technology
"believe me, this got to reach an end"
"faster - a victory 'bout fear, this is the greatest glory"
"believe me, the first step has been made"
bigger - the real progress - another quality in our way of life
from quantity to quality
you don't want me anymore
so i'll just walk right out the door
played a game right from the start
"i trust you, you used me"
and now my hearts all torn apart
"so i'm sailin', well i'm sailin' on"
"well i'm movin', hey i'm movin' on"
sail on (4x)
try to see if i'll give up
but there wasn't any luck
"it's a fact, fact of life"
"that's the games, games of strife"
everything is all stride
"so i'm sailin', well i'm sailin' on"
"well i'm movin', hey i'm movin' on"
sail on (4x)
"so i'm sailin', well i'm sailin' on"
"well i'm movin', hey i'm movin' on"
sail on (4x)
"there's too many years,"
whit too many tears
"and too many days,"
whith nothing to say
"and how will we know,"
when there's now here to grow
and what's the facts
for life to show
blindness feeds the world to madness
"faith's crumbling, there's no doubt about it"
religion and science fighting a new kind of war
helpless - wander the streets in desperation
fearless - to the path they tread
shameless - the powers that butcher
ignorant to the deeds that they commit
when all is said and done
heaven lies in my heart
no slave to beliefs that propagate pain
when all is said and done
heaven lies in our hearts
this life is a gift to be lived and loved
fracturing the structure of nature
iconic catalysts to slaughter
a stalemate bursting bound by contradictions
heartless - divine blueprints of hatred
selfless - diseased masterplans
shameless - the powers that butcher
ignorant to the deeds that they commit
decoded treachery shielding the tyranny
black bible tyrants behind masks of righteousness
relentless - the onslaught of misunderstanding
descending into a unified chaos
one more chance for a shot at redemption
"lost within, can we summon the might?"
lost in my own dream
i'm standing at the wall
dark clouds are passing by
and the evil takes control
emptyness is calling
i light a candle now
so many times i've talked to the dead
the reason to go down
in memory of you
wait till the morning dew
"it hurts my soul, it kills my mind"
in memory of you
it feels so dark inside
waiting till the morning light
walking all alone
"a red sky, the morning comes"
i take you with me
down to the crematorium
once there was a secret
and nobody will find out
so many times i've talked to the dead
the reason to go down
in memory of you
wait till the morning dew
"it hurts my soul, it kills my mind"
in memory of you
it feels so dark inside
waiting till the morning light
no more doors
no more locks
no more windows
no more box
no more
no less
no more six foot digs
no more hypocrites
no more emptiness
no more consequence
no more puppet strings
no more disease
no more growing up
no more hapiness
no more lying down
no more complecence
i have...i hold the key...to nothing...it's a small
killing
murder... murders in the hands...of
motion...as it seems to be
no more nothing
no more anything
no more you
no more me
no more posturing victories
no more nations to defeat
no more speaking truth
no more deceit
no more holding down
no more pushing me
no more new world order
no more anarchy
i have...i hold the key...to nothing...it's a
small killing
murder... murders in the hands...of motion...as
it seems to be
i'm washing my hands...of the whole thing
i want no more nothing
i have...i hold the key...to nothing...it's a
small killing
murder... murders in the hands...of motion...as
it seems to be
"i'm washing my hands, of everything...."
of everything we are....
catch me if you can and tame the beast
should i leave you burning in the heat
"kick the throttle down, i'm on fire"
it turns me on to feel the engine's beat
take it to the highway (*)
on the open road
i want to feel your power
screaming into overload
"she's running hot, she's hot"
"coming out of nowhere, moving fast"
i gotta keep the feeling
make it last
let me feel your body
i'll explode
together we will run to overload
d. dokken/k. keeling
it was late like the storm
finding it hard tried to carry on
without fear or the shame
we could walk in park without being afraid
was a time i believed
as the story unfolded so free
now the passion is gone
all wrong
down to the lake moonlit dawn
there was a time i believed
time would heal everything
was a time i believed
you were everything i need
they say that it's starting to show
should have seen it long ago
there was a time i believed
you were everything i need
as a child
we believed
we could wake from the night and the dawn it seemed
was so warm
so warm
into his arms like a child i was born
was a time i believed
time would heal everything
was a time i believed
you were everything i need
interlude
you took me like the sage
searching for some absolution
hard to know the reason nobody cared
once upon a time
take me right away
let me know there's still a season
let me know there's still a reason to live
i'm running out of time
there was a time i believed
time would heal everything
was a time i believed
you were everything i need
they say that it's starting to show
should have seen it long ago
there was a time i believed
you were everything i need
so now iâ€™m taking a chase of cavasier
with all of those words that we shouldn't have said
walking the beach for the last time again
missing you more than i should
these empty days are filling me with pain
after i left it seems my life is only rain
my heart is longing to the better times
when everything was still so fine
i wonder why it happens so fast
you give your heart away knowing it might not last
i'm still here waiting for the rain to fall
and to see you once again
4000 rainy nights
4000 nights i'd be with you
4000 rainy nights with you
i keep your memory in my heart
you give me hope when everything is so dark
that thing nobody can take away
forever in me
4000 rainy...
can you tell me
is there any other way?
i cannot hide it
i have doubts
i'm not afraid to stay
i'm here
when the curtain falls
once i've touched the rainbow
the man on the moon will appear
i won't show fear
"i turn to you, father death"
i am begging you
please
consider
you may have been wrong
just close your eyes now
just close your eyes now
the end's a miracle
dream on if you dare
straight through the mirror
we'll sail on through the air
there's magic everywhere
just be aware
wake up when the crow will call
there is no truth
"there are no rules,"
there's no plote here
it's twisted
we're still on course
my friend
down to the abyss - orcus lane
shelter of your memories
shelter of your pain
the mirror shows truth
reveals what you are
a phoenix in flames
arise from the ashes again
we're on the way now
we're on the way now
we sail through miracles
dream on if you dare
straight throught the mirror
we'll sail on throught the air
i feel
there is something wrong
it's twisted and turning
when everything's burning
awake
it's not safe
i'm coming down to you again
we'll sail on miracles and then
if you don't mind
i'll sing a song
a sort of lullaby this time
when you're asleep
i'm back again
a world of miracles in hand
if you don't mind
i'll sing a song
a sort of lullaby this time
"we're on our way, now"
"we're on our way, now"
the end's a miracle
dream on if you dare
straight through the mirror
we'll sail on through the air
there's magic everywhere
just be aware
wake up when the crow will call
wake up when the crow will call
"heard that i found jesus, when i do he's dead"
"endless speculation, why would i repent?"
if i find salvation and the book of hymns
their annihilation will not get me in
expose god religion to my dying death
cannot be forgiven by your holiness
"will i learn my lesson, bare their sympathy?"
answer to your question - that ain't happening
bow before no god that cannot be seen
and wants to show mercy on people like me
facing their judgment to settle the score
"refusal of penance, i laugh at your lord"
"grace of god refusal, evil to the end"
"instrument of satan, i have always been"
challenge my conviction to the baphomet
smash his crucifixion right against your head
"contents under pressure explode, kill your ass"
total devastation in the aftermath
"i behold no penance, only dignity"
in hell with lord satan for eternity
bow before no god that cannot be seen
and wants to show mercy on people like me
facing their judgment to settle the score
"refusal of penance, i laugh at your lord"

change has begun
after the shape
freakish events
led to this change
convert the man
from the norm
alteration
surreal figure
misshapen thoughts
sickening metamorphosis
twisting flesh
ghastly face
pain distress
mind displace
twisted flesh transforming appearnce of the
ghastly face of the one that it chose
pain distress of contortions and straining
mind displaced as the spirit arose
hideous one
adapting fast
new skin grows out
old skin peels off
extra limbs sprout
mutilation
alteration
surreal figure
misshapen thoughts
sickening metamorphosis
shifting bones
gnarled limbs
gruesome change
features grim
shifting bonestrans forming the framework and the
gnarled limbs are beginning to grow
gruesome change to repellent appearance
features grim in compelete overthrow
tentacles extending from the face
eyes are growing on his hands and back
spikes and fangs cover his body
"skeleton re-shapes, bons pop and crack"
[solo - o'brien]
a monstrous thing he has become
murderous compulsions flood his mind
reconstruction reaches completion
he's no longer part of mankind
altration

misshapen thoughts
sickening metamorphosis
twisting flesh

twisted flesh transforming appearance of the
ghastly face of the one that it chose
pain distress of contortions and straining
mind displaced as the spirit arose
wake to see your true emancipation is a fantasy
policies have risen up and overcome the brave
"greatness dies, unsung and lost, invisible to history"
embedded spies brainwashing our children to be mean
you don't have long
i am on to you. the time
it has come to destroy
your supremacy!
ahh!
ooh oh
ooh oh
you don't have long
i am on to you. the time

yeah ooh yeah oh
"she spoke to me, approaching me"
on a road so dark and dreary
her black halo walked by me
disappearing so far behind
she travelled not alone
an old wife followed on her side
and snakes crawled behind her steps
and crows circled overhead
time and again they come to me
in the darkness of the night
and the raven-haired girl
whispers her listless words
do not look at me
i am the daughter of hate
you must not see me
never touch my heart
never!
the words of raven-haired girl
do not look at me
'cause i'm the daughter of hate
"each morn i swear, each day i pledge"
should we yet meet
on the road of dream
that we would look each other in the eye
time and again they come to me
in the darkness of the night
and the raven-haired girl
whispers her listless words
do not look at me
i am the daughter of hate
you must not see me
never touch my heart
never!
the words of raven-haired girl
do not look at me
'cause i'm the daughter of hate
"first come the ravens, swirling overhead"
"your words, the hiss of snake"
the old wife is ever silent
"your words, the hiss of snake"
kun taivas taas on pimeä
ja tuuli tuo askelten äänet
odotan kuun alla
vaanin varjojen välissä
ensin tulivat korpit
kieppuivat kulkueen yllä
vanha vaimo on sanaton
sinun sanasi käärmeen kuiskaus on
do not look at me
i am the daughter of hate
you must not see me
never touch my heart
never!
"your words, the hiss of snake"
the words of raven-haired girl
whispered in my ear
the sigh of the raven-haired girl
never!
do not look at me
'cause i'm the daughter of hate
"recruiting the ill-fated for ""the war"""
"a legion of uneducated ,bankrupt souls"
"with a lust for revenge,answering the call"
from new yorqatar to califarabia
desperation provides fettile ground for religious extremism
this glorious brainwashing where prejudice lies
like a crouching tiger
tormenting peasants till they erect an army
under everyone's nose
"in the end propaganda destroys their dna,god help them"
solo-drover
solo-mustaine
all that they envisioned of what things would come to be
turned into a pink mist when they blew to smithereens
we are just a war away from amerikhastan
when god versus god;the undoing of man
"promising a vapor,in the end they become one"
solo-drover
"no rules of engagement,this enemy hides"
amongst women and children
"and to beat violence,you must ignore the focus groups"
"you must send in the mossad, turn of the bbc,cnn"

"rest assured there'll be no more middle eastern crisis,hell!"
there'll be no more middle east!
these are your people lady liberty
pull up your dress today

but a roaring lion is about to be unleashed on earth
"hey,jihad joe?guess what?we're coming to get you!"

all that you envisioned of what things will come to be
turns into a death knell when you look behind the scenes
we are just a war away from amerikhastan

a silhouette casts black shadows
along the desert floor
above the trees and mountains
the raven wing soars
a totem of creation
a sign of life and death
messenger of spirirt realms
its magic never rests
"no, no, no"
"no, no, no, no"
it never rests
when in your darkest moments
and you're trapped in deep despair
you'll never see me coming
but i am always there
i am the wise shape-shifter
and i am always there
if you're choked with inhibition
and you've sown the seeds of doubts
it is my full intention
i will seek you out
i am fates magician
i'll strip you of your doubt
with blackened wings i fly

you wanna know where the legends live?
"at the rainbow's end i'll be there,"
there's a place in innerspace.....
that's where i'll get to you
i'm not the shy retiring kind
i'm like a supernova for the blind
i used to sit at god's right hand
but i quit that show to do my one night stands.............
coming outta nowhere i'm a godhead rider.....
you won't see my face no more
my machine has left the floor
leave my rivals in the dirt
i've seen your world and i got the shirt
before i leave and go my way
i loved it but i couldn't stay
there's nothing left for you to feel
just remember me.....
you might see me in tokio
to the rings of saturn.....hey let's go
and you can trip all the lights with me
but your one time chance is never free.......
i'll see you baby once again
maybe 3 score years and ten.......
i'll be driving a different ship
"that when i'll take you down, for your final trip..........."
coming outta nowhere i'm a godhead rider.....
you won't see my face no more
my machine has left the floor
leave my rivals in the dirt
i've seen your world and i got the shirt.....
before i leave and go my way
i loved it but i couldn't stay
there's nothing left for you to feel
just remember me.....
"i feel pretty,"
"oh, so pretty,"
i feel pretty and witty and bright! and
i pity any girl who isn't me tonight.
"i feel charming,"
"oh, so charming"
it's alarming how charming i feel!
and so pretty
that i hardly can believe i'm real.
see the pretty girl in that mirror there:
who can that attractive girl be?
"such a pretty face,"
"such a pretty dress,"
"such a pretty smile,"
such a pretty me!
i feel stunning
"and entrancing,"
"feel like running and dancing for joy,"
for i'm loved
by a pretty wonderful boy!
"i feel pretty,"
"oh, so pretty"
that the city should give me its key.
a committee
should be organized to honor me.
"i feel dizzy,"
"i feel sunny,"
"i feel fizzy and funny and fine,"
"and so pretty,"
miss america can just resign!
see the pretty girl in that mirror there:
who can that attractive girl be?
"such a pretty face,"

"such a pretty smile,"
such a pretty me!
i feel stunning

"adapting to different surroundings,"
"changing your views day by day,"
too critical of others
when you too are at fault.
several sets of opinions
like colours to camouflage yourself.
"like a fox sly in your manãºuvres,"
too soon you'll get caught unawares.
"sometimes i feel pity,"
sometimes i feel hatred...
"sometimes you're my friend,"
sometimes you're my enemy.
i'll never give you the satisfaction
amuse me
sweet son of love
sweet son of death
adore me
and keep in every word i've said
time is a bitter foe
a bitter foe
until the end
and grace is like you my friend
my handsome one
my handsome one
dorian
time is jealous
time is pain
the gods will give
the gods will take
youth will wane
as age will gain
we'll turn into ashes
like ashes will turn into dust
will turn into dust
will fade will fade will fade
dorian
oh how sad it is
time is jealous
time is pain
oh how cruel
for me to know
each breath will take beauty away
if i stayed young and the picture
turned old
for that i would give everything
when our eyes first met
i should have left the room
i was growing cold and pale
fatality
the picture's a mirror
but to whom does it belong?
oh i damn the day
on that beautiful morning
am i modern sinner
or an ancient god
pray i pray
is there anything as pure as hate
for the prayer of my pride it has been answered
i can't free myself
from the spell of words
"the twisted limbs, the gaping mouth, the lifeless eyes"
forever we are gone
you shall stay with me
i wonder if there's heaven
i wonder if there's heaven
there's nothing left of me
dorian
oh how horrible
all the damage you have done
dorian
it's your beauty
time will take.

"catch a spirit, please can you hear me"
hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
he knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do
your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
the piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way
you watch the world exploding every single night
dancing in the sun a new born in the light
say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
hello to eternity and live for every breath
your time will come
your time will come
your time will come
your time will come
the ferryman wants his money you ain't gonna give it back
he can push his own boat as you set off up the track
nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
you watch the world exploding every single night
dancing in the sun a new born in the light
brothers and their fathers joining hands to make a chain
the shadow of the wicker man is rising up again
your time will come
your time will come
cannons pound into the night
angels soar into the sky
the battle rages on
deliverance unholy one
the seeds of hate fly tonight
good and evil light the sky
another vision from inside
i know it's wrong i can't deny
for seven years i have reigned
in this damned and desolate hell
now i've lived the masters vengeance
it saved me from myself
we paint the sky with blood tonight
setting free the damned to fight
the whore of babylon is here
the end of the storm is near
pure evil
feel the pain from the jackals wrath
pure evil
dance in flames for the final quest
hear the ghost of violence
fear the god of detriment
the land on earth is soaked with blood
hear the screams of the helpless ones
axes yield and daggers fly
ripping through all flesh in sight
we paint the sky with blood tonight
setting free the damned to fight
the whore of babylon is here
the end of the storm is near
pure evil
feel the pain from the jackals wrath
pure evil
dance in flames for the final quest

"""wake up abigail"", midday, henry was at her door"
the count would not rise 'til the afternoon and lunch was for two
so they talked about miriam and then abigail said:
"""what about little one?"""
"henry froze: ""oh, you mean our ghost?"""
"""downstairs on the lowest floor"
that's where you will find the door
beyond which there ware slippery stairs
leading down to the crypt
and little one sleeps there during the day
"but at night she'll rise, searching for her mom"
"don't you ever go there at night, it's a sinister place"
"there's so much pain, so much death, so much nothingness"""
[solo: andy]
when night time came on the second day and dinner it was done
jonathan's headache it was gone
"""miriam please take my hand"", then his mood really changed"
"""time is right to produce an heir"""
[solo: mike]
playing along with his eerie game she followed him up the stairs
up to a room where love they would share
to a room that smelled as if miriam was still in there
[solo: mike]
jonathan was a hideous sight
so abigail she hilled the candlelight
"what was to come, should have never been done"
she was blocking her mind from his awful thing
in her mind his moaning became
nothing but falling on slippery stairs
"falling and crying, crawling and dying"
at the end of the stairs
her eyes turned black in disgust
hating him more with every thrust
and then it was over before it begun
he was done... oh what a man
the only time he would call her mine
hey my lady in black
now i see your back
haven't seen you in a while
kinda miss your deadly smile
on a windy night
on a windy night
on a wicked night
on a wicked night
hey my lady in death
have you come for my last breath
i never thought
that we were through
i bet you knew i knew it too
i never thought
that we were through
i bet you knew that i knew it too
on a windy night
on a windy night
on a wicked night
on a wicked night
again i see you standing there watching me
"your gaze,"
those eyes are tantalizing openly
inviting me to get close to you
can't help myself
there's fascination in the air
i try to fight this strong sensation
but there's no chance
to escape from this temptation
"feels like i've known you before,"
repeating phrases
but i yearn for something more
i know i can't stay
by your side forever
"but i know, i won't forget your beauty"
my black diamond
i know i can't stay
by your side forever
"but i know, i won't forget your beauty"
my black diamond
i know i can't stay
by your side forever
"but i know, i won't forget your beauty"
my black diamond

as the sun falls down
and the swell crashes into the shore
the great warriors of doom and wind
ride high
"silent is the silence,"
"the only breathing of horses sound,"
"cold northern steel, shining blade, pleases us"
and we all live under the black mark
"oh lord, lead us to the paradise"
"my lord, is this the promised land"
is this your gift
let us fly into your dreams
let us taste some blood
sorrow - the unknown force
hate - respect your enemy
bitterness - shall be forever
silence - nothing left
let us fly into your dreams
let us taste some blood

"tonight ride the sky, tonight ride the sky"
the smile on his face turn me to stone
the words that he spoke

mars venus and stars
shaking their heads at me
no more todays tonight i'll be riding the sky
"tonight ride the sky, tonight ride the sky,"
tonight ride the sky
tonight ride the sky ...
it's a fairytale
and the story is out of date
nothing that i haven't tried to say

you know that this life is crazy
i will need some help
there's a place far below
the darkness deep within
it's a place i don't belong
come set me free from this oblivion
all inside of me
on the edge of agony
nothing left for me that i can think
you know that the road is lonely

new winds are blowing over the world can you feel it
message is spreading among all the people
"future is calling, history is leaving behind"
nobody is thinking about the past days
if you want to have a look in future world
if you have an open mind now it is your turn
come join our forces to this trip on the wings of tomorrow
concider that this world could be free from all this hatred
there would be no borders no laws of anykind yeah
"still mankind is falling, planning it's ruin everyday"
but hey we can still stop this madness together
if you want to have a look in future world
if you have an open mind now it is your turn
come join our forces to this trip on the wings of tomorrow
maybe it's the human nature pushing people to want more
"maybe you just can't get by with what you have, who knows"
once again it's all the same
then i guess you'll never learn
to live in peace without complaints
i can't stand it anymore
this was not the plan i drew
this ain't what we came here for
fire in eden once again
who will take the blame now?
"you took this heaven down, digging your own grave"
fire in eden once again
tell me where you run now?
wherever you may go things won't change
'cause the sin is you...you are the sin
"in the end it's all a failure, i can only feel the shame"
"for the people like you living with no peace, no smiles..."
you're the proof that god was right
when he kicked us out of eden the first time
you'll never learn...
i can't stand it anymore
this was not the plan i drew
this ain't what we came here for
fire in eden once again
who will take the blame now?
"you took this heaven down, digging your own grave"
fire in eden once again
tell me where you run now?
wherever you may go things won't change
'cause the sin is you...you are the sin
[may you all be damned! you quickly turned this heaven into the
"same hell we all left. there won't be any other chance, and anyway"
"it would be just useless to try. go on with your stupidity, see this"
"new world falling down and be happy, while we all die here!]"
the dessert in the blazing sun
i feel my throat is burning
the guard is incorruptable
you name it vanity or yearning - oh
now - dusty into my face
we gotta build it higher and higher
the sun is whipping from above
your child chains of desire
and craving towers
from the dessert towards the sky
the grind of the genius
who's raising his own decline
and the navigator is heading for hell
setting off on a journey
and he'll never return
and the navigator he rose and he fell
in quest for heaven
he'll never return
hey the seeker reaching for the stars
beyond the scape of profanity
oh and when he tried to touch the light
fire burned his sanity away
oh i gotta see it all
tempting deities i hear them
but then when you follow their call
pride goes before the fall
and the navigator...
my heart is frozen
my soul's been broken
the whole world's on my motherfucking shoulders
and i can't seem to control it
i can't contain it
and i just don't give a shit
you need to feel the way that i feel
but you'll never fuckin' know it
burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
you try but you can't reach me
burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
there is nothing you can't teach me
in hell
motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
i swear you'll have to give me
burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
i live but you won't let me
burn
your life's been wasted
you'll die forsaken
you have the world on your shoulders
but it's nothing so you fake it
do you embrace it
how do you take it
i'll never feel the way that you feel
i'd rather fucking brake it
burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
you try but you can't reach me
burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
there is nothing you can't teach me
in hell
motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
i swear you'll have to give me
burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
i live but you won't let me
burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn (3)
burn motherfucker burn
burn!
burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn (3)

school days teacher taught me everything
school days one and one is two
school days when i heard the school bell ring
school days there's nothing she won't do
she sees how hard it gets when she lifts up her dress
she licks her lips and says now put it to the test
she goes down faster than a sinking ship at sea
i don't need rescued 'coz she's going down on me
going down whoa teacher teacher's going down whoa
whoa going down whoa teacher teacher's going down whoa whoa
school days teacher taught me everything
school days one and one is two
school days when i heard the school bell ring

school days one and one is two
school days when i heard that school bell ring
school days there's nothing she won't do
school days ah ha ha school days

when the darkness eats away the
day
and the moon bears witness to the
graves
in the shadows we are alive
"in the shadows, the light"
can you see the ghosts above our
heads?
we are all in there with the dead
in the shadows we are alive
"in the shadows, the light"
solo: shermann
in the darkness there is no holding
back
there is no gold in black
deep in the night
everything is clear
clearer than daylight
in the land of mystery we share
you can come along if you dare
in the shadows we are alive
"in the shadows, the light"
solo: denner
we are hiding in the shadows on
your wall
we are watching as you kiss your
little doll
when the darkness leaves the night
we cannot see the light no more
no more
we are always in the shadows by
your door
but when the darkness leaves the night
we cannot see the light no more
no more
there is no holding back
there is no gold in black
deep in the night
everything is clear
clearer than daylight

my only comfort is in death
"my only solace, my dying breath"
"for release, i have prayed"
"thrown past life, not afraid"
"life's a bitch, life's a whore"
"nothing less, nothing more"
there is nothing she would do for me
i will end this suffering
existence of one man
hatred with no end
"my madness, my sadness"
i am my own savior
the voices are calling
"out of this life, i'm falling"
"there is one choice, that i see"
"in raging flames, the dark one awaits"
existence of one man
hatred with no end
"my madness, my sadness"
i am my own savior

conquest to the lover
and your love to the fire
permanence unfolding in the absolute
forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice
eloquence belongs to the conqueror
the pictures of time and space are rearranged
in this little piece of typical tragedy
justified candy
brandy for the nerves
eloquence belongs to the conqueror
you and me
we'll all go down in history
with a sad statue of liberty
and a generation that didn't agree
you and me
we'll all go down in history
with a sad statue of liberty
and a generation that didn't agree
i forgot to
i forgot to let you know that
justified candy
brandy for the nerves
eloquence belongs to the conqueror
conquest to the lover
and your love to the fire
permanence unfolding in the absolute
forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice
eloquence belongs to the conqueror

we'll all go down in history
with a sad statue of liberty
and a generation that didn't agree

we'll all go down in history
with a sad statue of liberty
and a generation that didn't agree

what is in us that turns a deaf ear
to the cries of human suffering
"suffering, suffering now"

belonging
belonging to
born into a neighborhood that ain't exactly rich
never knew his father and his mother was a bitch
oh no
didn't have a place to go
grown up in the streets
he learned to take just what he needs
violence and crime the only answer he believes
oh no
your emotions you don't show
how can you ever give up
when you never were scared?
how can you ever forgive
without learning to blame?
see the night
that's where you're living
feel the dark
that seems to follow you
see the stars
i see you crying
see the stars
you wished that one of them just shines for you
after you're gone
unemployed and full of hate
you're dealing with cocaine
one day you will end up with a needle in your brain
oh no
as you slowly go insane
how can you ever be good
when you don't see a reason?
how can you trust an old friend
when you don't even care for one?
see the night
that's where you're living
feel the dark
that seems to follow you
see the stars
i see you crying
see the stars
you wished that one of them just shines for you
after you're gone
all you know is what you see
you see society is treating you bad
"no more visions, no more hope"
"your future is a cold, cold cell"
i send you to hell
falling so deep into darkness
crawling so deep in the dark
give me a chance to regret what i've done
only if i can explain
see the night
that's where you're living
feel the dark
that seems to follow you
see the stars
i see you crying
see the stars
you wished that one of them just shines for you
after you're gone
this is the age of the dead.
the generation of pagan and self-led.
you can feel the bones shatter beneath our feet.
the blood of lust staining our teeth.
"we feed on pain (pain), disorder (disorder), delusion (delusion)."
the filth of the modern plague.
"and in this reign of godlessness, the heathens will say"
tie this around your neck. tie this around your neck.
tie this around your neck. tie this around your neck. fool.
save your breath my son. just carry on home.
time will prey on you and take you through hell.
ive heard every empty line.
"every curse, every word that you redefine."
i will turn my back on the coming storm.
"wont lie in the grave, i will be reborn."
they say
tie this around your neck. tie this around your neck.
tie this around your neck. tie this around your neck. fool.
"save your breath my son, just carry on home."
time will prey on you and take you through hell.
confusion reigns. pride of the hopeless herd.
"blind to the will, blind to the word."
they will drown in the rule of man. helpless and alone.
"save your breath my son, just carry on home."
time will prey on you and take you through hell.
they say
tie this around your neck. tie this around your neck. fool.
tie this around your neck. tie this around your neck.
fool... fool... fool.
crownless again shall be the queen
trophy on her grave remains unseen
a boat on the river confessing the sins
the riddler revealing the deep hidden things
crownless again shall be the king
a gull covered in oil with a broken wing
a hitcher on a road alone and lost
iron sharpens iron - a truth that once was
mine is the earth and the sword in the stone
mine is the throne for the idol
one fleeting moment and it is all gone
crownless again
will i fall?
roaming on razor-sharp castles
ruling all but myself
(now my night is laid to sleep)
one fragrant rose worth ten times what i am
a crippled begging a coin braver than i ever was
reflection from me - devil dressed in white
chasten the being become what i once was
mine is the earth and the sword in the stone
mine is the throne for the idol
one fleeting moment and it is all gone
crownless again
will i fall?
mine is the earth and the sword in the stone
mine is the throne for the idol
one fleeting moment and it is all gone
crownless again
will i fall?
"lonely nights i think of you,"
"my life, my king and my land."
land of war will turn into light
divine light will give us strength
sunlight divine cover my land
angels of light take care of us
still darkness surrounds myself
among the trees i saw the gates of hell
i hear that someone screams my name
devil claims for my life
sunlight divine give me the strength
angels of light show me the way
"flying up in the sky, riding through the wind"
until dawn things won't change at all
"strange sensations, fighting the evil in my heart"
angels of light help me save my land
stars guide me in this night
light my way to fight the dark
"god, i pray to you one more time"
with your help i'll save my land
sunlight divine cover my land
angels of light take care of us
"flying up in the sky, riding through the wind"
until dawn things won't change at all
"strange sensations, fighting the evil in my heart"
angels of light help me save my land.
"build an inner door, drop and then explore"
"you smoke your head on straight, then drink"
your woes away -
some might not understand possession
controls your head
"you recognize it, while some ignore it"
"avoid the masses, you've got to belong to it"
belong to it...
belong to it...
your music is your friend. but the roof
above my head. so seriously i take the will
that never breaks
"some might not understand, possession"
beyond your hands...
"you recognize it, while some ignore it"
"avoid the masses, you've got to belong to it"
"you recognize it, while some ignore it"
"avoid the masses, you've got to belong to it"
belong to it...
belong to it...
"it's power and sin, and then you've got all the other habits"
whiskey and smoke
"it's all that we could need, to plant the perfect"
"seed, disembody me - yeah..."
"you recognize it, while some ignore it"
"avoid the masses, you've got to belong to it"
belong to it...
belong to it...
i see the future coming
i'll tell you what's to be
a life turns into another
but no more i can't see
and i hold your hand
you said you'd never leave him
but now you let him go
someday he will forgive you
and stop to suffer so
a storm arrives with thunders
the end arrived with smiles
a life inside another
has made its ways through cries
and i hold your hand
"yes, i hold your hand..."
somedays we're covered up in sorrow
but still we're standing here
sometimes this life's too short
to understand
"someone, oh, please just let me borrow"
a little courage for my fears at night...
don't drift into a state of sadness
making something never seen
look under every stone along the way
"whatever happens, use your power,"
don't surrender to your fears at night...
"so, turn around,"
keep on moving now
hiiting every single road
just keeping on running on and on and on...
running on and on we face our fears
i remember why
"and though the dangers run so near,"
a rainbow fills the sky
the freedom lies over our heads
we must live before we die
"believe me, i remember why!"
there's a way
to melt down your frozen heart
just keep on living
"cause inside, your will"
never dies! oh no!
mutilated on the cross
blackness covered the bastards flesh
hear the trumpets of hell
see the fire through my eyes
black winged angel
reborn in chaos
necrodaemon terrorsathan
unholy sins inside my other hell
praise the lord of disrespect
let them die in their own curse
because they don't feel
black winged angel
reborn in chaos
necrodaemon terrorsathan

blutsathan - herrscher des stolzes

side by side they will see us ride
"but if they cared to look, than they would see"
"it's our return to fantasy, fantasy, fantasy"
"fantasy, fantasy, fantasy"

"there's a need to unwind, that's never been defined"

closer than ever before
"we can go on for you, and take you nearer to"
the legend of mystery from the beginning of time
dreaming... time... dreaming
we can return to the land of the good and the kind
time... dreaming... time... dreaming
why don't you come to our party and open your minds
"in another place, there's a newer face"
"like an unfinished painting, your creator is waiting"
"the brush and pen describe, what it is inside"
"that will set your mind thinking, while the others are sinking"
moonlight night after moonlight night
"side by side, they will see us ride"
"but if they cared to look, than they would see"
"it's just our return to fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, oh yeah"
"fantasy, fantasy, fantasy"
giving our blood
to the doomsday machine
fighting for ravaged land
a worthless gain
marching on a dead end road
a violent new disorder
feeding off mistrust
forgot what we were fighting for
a worthless aim
a victory stinking of despair
dead eyes
see no future
falling from grace
we are coming home
battalions of hate
seeking shelter in hell
bloodstained memories
will we ever be forgiven
our twisted fate
time will tell
one step back from a beat down maniac
i'm tired of taking a back seat from all the other demons
that are stealing all the good shit
leaving me with nothing but my hands
another stroke down my back tasting all the flames that are
licking around my neck and making me insane
"as they pull me down, pull me down into my grave"
i can't get away
"ooooh, it doesn't mean nothing"
until your deep inside dancing to the devil's swing
"whoa, it doesn't mean a god damn thing"
dancing to the devil's swing.
spit down inside i'm begging for another ride
i'm trying to find a way to keep it all and
satisfy the needs i'm craving and
i'm not taking it lightly
oh no!
"i'm living inside, a dead lie"
controlled by the devil's eyes and i don't mind it
draw my ace up and roll my snake eyes nightly
hold on baby!
"ooooh, it doesn't mean nothing"
until your deep inside dancing to the devil's swing
"whoa, it doesn't mean a god damn thing"
until your deep inside dancing to the devil's swing.
"whoa, dancing, dancing to the devil's swing."
play with my insanity
"live inside my darken dreams, my darken dreams"
hail to the devil's swing
"ooooh, it doesn't mean nothing"
until your deep inside dancing to the devil's swing
"whoa, it doesn't mean a god damn thing"
until your deep inside dancing to the devil's swing.
"whoa, it doesn't mean a god damn thing, a god damn thing"
dancing to the devil's swing.
this masochism is alive
my desire for skin is unnerving.
"flesh to flesh, the taste of the death, temptations rise."
"now if she could only speak we could set this everlasting,"
this girl in a box leaves me wanting more.
"this will be our little sweet six, six, six (in our love)"
"be still my love for we cannot be seen, (in our love)"
"this will be our six six six,"
be still my love for we cannot be seen
or they will surely take you away from me.
be still my love for we cannot be seen

"this will be our little sweet six, six, six (in our love)"
"be still my love for we cannot be seen, (in our love)"
"i slide inside the hell within,"
for there's nothing like her rotting skin.
i bet that i've fucked more dead girls than you. (2x)
oh this night kiss the inside...
"oh yeah, my desire for skin is..."
"i will turn you, turn you inside..."
the smell of romance is in the air...
"justice by us, revenge is a bitch"
now's the time to deal with it
where the system fails we now prevail
your innocence is my retribution
"eye for an eye, street justice"
in my mind
now's the time to face your lies
"you took her life, destroyed her dreams"
her suffering will be avenged
vengeance is mine - lynch mob
your day has arrived - lynch mob
justice is now - lynch mob
judgemen is served
street cleaner is my name
my justice will be my way
i removed the scum of the earth
intervention is on its way
now you face your judgement day
vengeance is mine - lynch mob
your day has arrived - lynch mob
justice is now - lynch mob
judgement is served
the lynch mob arrives- justified
your sick and criminal mind must be - crucified
vengeance is mine - lynch mob
your day has arrived - lynch mob
justice is now - lynch mob
judgemen is served

"they came out of nowhere,"
"from the land of the broken souls,"
"to build up a tower,"
with their flesh and their bones.
"they sailed across the seven seas,"
to break the seal of slavery
from beyond they heard the thunder
from the ship that went under the sea
the moon was shinin' bright
with his darkened purple light
to spread the wings of wonder
we had to find some place to hide
shadows in the darkness
"from a light down in the black,"
"we're dealing with danger,"
will we ever be comin' back again
ooh ho ho hooh ho ho
"hooh ho ho hooh, we ran through the fire"
ooh ho ho hooh ho ho
"hooh ho ho hooh, to touch the flames"
ooh ho ho hooh ho ho
"hoon ho ho hooh, we ran through the fire"
ooh ho ho hooh ho ho
"hooh ho ho hooh, to the black moon pyramid"
silent screams and noisy thoughts
"filled the air with danger,"
how can we escape from here
without the pain and anger.
"we crossed the dying fields of war,"
"lost in the world of (the) evil scores,"
"to get out of insanity,"
we went through the temple of eternity
we sailed across the seven seas
"to break the seal of insanity, oh hoo hoooh"
"we're slaves to the king, slaves to the king"
of the black moon
"we sailed away, we sailed away, to eternity"
"we were lost in the world, (continue page)"
"lost in the world, of misery"
"we crossed the field, crossed the field,"
"crossed the field, of the prince of darkness"
"the moon was shinin' bright,"
"with his darkened purple light,"
to the pyramid of the black moon
"we heard from the danger,"
"of the land of the stranger,"
"you better be aware, better be aware,"
"don't trust the shadow, don't trust the"
shadow of the black moon pyramid
upon by birth came close to death
i wore the night
dark skies tucked me in
stranded in the mire of sorrows
the lightless caves in ravines
the power rushed over me
the serpent ran me through
a moment stole my time
a might surged over me
my passage enchanted my the moon
the light with shadows blended
my delusion imprisoned me
my enemy destroyed me
a sword cleaved my skull
an arrow pieced my heart
a sword cleaved my skull
and the wind took my soul
somebody broke my bones
somebody tore my flesh
somebody broke my bones
somebody crushed my chest
the power rushed over me
the serpent ran me through
a moment stole my time
a might surged over me
stamp down the fools that god adore
tear down that lying spectre of the cenuries
let them die in their - their misery
"torture and spare not, for they feel not"

emptiness
as i watch the road go by
sometimes loneliness is better in disguise
secret sins opening a new world
i’m think i’toying
with a lighter side of evil
i can see you’re the best by far
down the road i’m heading on
lost in your spell tonight
i am melting inside
i’m a witness to your power
i’m addicted to your touch
soul breaker
you were sent
through the black and cold of night
in your presence i am paralyzed
you fill my head with everything i need to trust
there’s no hope for this
i will turn to dust
i can feel the chains of my heart
don’t know why i’m hanging on
lost in your spell tonight
i am melting inside
i’m a witness to your power
i’m addicted to your touch
soul breaker
these illusions have taken over all my nights
don't care to close my eyes anymore
another night awake and waiting for the dawn to come
?another....? falling to my dreams
"wake me up, make me see"
move this made up chains from me
give me faith and tell me this is only just a dream
will you see me if i ever loose my mind?
will you be there when the shadows are taking over?
and will you want me when the night is closing in on me
is there a way to stay away?
and never close my eyes
"wake me up, make me see"
move this made up chains from me
give me faith and tell me this is only just a dream
"wake me up, make me see"
take this made up chains off me
give me faith and tell me this is only just a dream
i can't separate the day from night
(can’t separate the day from night)
i see no difference between the dark and light
(no difference between the dark and light)
all my dreams are just a lie
(all my dreams are just a lie)
am i alive?
solo
"wake me up, make me see"
take this made up chains off me
give me faith and tell me this is only just a dream
"wake me up, make me see"
take this made up chains off me
give me faith and tell me this is only just a dream
ohhhhhhhhhhhh!
"wake me up, make me see"
take this made up chains off me
give me faith and tell me this is only just a dream
"wake me up, make me see"
move this made up chains from me
give me faith and tell me this is only just a dream
"(wake me up, make see ...)"
heavy metal breakdown
the music makes me wonder
what kind of spell i'm under
heavy metal is the game
i eat and breath and sleep it
i do believe i'll keep it
though i'll never be the same
"no, i'll never be the same"
heavy metal breakdown
guitar is slashing my ears
it hurts so bad i'm in tears
yet i just can't break away
the bass and drums will belt you
well they're enough to melt you
i gotta have it every day
i'm headed for a breakdown
lightening and thunder of sound
i think i got it pretty bad
"i was a nice girl, you see"
until this happened to me
this heavy metal drives me mad
it really drives me mad
"you know, i tried the new wave"
but i just couldn't behave
everyone tried to calm me down
"i said, ""i'm leaving you, boys"
"i gotta find the real noise,"
"i just can't hang around."""
i found the heavy metal
and this is where i'll settle
even though my ears are ringing
i just can't live without it
there ain't no doubt about it
take it away and i'll quit singing
[lead]
at night i wake up screaming
thank god i'm only dreaming
that there's no metal anymore
but then my ears are ringing
my vocal chords are stinging
and i'm not dreaming anymore
i'm headed for a breakdown
lightening and thunder of sound
i think i got it pretty bad
i just can't live without it
there ain't no doubt about it
this heavy metal drives me mad
it really drives me mad
heavy metal breakdown
[repeat]
heavy metal!
"started from the start, wearing out the headstones"
"was twice(?) was the right, taking out a life loan"
"hey old man, when i'm going six feet down"
"you gotta make that promise to me,"
a stained glass cross lay behind my head
"when taken by the undertaker, no questions anymore"
"it's higher then the black sky, it's lower than the floor"
"hey old man, when i'm going six feet down"
"you gotta make that promise to me,"
a stained glass cross lay behind my head
"i was just a young boy, my father sounded crazy"
"my death he couldn't bear to see, either joking, sleeping, or lazy"
"hey old man, when i'm going six feet down"
"you gotta make that promise to me,"

the coach stands
waiting just outside
just in case the queen
should want to take a ride
but she stays
safely locked away
she knows the world outside
can be so cold and grey
daughters of the queen
come outside and play
slip into the nighttime
before it slips away
her castle
looms into the sky
behind those walls
you'll never see
a fear fall from her eye
she seems content
to live her life all alone
but locked inside
those castle walls
her heart has turned to stone
daughters of the queen
come outside and play
slip into the nighttime
before it slips away
daughters of the queen
come let me hold your hand
isn't it about time
you need to feel a man
today her majesty has gone
in death's repose
it's much too late
she lies there all alone
alas the dreams
inside her heart
sleep forever silent
imprisoned by the dead
daughters of the queen
come outside and play
slip into the nighttime
my conscious froze
when i felt the cold embrace of the hand that crafted me
"i set my soul ablaze, i crawled through the nether"
and left a suicide letter next to my own severed head
i think i should be dead
but that's the beauty of selling yourself to sin
"but again, we are men craving winter's end"
wishing to live within our origin again
the door to immortality is shut
i can't take much more of the scent of mold
this sphere of madness burning in my gut
has trapped me in this house again
"mother, i pray that your voice sings me to sleep"
to save my sanity
from the sound of this blood-soaked symphony
"father, i pray that your hand is warm again"
my pain will never end until you both come back to me
"i can feel the devil's presence, he never left this house"
now i can live my third depth fantasy
draw him straight to me
and drain every last drop from his arteries
a sacrifice of blood wakes the eye
it looks to turn this iron into gold
i place my hand upon the ancient god
i surrender my life
i bring the gift of resurrection
the power returns from which it came
now grant me what i have gifted
"mother, father come back to me"
in blood and bone i carve an oath
to save this boy from this shattered home
tonight we bathe in blood and drink
from the skull of the beast that left his heart so cold
in a perfect world we could take his whole family's soul
and fuel our hearts with the hate i have
for the beast in us all
"a glance to my eyes, deep within reveals"
this worn-out warrior's mind
i'm killing you by suffering
discomposure of a deepest kind
in the night i crave to feel your breath
and your touch like angel of death
in the dawn i'm in chains of beastial rage
and forced to make you dead
the chains get tighter around my throat
"i can give you no love, only dead-lift of pain"
in the dusk of evening i tuck you up with feather
forever i'll stand by your side
in the twilight of night i'm laughing
while cutting you hundred and thirteen times
"can't you see i am evil, double-edged razor"
child of eternal hate.
to torment you like a motherfuckin-whore
i'll make you cry forever more
i'd crawl through broken glass to you...
and your name is written in my very flesh
with the knife i'm still longing to use
in the night i crave to feel your breath
and your touch like angel of death
in the dawni'm in chains of bestial rage
and forced to make you dead
[music & lyrics: tobias sammet]
am i totally blind this time when i'm dreamin'
"the dreams that i fear, some call it nightmare"
"and some call it life, what is the sense of"
existing in here
and i think of the sadness when i'm dreamin' of
leavin' the pain i don't get all that madness
and it drives me insane
"now hear me cry, i'm in quest"
of the key to my fate
i might be nigh to the key
in the abyss of hate
annihilation in my brain
what is the price that we will be to pay
when will you lift our little poor souls
when will you take us oh lord away
oh when will we die
why to suffer to stand up right
we are victims of time
we have to fight till the end is in sight
what's the reason to carry on
what's the reason to fall
after days of living hall
"after we had to crawl,"
are we totally blind this time
can't you tell me the nexus of freedom
and pain and desires and hate
and even the holy ones
harmony dies
demons calling to hell
wise ways ye cannot sell
praying fools light their ways
night decends shrouds the day
unveil the hysterskies
immortal children cry
question of when and why
harmony dies
sacrifice the solstice
casting out the priestess
anger lingers in death
waiting the for the last breath
hell has no disguise
just look through satan's eyes
when dogs of war can fly
harmony dies
death is fighting with death
time shall feed on whats left
prophets on the altar
voicing his words of war
walk through their sacred fires
the halls of souls admire
but as the end grows nigh
harmony dies
you think this isn’t right.
you think you don’t deserve this.
but you keep working on.
the beginning of the end.
what do you think?
how much pain can she take?
before she’s fighting back.
and takes all you love away.
"you hurt, you kill, and now your time runs out!"
"you rapist, you murderer, you fucking liar!"
"her pain, her cries, all this is your demise!"
"you rapist, you murderer, you fucking liar!"
earth strikes back!

your cries remain unheard.
there’s no one left to listen.
they have been taken away.

"you rapist, you murderer, you fucking liar!"

with just a flick of the opal banded finger i will throw you into a
concentric mental decline.
"i control your elation, i control your"
depression.
"i take as i wish memory, clothed in a raiment noir. (i take you"
under my black wing.) i take you under my dark wing and nurture you in hate
"to dwell forever in a maison blanche. purity through corruption, who am i to"
blame when your basest instincts are realized?
love is a failure
hate is just another deadly trap
trust is just a moment in a life which you should
command
we've lost you!
"who, knows who?"
we've lost you!
pain is faking gain
profit is no relief
to lie is to justify another lie you take as truth
"who, knows who?"
we've lost you!
death is part of life
as peace a part of war
i just need to clear my mind to learn both sides
"who, knows who?"
we've lost you!
"time, it slips away"
a life that carries on
i remember telling you a dream
about a girl that i have seen
the kind that steels your heart away
then she fades into the night
"all i remember are her eyes,"
i wish she could be found
my heart can't feel her
my arms can't reach her
"but i want you back, i really need to see you"
"here with me, yeah"
"this is where you should be, oh"
"she's a fantasy, a vision i can't resist"
i search the darkness of my mind
trying to find the reason why
she's only in my dreams
wish she'd fade into the wind
will i ever see her again?
does she know i want her now?
my heart can't feel her
my arms can't reach her
"but i want you back, i really need to see you"
"here with me, yeah"
"this is where you should be, oh"
"this is where you should be, oh oooh...."
my heart can't feel her
my arms can't reach her
"but i want you back, i really need to see you"

"this is where you should be, oh"
"this is where you should be, oh"
"this is where you should be, oh"
"this is where you should be, oh"
"we've been apart a long time, it feels like years"
the memories bring tears
"good times, i think of all the good times"
to keep my sanity 'til i get home
"i know it's not how we planned it, it's crazy world out there"
just hold on to the world we share
i'll only be lonely for you
i'll only be lonely for you
"remember as life goes by, what we have will never die"
i'll always be waiting there for you
"how long, it doesn't matter how long"
cause time can never take you from my soul - no
good friends are hard to find - believe me it's true
i'll only be lonely for you

"came to in a hospital, had no clue where he was"
he looked down on himself
"he knew, that body ain't yours"
"you gotta get out of there, no inkling where to go"
and the voice said
"are you aware of what you're now, cerebrus one"
this is your inner positronic brain addressing you
you're the new breed meant to rule all the world
"i lead the way, unite with your kin"

"i’m not god, i’m a political man"
"a leader, a lawyer against tyranny"
we’re raising our hands against execution
we’re heading out for silent revolution
we’re trying to resist bloody persecution
we’re crying out for silent revolution
silent revolution
silent revolution
silent revolution
silent revolution
spoken: what difference does it make
"to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless"
whether the mad destruction is wrought
under the name of totalitarianism
or the holy name of liberty and democracy
and for that i had to died ???
the job is done and i go out
another boring day
i leave it all behind me now
so many worlds away
"i meet my girl, shes dressed to kill"
and all we gonna do
is walk around to catch the thrill
on streets we call the zoo
"we eat the night, we drink the time"
make our dreams come true
and hungry eyes are passing by
on streets we call the zoo
"we eat the night, we drink the time"
make our dreams come true
and hungry eyes are passing by
on streets we call the zoo
enjoy the zoo
and walk down 42nd street
you wanna be excited too
and you will feel the heat
"we eat the night, we drink the time"
make our dreams come true
and hungry eyes are passing by
on streets we call the zoo
"we eat the night, we drink the time"
make our dreams come true
and hungry eyes are passing by
on streets we call the zoo
it was a day when the sun cried out
it was a moment to burden the doubt
whatever lingers will never reveal
whatever leftover wishes conceal and it's clear
like the rain:all my fears define who i am
"and i hear loud and long, everywhere, a mythical song"
"hung in the sky, a lonely star"
caught in the twilight it dances apart
stuck at the gates where the dead stepped
in a subtle hollow spreads out from within and i see
all the way what my eyes could never convey
"and it´s near,closer now everywhere,a mystical sound"
"oh... let me know don't fly away, i'm here"
i need to know when will the rain pour down again
"coming down over us, washing the past with a smile"
to the top of the hill
reach out the sky awake from the dream
"now i know we'll fly away,we´re free"
here we go the falling rain will come again
"no matter where or when,it will pour down in the end."

"you come to me, eyes full of grief"
you ask of me to shed all my tears
to let him return from kingdom of fears
why should i weep? or lose any sleep?
he never brought me pleasure or glee
so why would i help to set balder free
"you come to me,eyes full of grief"
all of your tears mean nothing to me
so why will you not just leave me to be
"am i to blame? well, i'm not ashamed!"
oh how i smiled when i heard the tale
"of loke the sly, so clever and brave"
"höder the fool,lopt's willing tool"
he held the twig that cut balder's skin
lopt aimed the shot
that killed höder's twin
leave me alone
don't come here and moan
i've never wished to see balder's well
so let his soul remain down in hel
my name is töck and i won't cry
i won't let balder return
let hel keep her treasured prize
let his soul forever burn
you come to me and cannot believe
that this old crow now talking to you
is loke not töck you bloody dawn fools
you come to me and you do not see
all of your tears mean nothing to me
why will you not just leave me to be
"my name is töck,and i won't cry"
i won't let balder return
let hel keep her treasured prize
let his soul forever burn
seeping gas from a broken line
chokes the midnight air
pilot light will ignite
so begins the reign of terror
flashing fire blazing hot
exploding flames did blow
sleeping innocent unaware
caught inside the inferno
burning
on fire
burning
burning down
fire in the night
fire in the night
fleeing fast from flickering flames
escaping death and cremation
fire fighters set to battle
to control the situation
fire in the night
they watched their dreams go up in smoke
a lifetime's work laid waste
and all that once lay dear to them
in embers lay erased
in embers lay erased
seeping gas from the broken line
choked the midnight air
the pilot light that did ignite
began the reign of terror
a castle that was once a home
only ashes remain
nothing left but memories
just cinders down the drain

darkness fills the life
covers the tired mind
like the darkest damnation
"anxiety, oppression"
a wounded soul
manages to escape
"from exhausted body,"
from the bleeding prison
"disengagement, dark visions,"
forgotten personality
feeling of loss
nocturnal suffocation
tears like blood
stench of decayed
alone...
without a body
life...
is turned to hell
living in emptiness
torture of the timeless
into the black pieces
of total chaos and sorrow
no blessing
no chances to survive
leads the way
to infernal death
"disengagement, dark visions"
forgotten personalities
a scent of rain
a healing breeze
is blown into my face
to feel desire
and raise my head
to gaze at the sky
and watch the setting sun
breaking through
the darkened clouds
and i feel that i
am still alive an breathe
for all the world to see
you can bind my blood
but the spirit will remain
for all the world to see
no matter what you can claim
the spirit will remain
they wanna see me down
on my wounded knees
wanna see me cry
but my eyes
have run out of tears
when there's nothing left to pay
just a little light of day
i got something
you can't take away
fly away
far away
deep inside
shelter for my spirit and my pride
for all the world to see
you can bind my blood
but the spirit will be free
forevermore...

"living life, don't you cry. my life -- pain is god."
"many nights, painful thoughts occur. love me -- again i'm wrong."
in denial i tried to be your friend. i tried to be a good boy.
"all i see, a hate deep inside. startle me, someone save me."
all these memories
fill my heart
they bury me
all i want to do.... (you are not my real mother) x4
is kill you.... (so i beat and stab and fuck her) x4
looking back i was never ever right.
you were my step mom you always wanted me out of your sight.
"i would come walkin' in and i'd say, ""hello,"""
but you'd slap me and make some fucked-up comment about my clothes.
"but i tried to let it pass, but the visions in my head were with you with a knife up your ass laying dead."
so i popped some more caps in your ass.
now your son is such a fuck -- motherfucking bitch
never try to play me!
you make my life -- not so....
all i want to do....
is kill you....
all i want to do.... (you are not my real mother)
is kill you.... (so i beat and stab and fuck her)
wish! you! were dead! now!
how.... i know
how can i cry over someone i never loved?
how can i cry over someone i never loved?
never loved.... never loved
all these moments of pain
must add up to something
our bodies have been trained to keep it all in
but our hearts still hold on
"some say to release it, forget about your past"
"instead we count the cost, it's part of us"
that doesn't mean that we cannot move on
it's just a memory of what we once were
no matter what it is we've faced
it's now part of us (part of us)
we can overcome
why rid of fuel that can make us stronger
when properly put behind us? (put behind us)
and in the same way that
everything good in life can be taken away
so can all this pain
no matter what it is we've faced
it's now part of us (part of us)
no matter what we've faced in this life
we can overcome
trying to forget is a burden we can never bear
when facing trials openly
there's nothing left to hide
new paths of strength come alive
we can overcome
no matter what it is we've faced
it's now part of us (part of us)
no matter what we've faced in this life
we can overcome
the intense grasp death's strangle-hold has over me
confines me to my own personal agony
"set me free, let me go"
release the chilling grasp with which it clutches me
the earth issues it's extreme unction
as i realise my punishment for sin
enguifed by death for all eternity
in my bones i no longer feel the cold
as the mire unbosoms it's secrets to me
"ubiquitous fetidness, death is everywhere"
"my god, unshackle me"
my suffering grows with increase of my guilt
destroy devotion. be at one with the earth
i sink down into the clammy soil
at one with the earth.
these stories given to us all
are filled with sacrifice and robes of lust
dissonant choirs and downcast eyes
selfhood of a condescending ape
behold the crown of a heavenly spy
forged in blood of those who defy
"kiss the ring, praise and sing"
he loves you dwelling in fear and sin
fear is a choice you embrace
your only truth
tribal poetry
witchcraft filling your void
lust for fantasy
male necrocracy
every child worthy of a better tale
pick your author from à la carte fantasy
filled with suffering and slavery
you live only for the days to come
shoveling trash of the upper caste
smiling mouth in a rotting head
sucking dry the teat of the scared
a storytelling breed we are
a starving crew with show-off toys
fear is a choice you embrace
from words into war of the worlds
this one we forsake with scorn
from lies the strength of our love
mother's milk laced with poison for this newborn
"wake up child, i have a story to tell"
once upon a time
can you hear the thunder rolling (*)
somewhere in the night
twenty thousand voices screaming
blinded by the light
makes no difference who you are
or where you're going to
the sound of fury splits the night
above the chosen few
welcome to the nightmare
let the show begin
baptism of fire
take the eagles from the sky
and ride into the sun
"make a stand, the time has come"
the tournament's begun
"throw the dice, spin the wheel"
turn the card of fate
the day is coming soon my friend
you don't have to wait
welcome to the nightmare
let the show begin
baptism of fire
(repeat *)
welcome to the nightmare
let the show begin
we're on a mission for the rock
this music carousel will shake and shock you
we are the melody and rhyme
"the story must be told, it's in my mind yeah"
a vision dancing to the grave
this is the fire of the lonely brave ones
before our dreams fall out of time
until the end we raise the metal sign
bring heavy rock to the land
"it's never over, the crown is in our hands forever"
play rock and roll for every man
"the song is the tower, it feeds us the power."
be the crusader and the rock of the road
follow your destiny don't fake your future
even winds can turn you blind
life it holds the pain to break and crack you
before my heart runs out of breath
until the dawn of darkness
and to my death i
bring heavy rock to the land
"it's never over, the crown is in my hands forever"
play rock and roll for every man
this is the hour of magic and power
the night is my tower - yeah
"oh, this life was never easy"
but it's fate
i got to stay and deliver
"time, is there no end to all our crime"
it's crying in my mind
so many countless centuries of sorrow
dark winds will haunt inside
the new tomorrow
i'm on a mission for the rock
this music carousel will shake and shock you
we are the melody and rhyme
"the story must be told, it's in my mind - yeah"
my vision dancing to the grave
this is the fire of the lonely brave one
before our dreams fall out of time
until the end we raise the metal sign
bring heavy rock to the land
"it's never over, there will always be a band that wants to"
play rock and roll for every man
"the song is the power, it builds me the tower - yeah"
(bring heavy rock to the land)
(play rock and roll for every man)
"with the magic of the sun we will burn and run, yeah"
"all you children of the night, we will rock all right"
"come on and rock, rock, rock."
so now we talk about destruction
a human race that's left to die
nobody ever will believe it
until we face it eye to eye
let us talk about hell
our future shines in darkest colours
"you'll never change it, never will"
ain't nothing left now to believe in
and so we face the overkill
hey mother mercy leave me be
do you expect me now to cry
time will wait for noone
time is short as hell
"time, time, time is short as hell"
"all is lost, into the underworld we fade"
until our live is gone
count the cost
then from the darkness whiped away
into the underworld we fade
where the darkness awaits
time will wait for noone
"time is short as hell, hell, hell"
time...
we focus on your death
we focus on your death
"you share not the blood of ours, ours, ours"
thus we focus on your death
for so long i was deceived
enslaved by these chains
blinded to your forgiveness
if only i knew your love
giving your life to save me from this pain
broken and bleeding i turned you away
now i have seen the scars inflicted by my hands
the innocence spilled to save me
reaching to the hand that brought you this pain
and now i am on my knees
crying the way you wept for me
"crying, crying tears of shame"
"dying, dying to take away their pain"
i hear the screams of those who call from the grave
dying for me to take their pain
i immaterialize
and slowly drift
into the unknown
with the cold winds with soul
the wintery plains lie untouched
i ride on my elements
towards the stars unseen
a quest
for knowledge
in the
astral
luminous
stench intensifies
as i
near a spectral sphere
after a hundred
men's lifetime
in analyzing
i learn
to consume
the sphere
of immense power
and to
become immortal
darkness hate and winter
rules the earth when i return
war
between races
a goal is reached
"chaos, hate"
chosen by fate
conflict and fire
the gathering of souls
the eternal pyre
born with blood in his hand
take this world
and all that you can
ambitions of wrath
bringing forth
the burning of deserts
to the frozen north
spare no lives
war upon war
the horses ride
forevermore
betrayed
seeking storms of revenge
the punishment of god
shall bring the end
look me in the eyes and drown...
"""everyone considered the man in the blue jacket"
as the most beautiful human being they have ever seen:
nuns saw on him the messiah in flesh;
satan's adorers the lustrous prince of darkness;
philosophers the supreme being;
young females an enchanted prince;
"men an ideal reflection of themselves."""
"patrick sä¹»kind: the perfume (""story of an assassin"")"
look me in the eyes and drown...
"i am your vulture, your immoral sculpture"
"mirrorman, who understands"
"i know you, i am you"
your fantasy and reality
i wait for you to welcome you in my dreamworld
my water-eyes
look me in the eyes
touch me in the eyes and dream...
your self-determined place of value
think before you act!
can you justifiably criticise
a situations development
sometimes there's only a single path
which we have to walk
you realise before you even speak
that we're standing in a one-way street
why should we retreat? - to satisfy your gain?
think hard - tell me
what's your actual thoughts?
could you even give your brain the time of day?
i'm not defending things i've said or done
but let he without sin
cast the first begrudging stone
i the truth be known
your desire to judge unchallenged
and revel in the according attention
tear dimmed remembrance
in the womb of time
breath upon me
possessed by the passion
fate will set you free
infertile
chaste be the precious
when flesh is an enemy
fair-weather man
step aside from the way of a better man than you
so you fall at his feet he's the one who betrays you
it's the servant's devotion for the decay
stand up
there are no flowers on your grave
there are no chains
there i keep chanting for the forgotten name
why you feel so empty
and still have everything
it's fulfillment
i've got more companions
when i'm all alone
flesh is fetching
mother come pick me up
i feel i've lost all that i knew
in this forest full of lies
you're all that's ringing true
"oh, by my world"
black pearl
forever my world
black pearl
gather all that's left
place my fears up on this shelf
now i feel alive
as i'm no longer by myself
launch the silver spear
the world will cry a tear
in the heavens will appear another angel
hear the elders cry
waiting for their time
as they look towards the heavens
why won't they answer?
we are playing with nature
splitting the atom
confusing religions
killing the masses
we are not separate from what we destroy
time has come for us to make the only choice
we are not separate from what we destroy
time has come for us to make the only choice
we rape for our power
not caring for life
we tarnish our waters
'til they are as black as night
we visualize the future
with the eyes of the blind
we hear nature calling
but we still deny
we are not separate from what we destroy
looking back i still have so many questions
so many things unanswered
like what did i do?
what could i do?
was there ever a moment you cared?
was i always ugly and abbanded
remember all the times you wished me harm?
you wished me dead
how can i have changed to make it better?
and would i?
would i?
would i
i still feel so much hate inside of me
seems like you were just waiting for me to fail
i'm sorry i can't forgive you
do you blame me?
you never forgave me
i've tried to grow from this
every day is a new challenge
because with you there is just no winning
like it ir not i'm still a part of you
and you're still a part of me
like it or not you're still a part of me
yeah
so this is how it is
"all the tears, all the blood"
it's all gone for nothing
"as the candle dwindles, then freakes out"
in the end
you've got the smile of judas on your lips...
you're following your script
trying to hide your anger
i see a cheap facade upon your face... to cover your distaste
it can't confine your rancor
"extend your olive branch, but it's all full of thorns"
"you're talking peace, but in your eyes"
is a bucket full of hate... a bucket full of hate
bucket full of hate... (hate)
you're coming under false pretense
you're trying to make amends... it's a counterfeit production
yeah this performance is just a sham... it's nothing but a scam
a bogus reconstruction
"extend your olive branch, it's just a masquerade"
you're talkin' peace and love
you try to camouflage your animostiy
you're getting crushed beneath the weight...
of a bucket full of hate... (bucket full of hate)
a bucket full of hate... (bucket full of hate)
bucket full of hate... hate!!!

home on the highway
home isn't my way
home will never be
burn out the day
burn out the night
i can't see no reason to put up a fight
i'm living for giving the devil his due

i'm not the one to tell you what's wrong or what's right
i've seen signs of what (freezing their eyes) went through
"well i'm burning, i'm burning, i'm burning for you"

i'm living for giving the devil his due

when i look back upon my life
it's always with a sense of shame
i've always been the one to blame
for everything i long to do
no matter when or where or who
"has one thing in common, too"
"it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin"
it's a sin
everything i've ever done
everything i ever do
every place i've ever been
everywhere i'm going to
it's a sin
at school they taught me how to be
so pure in thought and word and deed
they didn't quite succeed
for everything i long to do
no matter when or where or who
"has one thing in common, too"
"it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin"
it's a sin
everything i've ever done
everything i ever do
every place i've ever been
everywhere i'm going to
it's a sin
"father forgive me, i tried not to do it"
"turned over a new leaf, then tore right through it"
"whatever you taught me, i didn't believe it"
"father, you fought me, 'cause i didn't care"
and i still don't understand
so i look back upon my life
forever with a sense of shame
i've always been the one to blame
for everything i long to do
no matter when or where or who
"has one thing in common, too"
"it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin"
it's a sin
everything i've ever done
everything i ever do
every place i've ever been
everywhere i'm going to - it's a sin
"it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin"
"it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin"
honey it's getting close to midnight
and all the myths are still in town
true love and lipstick on your linen
bite the pillow make no sound
if there's some living to be done
before your life becomes your tomb
you'd better know that i'm the one
so unchain your back door invite me around
"bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter"
"let her go, let her go, let her go"
honey it's getting close to daybreak
the sun is creeping in the sky
no patent remedies for heartache
just empty words and humble pie
so get down on your knees honey
assume an attitude
you just pray that i'll be waiting
cos you know i'm coming soon
"so pick up your foolish pride, no going back"
"no where, no way, no place to hide"

scenting the bent in her veins
stripped and readied for torture

ten times the hecatomb
a thousand souls for those church-murdered
dark ken align to render doom
their punishment overdue
striking unbiblical chords that roar
invoke raw branded skies
as forked lightning feeds the hordes of war
her broken hands revive
"for sisters, missed, once powerless"
tongues torn out by the root
fell whispers rose to a seething congress
of spirits born for death's pursuit
never a dusk so drunk on lust
caressed the cobbles red
"frights she called, the flights of ghouls"
left little of their brittle flesh
judgment night descended
like the bonfire's fall of ashes
inquisitioners slaughtered
venting the dent in her brain
"stripped and readied, debauchees"
prepared to stain
the gist of humanity taught her
"intolerance, murder in vein"

since i was a child
lay awake at night
tucked into my darkened world
'til the morning light
served my time upon this earth
angel to my side
hidden out among the thieves
this place to die
[…]
the one who's watchin' over my shoulder - get a life!
"i see your arms are nailed to the cross, but your eyes are so alive."
"i never thought you're lying but now it's turned around,"
"so many hearts are dying - you let them down,"
over and over again...
"can't reach you, can't meet you,"
i give you everything i've got.
"you hear me, don't leave me,"
"it's my message to you, god."
"can't see you, can't feel you,"
"i've lost just everything i've got,"
"forget me, you've left me,"
"it's my message to you, god..."
we're busy burnin' witches the way we learned from you.
"we're good at killing creatures, so teach us something new, come on!"
"one of your own creations is kind of hard to understand,"
"you, freak of nature - just tell me why did you create us man?"
"traces on the floor, i can't hear the door closing me."
"right inside my dream, it's a sign from him - let me be."
sunrise through the dust - future is the past chasin' me.
"shadows on the wall, voices down the halls calling me,"
over and over again...
"hail mary, full ov disgrace"
the lord has fornicated with thee
cursed art thou among men
and possessed
cunning as shroud ov turin
on the autopsy ov god
damnata virgo maria
credo undone
bitch ov a sybilline vulva
usurpress and liar
witch of broken vows
centuries wept because ov thee
where art thou now in the hour ov trial?
cunning as shroud ov turin
on the autopsy ov god
creatio ex nihilo
credo undone
"wretched is the fruit ov thy womb, babylon!"
"holy mother, mother ov god"
"pray for us not, the sinners"
now and at the hour ov our death
amen
reproach envelopes me. a hierarchy through violence - street
society.
street society. i voice my contempt.
convinced of my immunity.
"yet on a smaller scale, in my conflicted world, my resistance is"
stretched.
you sense and provoke.
"you mock and degrade my friends and aims, tempting drastic actions -"
baiting me.
"my shame turning, turning to rage!"
"twisting the knot inside, the final strains of restraint discharged."
"acceleration of loathing, driving my physical force."
"the shameful act, the feelings of angst, i considered myself"
incapable.
"lay blame with me for the ""bastard"" that i am, (you're) too stupid"
our way of emptiness outside the burning wall
"rise again, this quest for our salvation"
"gunning faster than the savage laughter, the daylight fades away"
nothing left but the life we left behind
"ever searching the hidden faces, the hatred boils inside"
broken down and the far below destroyed
"light years away, empty worlds between us"
"so turn away, say goodbye for the last time tonight"
"still lost within the lonely, a lifetime ago"
hanging on as we pass through the fields
these pieces of our lives will lead the long journey home
and the wounds never heal
so fly for the last time while the fire burns within
silently we stand in a long forgotten wasteland
"rise through the lost ages, hope they will bring"
free forever more and the dream will never die
"devastation, the lost connection, it weighs down many tons"
so confused and alone for one more time
"crushed, defeated, the force surrounded, the free stay trapped inside"
"system down, feel the raging war tonight"
"time after time, promises of freedom"
will leave the past behind and strike for the first time tonight
still mystified by lack of privation they show
after all of the trials we?ve been through
these memories of empty worlds were all lost in vain
and the scars never heal
so fly for the last time while the fire burns within
silently we stand in a long forgotten wasteland
"rise through the lost ages, hope they will bring"
free forever more and the dream will never die
fly for the last time while the fire burns within
silently we stand in a long forgotten wasteland
"rise through the lost ages, hope they will bring"
free forever more and the dream will never die
fly for the last time while the fire burns within
silently we stand in a long forgotten wasteland
"rise through the lost ages, hope they will bring"
free forever more and the dream will never die
"woah, and the dream will never die"
lay your hands upon me
give me the certainty to fulfill my destiny
fill my soul with lightas it courses through my veins like a river after rain
healer
seeker
true believer
summon the storm to smite deceivers
through the perils we face
(we overcome)
through the treacherous days
(we overcome)
nothing stands in our way
sure as the sun will rise again
take my words
let them feed humanity
a sacrifice to demonstrate
a willingness to take the hate
and use it as our strength
healer
seeker
true believer
summon the storm to smite deceivers
through the perils we face
(we overcome)
through the treacherous days
(we overcome)
nothing stands in our way
sure as the sun will rise again
we gave our souls to the will of the fates tonight
"with honor, the brave will live far beyond this life"
"pulled from the darkness, reborn in light"
through the perils we face
(we overcome)
through the treacherous days
(we overcome)
nothing stands in our way
sure as the sun will rise again
we overcome
sure as the rising sun

a single silent bullet
flying through the air
will it find it's target
fate will take it there
who's name is written on it
no one has a clue
will it find a victim
could be you
i have seen the angel
the messenger of death
riding out across the crimson sky
he comes to take another soul
away from the sanctuary
he who plays the game
must surely die
but someone has to pay the ferryman
to sail across the sea of life
someone has to pay the ferryman
to sail across the sea of life
sea of life
sea of life
your life is held in balance
on a slender silken thread
weaving through the tapestries of time
we can walk the road together
can you take me by the hand
maybe we can find your promised land
i can hear the darkness falling
somewhere in the night
reaching out across the cold black sky
could this be a twist of fate
your written destiny
or could the angel simply pass you by
someone has to pay the ferryman
to sail across the sea of life
someone has to pay the ferryman
to sail across the sea of life
sea of life
sea of life
someone has to pay the ferryman
to sail across the sea of life
to sail across the sea of life
a single silent bullet
flying through the air
will it find it's target
fate will take it there
who's name is written on it
no one has a clue
will it find a victim
could be you
could be you
could be you
could be you
"could be, could be you"
sea of life
could be you
sea of life
"could be, could be you"
sea of life
could be you
sea of life
could be you
sea of life
could be you
sea of life
"could be, could be you"
sea of life
"could be, could be, could be you"
sea of life
i gave and gave - gave all i had
i took and took - all i could grab
i had it all and i had none
now the game is over and it's all gone
my heart is worn out to keep beating
my lungs exhausted by all this breathing
my mind's too tired to keep grieving
i was against and i was for
i wanted less and wanted more
"i won i lost, i lost and won"
now it's all over and i am done
my throat is too sore for more screaming
my eyes too swollen for more weeping
my wounds are too dry for more bleeding
my blood too drained for more streaming
my heart is slowing down
long short is life is short and long
strong weak am i am weak and strong
my crop is ready for the reaping
my being ready for releasing
my heart is slowing down
"(dokken, brown, pilson)"
picture yourself in a river drowning inside your heart
finding there is no tomorrow only this place that you are
that you are alone in your darkness let your spirit go
when judgement comes it'll lay by the side of the road
by the road
leaving all the worlds behind it seems so vain to me
think' bout the past i only see my broken youth
locked inside a world where only liars seem to live
not a chance for happiness
his mother's checkered past
psychologically induced by all the things he'd seen
what the hell is going on inside
thou shall not give unto life without love
what price for life
for ye shall open the scar of the wound
what price for truth
thou shall not take from the weaker mankind
what price for youth
fate begets sorrow the trail of doom
i can see the visions it's emitting from you mind
dig another grave so i can bury you alive
you're a poison ocean that's been running through the rye
what the hell is going on inside
what price for life
what price for truth
what price for youth
schizophrenic symptoms of a problem in your past
handed down to newborn generations to be cast
take your friend's emotions and dissolve it with a lie
put your plague to rest when you fall down and fucking die
and the mother cried
and the child cried
and the father replied
i guess i went to far
i guess i went to far
i guess i went to far
then he heard a voice and it said
"""now it's time to go, your soul is getting cold"
"i'm gonna leave your spirit dead by the side of the road"""
still the child cried on and on
"all i hail, hail me back"
feel my aim look through me now
"come to me, fly in me"
get on the top and throw it down my soul
i burn it all here comes the sun
ask your goal to lead your dream
stay on line speak the truth
walk my path bright and clear
i lead your soul i send you through
send a prayer to those who felt
peace & love in der welt
read me well between the lines
for i'm what i meant to be
forgive me now
forget me not
hold your fight
take that light
we don't need another war
let shine inside what we send you here
"all i heal, heal me back"
let heaven shine on all my sins
turn the wheel move your will
to where your wish is guided to
just wait for a while
'till what you ask comes down your way
ask your goal to lead your dream
stay on line speak the truth
walk my path bright and clear
i lead your soul i send you through
send a prayer to those who felt
peace & love in der welt
read me well between the line
for i'm what i meant to be
what i meant to be...
[october '91]
this is war
i lie wounded on wintery ground
with hundred of corpses around
many wounded crawl helplessly around
on the blood red snowy ground
war
"cries of the (ha, ha) suffering sound"
cries for help to all their dear moms
war
many hours of music
many drops of blood
many shiverings and now i am dead
and still we must never give up
war
"vilely i defile, chastise, humiliate"
"writhing, agonised as i violate to impregnate"
with lathering soaps and suds i slowly emenize
innards gurgulate as they're sickly baptized...
your rectum i will flood
"with bleach, detergents and suds..."
rupturing your gall-blader
liver bleached and soaked
lungs now flooded
with bicarbonates and boiling soap
orifices pumped and plugged
rectal membrane split
evaporating your bowels
anal muscle rips...
"i grope in the grime, the evaporating motions slush"
"pulverising your gut, in my rubber boots and gloves"
"your nates purple and raw, brillo pads scour and cleanse"
"sticking plasters on abrased organs, to try and make amends..."
...scour...abrase...scrub...erase....
your innards i corrode
this process you will loathe
your innards i evacuate
with my crude methods of hate
anal track acidically removed
along with rotten entrails and stools
disembowelling in my rage
in your colostomy you suffocate
...scour...abrase...scrub...erase....
sadistically sodomizing with my instruments of grime
force-feeding it down your throat if i find the time
vaseline and talc soothe the gored ano-obliteration
sardonically i gloat on your rectal dislocation
seething with carnage lust
as the plastic tubing in enthrust...
rupturing your gall-blader
liver bleached and soaked
lungs now flooded
with bicarbonates and boiling soap
orifices pumped and plugged
rectal membrane split
evaporating your bowels
anal muscle rips...
"the anus sucked inside out, my victim now distraught"
"rectal tissue i scald, as i boil the inner core"
"the orifice now clean - sanitised, red and raw"
"brutally impaling your rectum, this process i adore...."
...scour...abrase...scrub...erase....
your innards i corrode
this process you will loathe
your innards i evacuate
with my crude methods of hate
anal track acidically removed
along with rotten entrails and stools
disembowelling in my rage
i've seen pictures of a bright sun shining
and i know it
i've heard stories of a child not yet out of place
"so well, i remember this"
through it all i've learned so much about you
what a dirty shame
so blinding a self righteous point of view
how many fingers is this
"you can't take it all back, take it back"
"you did it, you said it now you will regret it"
"you can't take it all back, take it back"
"you did it, you said it now you will regret it"
you can't wreck my world with the things you do
how many fingers is this
"you can't take it all back, take it all back"
"you did it, you said it now you will regret it"
now you're gonna regret it
it started just like a dream
it started just like a dream
smiles turned upside down
good times 180 around
what a devil your god has made of you
how do his world taste
and which finger does he use when he points at you
i bet i know this
you can't take it all back (...)
why did you cross the line i drew
only you can adore you
and why did you throw the words you threw
i can never forgive you
only you can adore you
you can't take it all back (...)

whatever you may say
"how long you want to stay,"
tomorrow's yesterday
we're tomorrow's yesterday.
it seems we've tried too much
"to keep the status, to longer the touch"
of what we are today. afraid of change we see
and interprete eternity like it's a static way.
whatever you may say
"how long you want to stay,"
tomorrow's yesterday
we're tomorrow's yesterday.
"and if we just accept the things,"
it's hard to bring us down.
'cause if we try to force the will
we break the rules and feed the firestorm.
afraid of death we are
"we close our eyes from where we are,"
a point of no return. misunderstanding that
the person we are is another step
for ourselves to learn.
whatever you may say
"how long you want to stay,"
tomorrow's yesterday
we're tomorrow's yesterday.
if we will try to let it go we open ways to get.
"we better do a step aside, give room to grow,"
not feed the firestorm.
"come with me, it's hard to make you see"
"just what it means to be,"
why can't you see.
"rising high, i know we have to try. don't give it up"
for lies. why can't you try.
talk to me. i'll try to make you see just what it
"means to be, just let it be..."
"time is so relative, in secrecy we're learning to live"
and nothing was in vain.
"we'll stand the rest of time,"
discovering the inner divine.
the rules made not the game.
whatever you may say
"how long you want to stay,"
tomorrow's yesterday
put your tie on and tug up
hide yourself behind
your three piece suit
to fool the world
and gamble on and on
raise your stake go for round lot
take our worldly goods
and waste our money
that we gave to you in trust
in trust
corrupt curator
you cheat the gallows and decamp
conviction
we're goin' to get ya
conviction
we're gonna burn your hiding place
style your hair and grease your hands
"constrict your big, fat belly"
with a belt and play
the games you play the best
at last
always been a bucketeer
made good gain by accident
and climbed the ladder
with our money and estate
sorry fate
corrupt curator
you cheat teh gallows and decamp
conviction
we're goin' to get ya
conviction
we're gonna burn your hiding place
"you bend it, you shape it, you squeeze and then you rape it"
you just don’t know what you really do
"for money, for power, each minute of the hour"
you just can’t see that your lie shines through
"a legend, a story, a fight for love and glory"
"takes place all the time, according to the news"
"a picture, a photo, a close-up or a total"
you just don’t care if a victim dies on you
"a killer, a rapist, a dangerous escapist"
"you’d rather see the story, than see the justice to be done"
"a boozer, a junkie, a sex-molested monkey"
"i just don’t get it, is something wrong with you?"
"a winner, a sinner, a big expensive dinner"
there is no end to your lack of common sense
"a warzone, a dryzone, got people out of their home"
"a kill, a thrill, you don’t care if you lie"
"you have to sell, to keep your job alive"
"as cold as ice, you don’t care if they cry"
"there’s no remorse, even when they die"
"it’s on the streets, the press is loose"
everytime the day breaks through
the news today will make its way
and somehow find its way to you
"a model, a rock star, the wrecking of a fast car"
you get more famous when you’re dying on the news
"a hijack, a stockcrack, a politician’s sexlack"
"a kill, a thrill, you don’t care if you lie"
"you have to sell, to keep your job alive"
"as cold as ice, you don’t care if they cry"
"there’s no remorse, even when they die"
"it’s on the streets, the press is loose"
everytime the day breaks through
the news today will make its way
and somehow find its way to you
in days of old
when the books were untold
speak of a world crushed by sin.
"""the people will mourn"
"of a war to be born"""
nobody would listen to him.
think back in time
when the future you find
is so faint that it's too hard to see.
don't disavow his word
for the truth must be heard
cause the preacher tells visions he sees.
in 1906
like the future predicts
the city will crumble to the bay
then what's in store
when the worlds go to war?
peace will have come another day
then came the one
in the year of '41
warfare would light up the sky
he beckoned the call
of the future for all
blinded by what's in his eyes
in days of old
when the books were untold
speak of a world crushed by sin.
"""the people will mourn"
"of a war to be born"""
nobody would listen to him.
think back in time
when the future you find
is so faint that it's too hard to see.
don't disavow his word
for the truth must be heard
cause the preacher tells visions he sees.
listen to these words i preach
catastrophic lessons they shall teach
listen to these words i preach
he had an unfamiliar face
complete life in disarray
"a simple man, power drunk"
"no worries of living, no more anything"
deep inside i've seen it rise
actions progress to no end
mirror mirror please look inside
do you see the reasons that we sing
not one to be forgot
"spoled rotten, so they say"
"once burned, forever marked"
hurt by just a few but so many have to pay
pressure coming down
"down on me, gonna break"
broken fingernails
"digging in, scratch my face"
"nervous, like a cat"
gonna jump through my skin
shadows on the wall
"stretching out, grope for me"
"reasons, deep in me"
let me be
let me bleed
set me free
the reasons that we sin
fear the night
you watch the setting sun
the fear hast just begun
all living things now fall asleep
you keep a burning light
try to ignore the night
but you know that it's out there
you try to be prepared
you don't like to be scared
but you know there's no escape
fear the night
don't wanna fall asleep
don't close your eyes again
you'll lose your mind
if you never sleep
you can't stay awake forever
forever
pure evil shows its face
in darkness cold embrace
staring into emptiness
the demons in your head
crawls underneath your bed
you know you have to stay awake
fear the night
don't wanna fall asleep
don't close your eyes again
you'll lose your mind
if you never sleep
you can't stay awake forever
another night has now passed by
you stayed awake and you survived
the day breaks through
but you know it will come back
the night you fear breathes down your neck
don't fall asleep
fear the night
don't wanna fall asleep
don't close your eyes again
you'll lose your mind
if you never sleep
you can't stay awake forever
fear the night
don't wanna fall asleep
don't close your eyes again
you'll lose your mind
if you never sleep
you can't stay awake forever
on!
sailing on!

"sinister plot, not like the rest of the book"
"a bit more in depth, mysteriously at the first look"
i don't why but i prefer chapter 5
"there's something, there's something, there's something so weird..'bout"
chapter 6(66)
"reading is good, living is better"
it says in the book of heavy metal
"you shall not steal, you shall not rape, you shall not kill!"
"there's something, there's something, there's something so sick.. about!"
chapter 6(66)
"from frame to frame, an underlying theme"
"though some, remains the same, just like an evil dream"
"turning a page, enter a new world and a plot"
you think you have solved it but then again not..
chapter 6(66)
"evil souls and blackest hearts, lurking in the night"
"a darkened race, so mean and sly, they keep away from light"
ancient words tell dreadful tales about the other side
about its world where demons live and where the evil hides
they invade the world with war and pain to save their evil aim
"their power's build on blackest lies, but man will pay its price"
"underworld, the centre of the blackest heart"
"underworld, where the evil side hides in the dark"
"they've ruled the world through history, the lords of war and crime"
"military and government, they're brought into line"
"men in black, they cover up the sight of u.f.o.'s"
their power's save as long as there is no one who knows!
they invade the world with war and pain to save their evil aim
"their power's build on blackest lies, but man will pay its price"
"underworld, the centre of the blackest heart"
"underworld, where the evil side hides in the dark"
churches built on holy spots its energy to ban
"exposing truth, who's the church? blackest kind of men"
"religion's made to obscure the mind, living on its lies"
who's the one to wear its crown? the devil! no disguise!
they invade the world with war and pain to save their evil aim
"their power's build on blackest lies, but man will pay its price"
"underworld, the centre of the blackest heart"
"underworld, where the evil side hides in the dark"
"underworld, where laws were made to hide the truth"
"underworld, where evilness and darkness rules"
"you have eyes to see, nevertheless you see nothing!"
"you have a soul to feel, nevertheless you feel nothing!"
"you have a mind to know, nevertheless you know nothing!"
that is the way we want you to be!!! ho ho ho...
here's a song about a little girl

"[music: pell, lyrics: pell/soto]"
silence of the night and a moon that shines
"so bright, scary moments are fading away"
"all life, no real future was in sight"
but i'm on my way
burning fever runnin' through my veins
like screaming horses who will have no chance
in the aquarius dance
breaking of the day and a sun that leads the way
a new horizon's here 2 stay
all 2gether we can see the other side
well i'm on my way
at the primitive times
when the earth was born
generations came and went
lived in ignorance
somewhere in the darkness of time
lies open the ultimate fate of life
"0132 (""mullan rakoseen vaivun"")"
no one can show us the right way
is this enigmatic destiny
this way is going where we are coming from
the time has come...
summer was the season
when he took a ride
women were the reason
and they say whiskey was the slide
living on the action
till it took him down
crawled into his bottle
oh...and let us watch him drown
in skraggy's tomb
yeah skraggy's tomb
sometimes in the evening
before the moon goes down
before the dark is leaving
i could swear
swear i see him
hanging round
so i watch the shadows
and i stop and think
and wade into the shallows
and i have another drink
from skraggy's tomb
welcome to
he was a loaded man going down
always out there screaming at the moon
and every night he'd load another round
from skraggy's tomb
there are certain things we can't explain
we all have our attractions
but then that boy he was insane
skraggy made his life
made his life a crime of passion
talkin' bout
skraggy's tomb
yeah
from skraggy's tomb
"when i hit the ground, i was on the run"
"i was born, the seventh son"
"i came up fast, just wanting more"
always running from the law
"my father said, now slow down son"
life for you has just begun
a little bit of what you fancy always does you good (*)
a little bit of what you fancy always does you good
"don't stop me now, i'm running wild"
i've always been a restless child
i was born to rock and roll
"mmm, it's in my soul"
"i've got my ford, she's long and black"
who needs a fucking cadillac
(repeat *)
i sleep all day and i'm up all night
"i don't get paid, but that's alright"
"don't put me down, i've had enough"
i'll stand and fight
"when i hit the ground, i was on the run"
i was born the seventh son
welcome to where time stands still
no one leaves and no one will
"moon is full, never seems to change"
just labeled mentally deranged
dream the same thing every night
i see our freedom in my sight
"no locked doors, no windows barred"
no things to make my brain seem scarred
sleep my friend and you will see
that dream is my reality
they keep me locked up in this cage
can't they see it's why my brain says rage
"sanitarium, leave me be"
"sanitarium, just leave me alone"
build my fear of what's out there
and cannot breathe the open air
whisper things into my brain
assuring me that i'm insane
they think our heads are in their hands
but violent use brings violent plans
"keep him tied, it makes him well"
"he's getting better, can't you tell?"
no more can they keep us in
"listen, damn it, we will win"
"they see it right, they see it well"
but they think this saves us from our hell
"sanitarium, leave me be"
"sanitarium, just leave me alone"
"sanitarium, just leave me alone"
fear of living on
natives getting restless now
mutiny in the air
got some death to do
mirror stares back hard
"kill, it's such a friendly word"
seems the only way
for reaching out again
you made your choice
i'll take my stand
your life story in my blood stained hands
pride in prejudice
don't give me that power bullshit
pride in prejudice
one gunshot sets the precedence
"abuse of power, civil unrest"
money in blood is of no significance
inner rage waiting to ignite
blood of the innocent unites
i'm right you're wrong
in number i'm strong
violence is proof enough that i am
pride in prejudice
don't give me that power bullshit
pride in prejudice
one gunshot sets the precedence
marshall law as militant state
barrel of a gun seals your fate
fire burns with media hype
speak the truth through your own lies
pride in prejudice
don't give me that power bullshit
pride in prejudice
one gunshot sets the precedence
pride in prejudice
don't give me that power bullshit
pride in prejudice
one gunshot killed the innocent
some love to hate
right in your face
violence will facilitate
fuel the fire with racial slurs
and see who kills the other first
scream at nights
but you won't be heard
it's deep inside
the pain within your head
you cry for help
the torture won't let you go
your mind is aching
and you can't go on
reaching for window
your execution
the only solution
night screamer
afraid at nights
there's nothing to be afraid of
your nightmares
won't leave you alone
try and think hard
what's wrong in your life
try and stay cool
you'll find peace of mind
reaching for...
i have a dream no more such pain from dictators
no more such racists and no hell on earth
no politicians are tellin´ us lies any more
life without enemies life without war without war
some people are starving while some of us stay rich
some pigs are the masters that pull all the strings
faster we fall if we won´t change at all
pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
faster we fall free your mind free your soul
stronger than ever before
i have a dream no more commanders and soldiers
life without enemies life without war
no killing weapons no walkin´ on blood any more
some people are starving while some of us stay rich
ooh some pigs are the bastards left the poor all as slaves
faster we fall if we won´t change at all
pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
faster we fall free your mind free your soul
stronger than ever before stronger than ever before
faster we fall if we won´t change at all
pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
faster we fall free your mind free your soul
stronger than ever before
faster we fall if we won´t change at all
pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
faster we fall free your mind free your soul
stronger than ever before stronger than ever before
stronger than ever be stronger than ever be
stronger than ever before

"no, never thought it was simply fantasy,"
you gotta put all your faith in me.
"come, sit down : listen to what i got to say,"
that's not a story the one i'll tell...
and in this night i will tell you of my travel
that brought my mind to the holy gates of heaven
"lost, close in mystical thoughts of life and death,"
some strange reflections of a different place...
and so my spirit began a holy flight
to where i'd look at my ancient lives...
"and here a light, cleansing as a holy fire"
gave me the right to proceed along with pride
"wonder of time, miracle of life,"
all here is pure as the light !
"deep in my heart, calling to me,"
angels are calling my name !
"no, never felt any peace like that before..."
all of my troubles were dead and gone.
and every night i still hope to fly away
to where my spirit has been (again)
will i be back ? every night i praise an angel :
"""please take me there, i wanna stay with you"
"forever..."""
"wonder of time, miracle of life,"
all here is pure as the light !
"deep in my heart, calling to me,"
angels are calling my name !
will i be back ? every night i praise an angel :

i see now... i see through the veil of expectation.
i see now... i see that conformity is betrayal.
"betrayal of those who are forgotten, yet vision alone furthers our blame."
"unless followed by transformation, it is pointless to be given sight."
"without the hope of our reaction, we overlook the purpose of our eyes."
"now is our chance to breathe without tyranny, released from the blinding of false light."
(blinding of false light) now is our chance to breathe without tyranny.
in weakness we are freed...
i see now... i see that conformity is betrayal.
"with empty eyes i looked ahead (ahead), with clarity i now look back..."
"now is our chance to breathe without tyranny, released from the blinding of false light"
(blinding of false light). now is our chance (our chance) to breathe without... without tyranny.
in weakness we are freed... yeah...
i admit my failure. opacity has dulled my senses.
conformity (conformity) controlled by lifeless vices. oh... yeah...
covetousness (covetousness) disguised as ambition.
but now it ends... but now it ends... but now it ends...
"but now it ends, not with defeat but determination... we are freed.... yeah..."
"now is our chance to breathe without tyranny,"
released from the blinding of false (false) light (light).
now is our chance... now is...our chance... in weakness we are freed...
i sense the darkness
the desire overtakes
my devotion endeavours
habitation changing course
repentance oh not
no shame or remorse
will i ever authorize
on this treasured path
i am warm by this fire
and it's flaming desire
for what i cannot fulfil
my destiny completes
i believe my truth to be
a much greater thing
than a manufactured lie
too great to comprehend
where i come from
there's no higher authority but me
being my own god
is all i was meant to be
antichristus spiritualis
antichristus spiritualis
antichristus spiritualis
antichristus spiritualis
in sorte diaboli
time has had it's way with me.
my broken tired hands can`t build a
thing.
the wires that have held me still
embedded now in flesh to find my will.
"the idle of my days is won,"
"the empty i have fed has made me numb,"
despite what you will find in me.
the failures of my past just swirl beneath.
i need a heart that carries on through the pain
when the walls start collapsing again
"give me a soul that never ceases to follow,"
despite the infection within
our careless feet leaving trails
neverminding the fragile dirt we all end in.
our careless feet leaving trails
neverminding the fragile dirt we all end in.
this is where i find my fall
the cares that held me alive don`t work at all.
and every step away from here is closer to the plague
i hold so dear.
"i need a heart that carries on through the pain,"
when the walls start collapsing again
give me a soul that never ceases to follow
despite the infection within
our careless feet leaving trails
neverminding the fragile dirt we all end in.
our careless feet leaving trails
neverminding the fragile dirt we all end in.
awaiting my end
breathing in the day that finds me new.
redemption begins bleeding out the flaws
in place of you.
awaiting my end
breathing in the day that finds me new.
redemption begins
redemption begins.
our careless feet leaving trails
neverminding the fragile dirt we all end in.
our careless feet leaving trails
neverminding the fragile dirt we all end in.

marching over the mist
leaving behind the wheack's
going this endless war
like a tormenting nightmare
over the devastate ruins
i raised a sign
the sign of hate
for a masses despair
to revenged the years
arrested in abyss
where jesus christ
made his suffer
but the final command
is happening here now
which i see is the ruins
and warriors marching to death.
"arrogance, violence, world in disarray"
dealing with insanity every fuckin' day
"i hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin' scene"
"pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity"
"ain't got the time, i don't want anything from you"
feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin' do
"no looking back, no regrets, no apologies"
what you get is what you see
"live fast, on high"
"repentless, let it ride"
my songs relive the atrocities of war
can't take society any fuckin' more
"intensity, anarchy, hatred amplified"
playing this shit is all that keeps me alive
i leave it all on the road living on the stage
this is my life where i kill it everyday
"so take you shot, bottom's up, this is no lie"
i'll be beating this guitar 'til the day i die
"live fast, on high"
"repentless, let it ride"
"i hate the life, hate the fame, hate fuckin' scene"
"pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity"
"ain't got the time, i don't want anything from you"
feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin' do
"no looking back, no regrets, no apologies"
what you get is what you see
we're all killing ourselves a little more everyday
"live fast, on high"
"repentless, let it ride"
once again i find myself alone
here in the north lands
"hope has gone, i stare at my blank walls"
i do what i can
"vittu perkele saatana, our house was filled with laughter"
we drank the vodka every night
"times have changed, i long for my home town"
before the sadness
lost and cold the factories now closed down
engulfing madness
"ei saatana vittujen vittu, dreaming of 2002"
we were at our favourite bar every night
face the endless trials of all our days
but now we go our separate ways
it's not too late to make a change
for all the wasted time
find the path reclaim your tragic youth
we're forced to face the twisted truth
the light still shining for a while
for all the wasted time
life was good but now just let me go
keep my last pay check
northern sun still shines upon on the snow
i placed my last bet
closing time on a tragic story
when i'm gone you won't be sorry
someone please just take me far away
"the long winter nights, the long summer days"
remember the good times far away
but nothing to live for nothing to say
seize the day outside the world is wide
we still have one chance left tonight
the choice is ours to make it right
for all the wasted time
it's hard to say
that i'm back
on a straight line
you see my path
"is in fact, just a fall line"
"it's in my blood, it's in my lungs"
and it won't die
"i fight these words, i bite my tongue, so i don't lie."
though it's me to blame
"there is no more shame in me, in me..."
i just feel the same
immune to all this pain
& the scars don't write a song for me at all
"im am a stone, unaffected"
rain hell down onto me
"flesh and bone, unaffected"
your foll i will not be
"im am a stone, unaffected"
rain hell down onto me
"flesh and bone, unaffected"
your foll i will not be
i try to see & believe
in the short side
accept the burn of a vein
and a half life
and how you rest your faith in these.
for a lifetime
that hallow lie agains my hope
that i won't buy
though it's me to blame
"there is no more shame in me, in me..."
i just feel the same
immune to all you say
and the scars don't write a song for me at all
no your tears won't light a path for me to crawl
"im am a stone, unaffected"
rain hell down onto me
"flesh and bone, unaffected"
your foll i will not be
"im am a stone, unaffected"
rain hell down onto me
"flesh and bone, unaffected"
your foll i will not be
the waters rise above my eyes
i will breathe it and go out with the tide
and when you think this is the end
you will find me there where i have always been
"(im am a stone, unaffected"
rain hell down onto me
"flesh and bone, unaffected"
your foll i will not be
"im am a stone, unaffected"
rain hell down onto me
"flesh & bone, unaffected"
your foll i will not be
"im am a stone, unaffected"
rain hell down onto me
"flesh & bone, unaffected"
your foll i will not be
i am a stone...
i am a stone.

"takers of humanity, elders paranoid"
"the time is now, give up this world you once destroyed"
"society versus the underground, their battles fought and lost"
the time has come to rule the world at any cost
for the past it's too late
'cause the world can't control fate
shadows cast loud and clear
tell the world the new order's here
"cities turn to battlefields, a deadly spell is cast"
corpses falling one by one until the last
the preacher speaks of prophecy so many years before
no one escapes their punishment - the gods of war
for the past it's too late
'cause the world can't control fate
shadows cast loud and clear
tell the world the new order's here
"death is like an empty space, fell no thoughts of fear"
the future cries as mother nature sheds a tear
"the world becomes a prisoner, a victim of its crime"
the human race is now a race against time
for the past it's too late
'cause the world can't control fate
shadows cast loud and clear
tell the world the new order's here

how come every time you feel real good
somebody drops you a piss off bomb
how come every time you roll the dice
somebody offers you the wrong advise
"oh no not again, just when i'm feeling happy"
"oh no not again, just when you're feeling fine"
"take it slow, don't go fast"
looking good never lasts
different day same old song
then somebody drops you a piss off bomb
"in and out, round about, try to sort your feelings out"
can you see the full moon rising
"break the spell, ring the bell, trapped inside your private hell"
can't you see the far horizon
"down, down, drag you down, just when you're feeling happy"
"down, down, drag you down, just when you're feeling fine"
"take it slow, don't go fast"
looking good never lasts
different day same old song
then somebody drops you a piss off bomb
how come every time you feel real good
somebody drops you a piss off bomb
how come every time you roll the dice
somebody offers you the wrong advise
"round, round, turn you round, just when you're feeling happy"
"down, down, drag you down, just when you're feeling fine"
"take it slow, don't go fast"
looking good never lasts
different day same old song
then somebody drops you a piss off bomb
i was feeling the love
rising from the dark
getting ready to see
more than meet the eyes
feel the fire within your heart
but the light has a price
when you come to life
you are what you left behind
not what you are inside
i am feeling the tears
running down my face
like a dream i once had
from another place
sometimes the pain makes you whole
time will heal you
no matter if your lies make
you go through the night
feel the brand new me
hear the brand new me
nothing lasts forever
not a tear or smile
a life without some living
is like living a lie
sometimes the pain makes you whole
time will heal you
sometimes the world makes you crawl
just to bring back the pride
show your colors
and die with your boots on
but don't live a lie
feel the brand new me
hear the brand new me
nothing lasts forever
not a tear or a smile
a life without some living oh no
bring the toys out for the boys
let the children make their noise
see the monsters in their metal cages
turn the lights down in your soul
cut the power to your heart
see the carcass in its dying rages
machine men - cannibals of rust
machine men - iron bites the dust
machine men - build with feet of clay
i’m coming to sweep you all away
what bitter vampire made you this
gave you life with its badly kiss
ground you limbs to bloody stew
made a new machine of you
turn the nightmare into day
"suck your breath, take your life away"
beating harder trough your veins
someone else’s cold remains
machine men - cannibals of rust
machine men - iron bites the dust
machine men - build with feet of clay
i’m coming to sweep you all away
they’re coming to sweep you all away
machine men - cannibals of rust
machine men - iron bites the dust
machine men - build with feet of clay
i’m coming to take you all away
machine men - cannibals of rust
machine men - iron bites the dust
machine men - build with feet of clay
i’m coming to take you all away
they’re coming to sweep you all away

i'm born into this world of
joy and misery
where all the things go round in circles
the sense of life it seems to be
an unknown mystery
with ups and downs
the good and the bad things
"living, loving"
weeping and mourning
finally the circle's closing in
the circle of life
"another chance, another try"
the circle of life
as moments passing by
the circle of life
"another love, another lie"
the circle of life
will we end in paradise
what will come and what will be
noone can foresee
future gives the answers to all questions
some may choose a simple life
some decide to die
some are always searching for the reasons
"living, loving"
weeping and mourning
finally the final curtain falls
time to spread my wings and learn to fly
i try to leave it all behind
time to enter up the stage of life
the whole world is mine
i will take the train to anywhere
go through heaven and through hell
i will make my way and i don't care
if i win or fail
there wouldn't be good without the evil
no wisdom without stupid people
would there be fear if we could be immortal?
welcome to the opposition portal
don't we all hate the adjustment we make
suffering for your great fucking state
is to compromise for a safe life a mistake?
musical destruction is our outbreak
metal discharge
payback to all those losers the armies of black will disctate
metal discharge
all those years of torment in a society that i do hate
metal discharge
payback to all those losers the armies of black will disctate
metal discharge
the opposition against all odds
"unbreakable, longhaired, noise loving squads"
the non conform metal power station
grows slowly throught nation and nation and nation
metal discharge
payback to all those losers the armies of black will disctate
metal discharge
all those years of torment in a society that i do hate
metal discharge
payback to all those losers the armies of black will disctate
metal discharge
once greeted smiles
cause of outrageous lifestyles
our breed will resist all fake trends
until this sad world ends
call it culture of the brainsick
our press ignored music
this cultural essence of noise
keeps us watchful not to turn into toys
there wouldn't be good without the evil
no wisdom without stupid people
would there be fear if we could be immortal?
welcome to the opposition portal

deathbent
warped mind
tripped out
out of time
body count rise again
sick and hellbent
broke and twisted
the end isn't far behind
black mass reverends
black mass reverends
hate machine
destroy all you seek
kill and rape
trample the weak
never ending stream of fear
sick and hellbent
for the end is near
black mass reverends
black mass reverends
smashing the human horde
crushing religious filth
nailing invertedly the ones who plant the seeds
of doubt
wasting inherent truth
confronting an inner hell
cursing subconsciously the ones who reap the
seeds of doubt
how can humans play god when they are all
slaves?
their lack of souls will lead them to an early
grave
condemned to live a life of unrelenting praise
their rotted corpse remains when death replaces life
tearing the vocal chords of prophets that spoke of lies
unwanted
they are the ones controlling the seeds of doubt
how can humans play god when all they are are
slaves?
their lack of souls will lead them to an early
grave
condemned to live a life of unrelenting praise
their rotted corpse remains when death replaces life
fearing their fate they chose a random date
when all life would cease and rapture would
release
trampling the meek the gospel they did speak
foretelling demise speaking only lies
[solo: jack]
feeding the senseless souls of mindless
inhabitants not knowing they are the ones
consuming the seeds of doubt
finding the source of stimulation unnurtured
realization of fools who will always against their
will just end their lives
how can humans play god when all they are are
slaves?
their lack of souls will lead them to an early
grave
condemned to live a life of unrelenting praise
their rotted corpse remains when death replaces life
i'm gonna take you
to a place far from here
no one will see us
watch the pain as it disappears
no time for anger
no time for despair
won't you come with me
there's room for us there
this innocent beauty
my words can't describe
this rebirth to purity
brings a sullen tear right to your eyes
no time for anger
no time for despair
please let me take you
'cause i'm already there
i'm so alone
my head's my home
i'll return to serenity
rhyme without reason
is why children cry
they see through the system
that's breeding them just so they die
so please let me take you
and i'll show you the truth
inside my reality
we shared in my youth
i'm so alone
my head's my home
and i feel
so alone
you know
at last
i return to serenity
now that i've taken you
to a place far from here
i really must go back
close your eyes and we'll disappear
won't you come with me
salvation we'll share
inside of my head now
there's room for us there
as i clear my mind enough to see
decaying pieces of my being that have fallen on me
i find the one clean cut that has given the wrath
beneath the deep and cleansing fire that is shaping the path
i've had all my life to fall in place
i watch all my past in right decay
and with every step that shames my face
i see all my pieces catch ablaze
"the pain is fading, now you're leaving me alone."
"i can't stop bleeding, i'm depleting on my own"
i can't bury every form i've seen
the hollow pieces of perfection are embedded in me
and with every step the walls give way
and in the shadow of deceit i can see you fade
i've seen all those dreams we try to hide
and the sound of honesty's reply
but i'm not that man you've seen inside
he was born so pure but then he died
with every word i breathe out
i feel it escaping from my soul
with every thought created
omission leaving me so cold
i've seen inside the downward fall
remember all the filth i saw
i've seen inside the downward fall
remember everything i saw
bloodshot eyes and a dead beat stance
shit for brains i'm a game of chance
one cut two cut counting scars
three cut horns up behind the bars
i'm not your patron saint
i'm not your patron saint
horns up or down horns up i am your warpaint
you're not my angel dear
you're not my angel dear
let's make this crystal clear
horns up i am your worst fear
it's not the cough that carries me off
it's the motherfucking coffin they carry me off in
it's not the cough that carries me off
it's the coffin they carry you off in
i'm not your patron saint
i'm not your patron saint
horns up or down horns up i am your warpaint
you're not my angel dear
you're not my angel dear
let's make this crystal clear
horns up i am your worst fear
one shot ten shot just in case
's what it takes to get you out of my face
"if i wake up strapped up in my bed, you can slit my wrists"
i'd rather be dead

descendant from adversity
a youth learns early what hatred means
enraged with anger no dignity
"whitewashed the mind, no knowledge of self"
"beat everyone till there's, no one else to beat"
"stand in line your next to, grovel at my feet"
"i will be the one, i want to be"
"make no mistake, what's my name"
stand against the foe
is a sweeter death to know
a battle for our right
is a sweeter death to know
better to stay and fight
is a sweeter death to know
stand against the foe
is a sweeter death to know
won't kill in foreign lands
return and beat by racist hands
we're victims of an oppressive game
he cast aside a life of fame
the weight is heavy
the burden great
stand to be different
held onto faith
a defiant champ of the world
but never stood alone
felt the fire beneath his feet but kept pushing
on despite of the heat
didn't matter at all
what people might said
he had the sprit to fight
his way to the end
even in the sickness there's a torch with a flame
"lighting up a path, for all those who came"
even in the darkness there's a glimmer of hope
never down and never out the original goat
"""uh, we got a killstreak coming up if anyone's interested. """
it's getting late at night by a freezing moon
the time is running out and the end is soon
an army in despair - don't know what to do
impure thoughts are raging in this empty room
the victims are escaping now we shall regroup
the times are getting tougher as we face our doom
a circus of horrors waiting just for you
the barrel's bottom anything will do
so take my hand and i will lead you right into
"extraction zone, the zone, you can make yourself at home"
"extraction zone, your zone, you don't have to feel alone"
where dreams become reality and standards
will now cease to be
so live your life in the extraction zone!
another place another time we carry on
not getting any easier cos we're getting on
a creature from another world it's gone all wrong
a circus of horrors waiting just for you
the barrel's bottom anything will do
so take my hand and i will lead you right into
"extraction zone, the zone, you can make yourself at home"
"extraction zone, your zone, you don't have to feel alone"
where dreams become reality
and standards will now cease to be
so live your life in the extraction zone!
as a new dawn will rise
i promise myself not again
but deep in my heart
the fire still burn just the same
still the same
a circus of horrors waiting just for you
the barrel's bottom anything will do
so take my hand and i will lead you right into
"extraction zone, the zone, you can make yourself at home"
"extraction zone, your zone, you don't have to feel alone"
where dreams become reality and standards
will now cease to be
so live your life in the extraction zone!
climbing
heights unimagined unattained
to drop bodies from the sky
falling
alive in mid air moving fast
heads exploind on the ground
throwing
corrupted souls in front of trains
just to watch the bodies fly
grinning
at the site of shredded innards
brains exploded all around
high velocity impact spatter
slamming
you into walls excessive speed
creates catastrophic sounds
scraping
fresh blood and guts from off the pavement
before strench of death sets in
piercing
between the eyes and unexpected
liquid red spraying behind
killing
impact spatter brutal force
something i will always need
high velocity impact spatter
a necro potion is made
from the remains of the dead
daily ritual intake
drinking remains of the dead
death after life after death
only obtained in one way
high velocity impact spatter
all the hate in this world i adore
thousands of legions
with black heart core
riding high are my horsemen of four
nothings safe -
no one cares -- that's a fact
hell - unholy kingdom ruled by war
hell - pain and fury is the law
hell - fire and brimstone i desire
hell - satan on his throne of fire
there's no love
for the priestess of hate
babylon nests
in her kingdom and war's
evil sanctuary screams and gyrates
living hell -- lake of fire -- infernal
on the night that
the black angel fell
i opened the gate
for an entrance to hell
when he saw his
new kingdom to dwell
set alight -- in the fire - of his rage
longer
inside me
the doe is rising
to clench us to kill
lusting
you`re nothing but you know me
stand against your will
to satisfy me
bit by victim
stealth is me...
sature me
say all the right things
just come with me
(let`s go for a ride)
"trust me, don't leave me, don't be so deceiving, god help me"
"betray me, the bloodlust and beating"
just wanna play
just wanna play
a new game
the hunter is in me
the doe is searching
dash for the kill
abducted
take away
search for the patience
of 1000 men
peel my eyes
lock on target
the covert man
(you never had a chance)
don't be alarmed
want some candy?
just ride over here
(now get inside)
a new...
i just wanna play
(just wanna play)
i just wanna play a game
a new game
you meant everythin to me
(you know your time has come)
another broken dawn today
(you know your time has come)
[x2]
i just wanna play
(i just wanna play)
i just wanna play a game
(just want to play a game)
one that you've never played before
(never before)
one that you'll never play again
i'm sure
[x5 (1st time has no backing)]
"weigh anchor, hoist the sails"
cruisin' for booty on watery trails
no exploiter we see can still sail on
our cannons fire till his ship goes down
"fly our flag, we teach them fear"
"capture them, the end is near"
firing guns they shell burn
surrender or fight there's no return
under jolly roger
"venerable scoundrels, no blood on our hands"
"our engagement are tough, but only for defence"
carefully we sail around the reefs
to force those die-hards to their knees
"fly our flag, we teach them fear"
"capture them, the end is near"
firing guns they shell burn
surrender or fight there's no return
under jolly roger
coming through the waves to free all the captives
boarding the vessels we know all the tactics
"we're the menace, the curse of the sea"
we pulverize the men'o'war pay or flee
"fly our flag, we teach them fear"
"capture them, the end is near"
firing guns they shell burn
surrender or fight there's no return
under jolly roger
we killed a lot of innocent civilians.
to us every civilian in baghdad was a terrorist.
with them in civilian clothes that makes everybody
"free game,"
but if they came within our perimeter
we lit them up and when we would pull the body out
and search the car we would find nothing.
this took place time and time again.
no harm no foul.
"its okay, don't worry about it."
this is a new type of war.
this is an eradication.
[long instrumental]
i honestly feel that we are committing genocide over
here.
i don't believe in killing civilians
and i am not going to kill civilians
for the united states marine corps.
there's nothing special about it
it's either there when you're born or not
gifted with talent are no big deal
welcome to the death of a century...
cause yesterday don't mean shit
what's over is over and nothing between
yesterday don't mean shit
because tomorrow's the day you have to face
there's no rewinding time
yesterday don't mean shit
yesterday don't mean shit
reliving old reviews is a useless tool of confusion
don't hold your breath for the turn-around
come into the world of endless odds...
(mid)
they'll tell you about guilt
and in time you'll face the darkness...
but darkness is a friend to you
embrace and fly through the madness
flying past god and wars and conflict
oppressor in you (x2)
plowing through minds and paranoia
oppressor in you
the oppressor's in you
(solo)
yesterday don't mean jack shit...
to protect you and i'll keep to myself
smile pretty for the devil - children of bodom

"[music - p. o'brien, lyrics - p. mazurkiewicz]"
memory of the insane
"of killing in so man ways, homicidal"
seeking redemption through rage
with hacksaws i decapitated them all
"blood covers the groud, my feet are saturated"
"rotting flesh scattered around, i feel no remorse"
i don't remember my name
or when blood of the dead flowed so relentlessly
extracting the brains from the skulls
my anger evolves with the more heads i deform
sawing the neck i am engulfed in fantasy
"chew the esophagus, cannibal delicacy"
"utterly execerbated, forver deleterious"
"slicing through skin, sundered larynx, veins spraying blood"
"tattered windpipe, facial carvings, another head to abhore <?>"
beheading sustains my desire
enhancing my primitive mind
annihilation without repreving
[solo - o'brien]
memory of the insane
"of killing in so man ways, homicidal"
seeking redemption through rage
with hacksaws i decapitated them at will
"predacious, violent killing spree"
"abolished, putrescent cadavers"
"butchered in excrement, sordid obscurity"
feverish hunger to inhale the stench of their death
i can’t play god forgiveness is hard
forgiving also as tough i have my orders
blood’s thicker than water
though much harder to clean up
lol in on it lol in on it never forget
some stupid tomorrow some stupid today
some stupid tomorrow go away go away
yesterday
handful of rain
the night is growing dark
from somewhere deep within
it shelters like an ark
that always takes you in
the barmaid walks on over
and pours another round
for a lost soul at the corner
who prays he¹s never found
and the mind goes numb
until it¹s feeling no pain
and the soul cries out
for a handful of rain
wash your women
in your whiskey
when your future¹s
in the past
and your staring
up at heaven
from the bottom
of a glass
and you need some insulation
from the years you¹ve
had and lost
and you feel the perspiration
as you¹re adding up the cost
and the night rolls on
like a slow moving train
and the soul cries out
there¹s a land beyond the living
there¹s a land beyond the dead
if it¹s true that god¹s forgiving
of the lives that we had led
in the distance there¹s a thunder
and the air is thick and warm
and the patrons watch with wonder
the approaching of the storm
and the night rolls on
like a slow moving train
and the soul cries out
for a handful of rain
there¹s an old man in the corner
and he¹s smoking all the time
an the smoke is drifting upward and it¹s
twisting in my
twisting in my
mind
in my mind
the whiskey¹s getting deeper
and i use it like a moat
there¹s a blues man in the distance and he¹s
lost inside his
note
his note
the night is growing dark
from somewhere deep within
it shelters like an ark
that always takes you in
and the night rolls on
like a slow moving train
and the soul cries out
for an handful of rain
virgin little schoolgirls
dirty little nurse
"teachers, whores and chambermaids"
all lifting up their skirts
sister's in the bathroom
getting nice and clean
telescopic vision
he's bursting at the seams
"posion pleasures, taken by hand"
"rapid fire, from his pulsating gland"
neighbours at the window
trying her new bra
young and horny lovers
back seat daddys car
searching through his bondage
cindy's in top drawer
"blondes, brunettes and redheads"
to satisfy the voyeur
"uncut videos, vibrating eye"
"snakes alive, cause he's never shy"
he's the voyeur
leggy traffic wardens
women of the law
coming hard on oral
she's begging him for more
polaroid mistress
versatile and lean
fingering her naked flesh
fuel for his wet dreams
he's had them all
thats what he says
the liar
so little action
but nobody cares
about the voyeur
you meet some strange people in this place...
voyeur
do not doubt her wisdom
don't resist her call
just follow in her footsteps
for she will not wait
she bears her treasure
carries it before her footsteps
be ever alert
for she will not wait
the keeper of fleeting moment
she's the golden elk
the mother of time and tide
the shaper of destinies
the keeper of fleeting moment
she's the golden elk
the mother of time and tide
do not hesitate then
don't resist her call
be ever alert
for she will not wait
the queen of time
gives you the direction
predicts your path
the one that you must follow
the queen of time
the keeper of fleeting moment
she's the golden elk
the mother of time and tide
the shaper of destinies
the keeper of fleeting moment
she's the golden elk
the mother of time and tide
if you see her as a ghost in
winter's blizzard
sense her in the shy sunset of spring
hear her as a rustle in summer's night
see through her autumn wood's disguise
the keeper of fleeting moment
she's the golden elk
the mother of time and tide
the shaper of destinies
the keeper of fleeting moment
she's the golden elk
the mother of time and tide
the shaper of destinies
if you thought you heard her voice
if you think you saw her shape
the queen of time
if the wind brought you her scent
if you tracked her on your trail
the queen of time
murderer - covered in sangre
murderer - blood on your shoulders
karma - how does it feel?
karma - to take a life
wailin*- wailin* in vein
wailin* - you*ll reap what you sow!!
thou shalt not kill
thou shalt not kill
thou shalt not kill
thou shalt not kill
lie to yourself - lie to your friends
now lay and wait you fucking
rapist - you*ll have no redemption
burn - burn - burn muthafuckas
*i might just come after you
i just might come after... but you*ll never know...
broke the first commandment*
thou shalt not kill
thou shalt not kill
thou shalt not kill
thou... face your judgement
a snowy owl above the haunted waters
poet of ancient gods
cries to tell the neverending story
prophecy of becoming floods
an aura of mystery surrounds her
the lady in brightest white
soon the incarnate shall be born
the creator of the night
deep dark is his majesty's kingdom
a portent of tomorrow's world
there shall the liquid give him power
the red-eyed unborn lord
fatal embrace of the bloodred waters
the cradle of infinite gloom
the spell to master this earth
carven on an infant's tomb
"""i will die for the love of the mermaid"
her seduction beauty and scorn
welcome to the end of your life
"- hail the oceanborn!"""
"""disgraced is my virginity"
death has woven my wedding dress
oh great blue breathe the morning dew
"for you are the cradle of the image of god"""
"""brave now long rest is sweet"
"with me here in the deep"""
"""i prayed for pleasure wished for love"
"prayed for your - """
"""never pray for me!"""
"""who the hell are you for me"
"but a mortal dream to see?"""
"""this apathetic life must drown"
"forever just for me"""
"""leave me be"
leave me be
"leave me be...ee...eeee"""
"""from cradle to coffin"
"shall my wickedness be your passion"""
we shall come to set the dolphins free
we shall wash the darkened bloodred sea
our songs will echo over the mountains and seas
the eternity will begin once again in peace
throw your hands in the air
let's start this shit
we are the name of the game
putting filth on the map
the right side of the reason
the wrong side of the tracks
it's not the fame or the game
we crawled out of the dirt
because i still can't fill my pockets
with my name on your shirt
"yeah we play, scream"
and get up off our knees
"inside, we're taking back the night"
"generation lost, we don't sleep at night"
we don't give up
"generation lost, clench your fist"
and punch your eye out
"generation lost, want you to think"
that we've had enough
"generation lost, we don't"
think what's in the sky
we are the beacon of hope
the dark side of the light
we always aim for the float
we only come out at night
if you do mollies you
should see my correction
you're sharing copies but
you're lacking impression
"yeah we play, scream"
and get up off our knees
"we ignite to excite, throw"
your hands in the air and scream
"generation lost, we don't sleep"
"at night, we don't give up"
"generation lost, clench your fist"
and punch your eye out
"generation lost, want you to think"
that we've had enough
"generation lost, we don't"
think what's in the sky
holding up to save yourself
and terrorize like no one else will
and screaming out some way out done
we'll live forever in the emptiness
coast to coast i hear the masses calling
turn up now this is your final warning
throw your hands in the air
let's start this shit
"generation lost, we don't"
"sleep at night, we don't give up"
"generation lost, clench your fist"
and punch your eye out
"generation lost, want you to think"
that we've had enough
"generation lost, we don't think"
what's in the sky
eternities ago i must have fallen
through my pride been perfect in my ways
the morning star he'd fired down from heaven
envy wrapped into a gown of grace
i hear the screams that echo from the darkness
i swerve from dawn to dusk came off the edge
oh hear the creature crying in the distance
buried in the symbol on a shelf
i'll take you home tonight
to center of your soul
i'll take you home tonight
"fire, flesh and blood"
touching the flames tonight
touching the flames tonight
morning star embrace me on these grounds
angel of light
how will i forgive him
who wouldn't forgive
me who just valued the power
how shall i live in peace with the one
outshining me and then have me devoured
i'm feeling alive under these skies
bloodshot's the moon and scarlet's the night
i'll make you fume in fury and rage
i'll make you see what you made of tonight
i'll take you home tonight
to center of your soul
i'll take you home tonight
"fire, flesh and blood"
touching the flames tonight
touching the flames tonight
touching the flames tonight
touching the flames tonight
we can laugh at it now
i dont mind all the burning daggers
"piercing me, shaping me"
turning the blade on you
i revealed my escape
"sweetest mutiny, ship was sinking"
deeper and deeper and deeper
on top of you
"oh, how does it feel?"
now when there's no way out
you married your own hell
couldn't get out of your own mind
now i have the key
out of the downwards spiralling conspiracy
just look at me
just look at
"diva, diva, diva, diva"
when you chiselled your scene
"so delusional, almost got me"
started to question my sanity 'cos of you
i've been tasting the salt
couldn't stand all the rats on board
i walked down the plank as the curtains fell down
on you
"oh, how does it feel?"
now when there's no way out
you married your own hell
couldn't get out of your own mind
now i have the key
out of the downwards spiralling conspiracy
just look at me
just look at
"diva, diva"
"diva, diva"
see the curtains hangin' in the window
in the evening on a friday night
a little light-a-shinin' through the window
lets me know everything's all right
summer breeze makes me feel fine
blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
see the paper layin' on the sidewalk
a little music from the house next door
so i walk on up to the door step
through the screen and across the floor
sweet days of summer - the jasmine's in bloom
july dressed up and playing her tune
and i come home from a hard day's work
and you're waitin' there
not a care in the world
see the smile awaitin in the kitchen
food cookin' and the plates for two
feel the arms that reach out to hold me
in the evening when the day is through
in the morning your try to recover
but you still got the red in your eyes
then you get up and look at the mirror
and you see the beast arise
got a big red nose from the overdose
and somebody else's eyes
and you think to thee is it really me
and you have to realize
the prize that you pay for a moment like this
is never for high 'cause you still doing it
don't you know that we all stand in line
our future dreams are just a waste of time
our future -is a madhouse
and we all are movin' in
cause the world - needs some action
and there nothing left to gain
"take your baggy, things are ready"
you only need to come
join this century's schizoid clan
the rooms are primed and done
the price that you pay
for a moment like this
is never too high
'cause it perfectly fits
don't you that we are wasting time
insanity is just a state of mind
our world - is a madhouse
"in the gutter, come on in"
our world - needs some action
satisfaction 'til the end
our world - we need sex and crime
to supply our minds
"an amazing time, come on in"
our future - and we party on
'til our life is done
just to waste our time - 'til the end
my decision is fixed
the suitcases are packed
i‘m laying the letter on the table
"tonight, i will be safe and the fears will be over"
i shall outline my own way again!
"i’m walking to the door,"
open it and look behind for the last time...
"...but he’s at the doorstep, this can’t be real"
"he’s surprised because he notices my bags,"
immediately he grabs my wrists and pushes me inside
i realise i’m lost...
"o no, what have you done,"
what have you done where is your self respect?
you’ve defiled our honour and your throth
you crossed the line
"you won’t get out this time,"
you won’t get out there’s no other solution
then requite you for this insult
"...but he’s at the doorstep, this can’t be real"
"he’s surprised because he notices my bags,"
immediately he grabs my wrists and pushes me inside
while he’s reading the letter i realise i’m lost...
"faded beauty, her body trembles..."
the scars of this dream will always be remembered
everyone that you love is dead
unholy ghost of crane's delirium!
trace the fear of your silhouetteyou wanted madness
undead ahead!
oh how the wind it whispers
the moonlit fog ignites!
with lucifer as witness
the pumpkin rides tonight!

welcome to the other side
there's no place where you can hide
where demons rule with endless power
there you will spend your last hour
unfortunately you are not in heaven
and your sins are unforgiven
you sold your soul and lived a lie
don't ask me why you have to die
step into the fire
you bloody liar
follow your obsession
get your funeral procession
follow your obsession
watch your funeral procession
welcome to the other side
where shadows live without pride
the fruit of poison takes control
and the mortals take it's toll
blood stops running through your veins
and the death takes away your pain
on a bed of roses you're lying there
motionless with this evil stare
step into the fire
you bloody liar
follow your obsession
get your funeral procession
follow your obsession
watch your funeral procession
the enemies inside your head
now they're gone or now they're dead
they're put your body to lie in state
and now you know this is your fate
step into the fire
you bloody liar
follow your obsession
get your funeral procession
follow your obsession
watch your funeral procession
down on main street the scene was set
they check out the fuel turn the radio on
"open the gates, assemble the gun"
"wait at the red, for the president's run"
the world was shocked that fateful day (*)
"a young man's live was blown away, away"
"in dallas 1 p.m., 1 p.m."
right and left in the back of the head
"screaming confusion, shots rip the air"
"cadillac racing, cops on the run"
they couldn't believe the president's hit
the shooting stunned as i seemed to run
"is he dead, no-one will say"
around the world the news was flashed
we sat and watched your tragic history
(repeat *)
the world was shocked
in dallas 1 p.m.
we sat and watched
tragic history
the world was shocked
ten thousand years ago in mesopotamia
a new type of thinking was developed
one that involved
totalitarian agriculture
and now
good bye blue sky
good bye blue sky

we're falling asleep as people
as animals on this planet
"(good bye, blue sky, good bye, blue sky good bye)"
we are here to nurture our planet
"(good bye, blue sky, good bye, blue sky good bye)"
we are here
to help guard this fuckin' place not destoy it

i always knew i had what it took
to jump over any obstacle
together or separate we've been through
fight for me and i'd kill for you
i always knew things were the same
but there's a caution light in your brain
i won't help with your cement shoes
if bailing out is what you choose
you've been spending years and years
carrying your biggest fears
"too long, too long"
you've been sucked in through a hole
with your vision of control
"so wrong, so wrong"
if you leave your defenses down
who will chew you up and spit you out
if you leave your defenses down
who will pick you up
poison my eyes
better men have tried
tried to take me down
a man is a man is a
man you can't see clear
now your forced to hear
all that you dread
better to keep it hidden
believing it's what you deserve
you make me feel everything i do
betters me and sabotages you
but all it does is leave you behind
as you disconnect from the grind
drowning in your own denial
is as simple as a smile
one is strong one insecure
who dies first in our private war
you've been wasting years and years
running from your darkest fears
"too long, too long"
you've been falling through the holes
now your vision of control
"is gone, is gone"
if you leave your defenses down
who will chew you up and spit you out
if you leave your defenses down
who will pick you up
poison my eyes
better men have tried
tried to take me down
a man is a man is a
man you can't see clear
now your forced to hear
all that you dread
better to keep it hidden
believing it's what you deserve

forever i remain the hideous figure treading these unholy grounds

and with my tongue i shall lick the graves of all who will follow me

due to the legend a new king will come
rise in the morning horizon
brave and believing
for wars to be won
born with the heart of a lion
he will fight for a country unite
till the last drop of blood confines the oath
till all will respect him wherever he roams
deep in the wood
she can hear she's alive
lost in the dark of a dragons lament
searching the highlands
in trying to find
trace of morgana
the princess of hate
he will be holding
the sword in the stone
knights of the kingdom will join him
bring back the honor
of pendragons name
from where the cauldron is boiling
but the shadow of uther restrains
all the efforts to reunite the realm
a witch of his own blood from heaven expelled
deep in the woods there are prints in the sand
leading towards
where the angels repent
king of the ocean
king of the land
nothing can save him
from merlin's consent
coming of storms
battles of war
knights of thunder are fearless
thus goes the legend
the tale i was told
now we await his appearance
but the shadow of uther remains
there is no way the king can break the oath
the shadow will follow wherever he roams
(russell)

don't touch her cold skin or you slowly will die
don't be fooled by her friendly smile
don't you follow her treacherous voice
that leads the fools into her arms

she won't let your heart grow old
the hunter's night will last forever

that leads the fools into her arms

"fight for survival, fighting for your life"
we're fighting for the reptiles
"freedom of speech, freedom of lies"
they show us what we want to see
it happens all the time
"does it mater what the people say, hey"
"does it matter to you, who"
"does it mater what the people say, hey"
what do the people want to do
like the poison running through your veins
you're addicted to the pain and the shame
chasing the same game every day
hooked on all your bullshit and your vanity
"blind decisions, no regrets"
a bittersweet of toxic sweat
"take my pride, taken chances all my life"
"never answers, but in time"
"you just wait, you're gonna say my name"
"break this bind, cut my losses"
"no more carrying all your crosses, 'cause in time"
"you just wait, you're gonna say my name"
"oh, you're gonna say my name"
a normal situation in disguise
dragging me through your self-inflicted lies
too bad you're never gonna win this game
your misery's your only friend and you're to blame
"blind decisions, no regrets"
a bittersweet of toxic sweat
"take my pride, taken chances all my life"
"never answers, but in time"
"you just wait, you're gonna say my name"
"break this bind, cut my losses"
"no more carrying all your crosses, 'cause in time"
"you just wait, you're gonna say my name"
"oh, you're gonna say my name"
"bringing everybody down, down, down and turn it around"
"into the same game, twisting it upside down"
"another go around, you're gonna say my name"
it's gonna come around yeah!
"bringing everybody down, down, down and turn it around"
"into the same game, twisting it upside down"
"another go around, you're gonna say my name"
"you're gonna say my name, say my name"
"take my pride, taken chances all my life"
"never answers, but in time"
"you just wait, you're gonna say my name"
"break this bind, cut my losses"
"no more carrying all your crosses, 'cause in time"
"you just wait, you're gonna say my name"
"oh, bitch! say my name"
you know you're gonna say my name
"oh, say my name"
no more tears
i'm out of fears
i'm out of pain
i'm out in the rain
it will gently wash away
the light of the day
i'm in love with the darkness of the night
i'm in love with all that's out of sight
i'm in love with the magic of the new
"and the darkness loves me, too"
finally
it covers me
it makes me taste
it's sure embrace
it will gently take away
the sorrows of the day
"come out, come out whenever you are"
"don't hide, don't hide near or far"
don't hide
"sacrifice, holy rites, secrecy and alter wine"
"black candles burning low, to the meetings again they go"
picard can't wait to take away another soul
"oh it's a shame, picard was so insane"
"in the year of 1642, it came to an end"
"in 1642, imprisonment"
"sacrifice, holy rites, secrecy and alter wine"
"black death come this way, father picard will soon be going"
"he's ill, so sick, now his meetings are forever over"
"oh it's a shame, they went along with his game"
"in the year of 1642, it came to an end"
"in 1642, imprisonment"
"sacrifice, holy rites, secrecy and alter wine"
the nuns can't take the blame
one after one they suffer a breakdown
"confession, confession, they confess to diabolic possession"
"oh it's shame, even madeleine has gone insane"
in my darkest hour
a place where there's no light
i'm trapped here in this nightmare
and there's no end in sight
my body lies here frozen
no voice to scream or shout
escaping feels untouchable
i know i must get out
wake my
wake myself from all this danger
claw my
claw myself from six feet under
"no, no, no"
am i stuck here like a prisoner of war?
i will breathe once more
i will breathe once more
these feeling's overwhelming
it just won't go away
i'm captive in this nightmare
and this is where i'll stay
wake my
wake myself from all this danger
claw my
claw myself from six feet under
"no, no, no"
am i stuck here like a prisoner of war
i will breathe once more
i will breathe once more
my anxiety is rising
it just won't go away
all this tension keeps building
"please, just leave me to die!"
"make, make, make it go away"
all i wanna do is live another day
"make, make, make it go away"
all i wanna do is live another day
(live another day)
wake my
wake myself from all this danger
claw my
claw myself from six feet under
"no, no, no"
am i stuck here like a prisoner of war
i will breathe once more
breathe once more
i see ya lookin’ at me
from across the room
with your backstage pass
from a roadie you blow
girl you act so cool
you like to play it shy
but you can’t fool me
you got the wild sex vibe
"yeah, you want it!"
"yeah, you want it!"
"yeah, you want it!"
"yeah, you want it!"
we want it too!
dd time
you go to all the shows
when they cum to town
all the girls know your face
they say you been around
you went from l.a. guns
to enuff z’nuff
and then you partied with poison
on the bak of their bus
dd time
your mother thinks we’re rude
and tipper says we’re trash
but as far as i’m concerned
you can kiss my ass
so come on baby
you ain’t no yuppie
do the right thing
and bust those puppies
"almighty asmodeus, existant of chaos"
ominous be thy name
thy kingdom come on earth
lead me into all temptation of my flesh
so i may trespass greatly into
thy ways by my desires
for thou art all sex-seeking unity
thou mighty genitalia of creation
that knoweth no satiation
grant thou my wish
i remember it as plain as day
although it happened in the dark of the night
i was strolling through the streets of paris
and it was cold it was starting to rain
and then i heard a piercing scream
and i rushed to the scene of the crime
but all i found was the butchered remains
of two girls lay side by side
murders in the rue morgue
someone call the gendarmes
murders in the rue morgue
run before the killers go free
there's some people coming down the street
at last there's someone heard my call
i can't understand why they're pointing at me
i never done nothing at all
but i must have got some blood on my hands
because everyone's shouting at me
i can't speak french so i couldn't explain
and like a fool i started running away
murders in the rue morgue
someone call the gendarmes
murders in the rue morgue
am i ever gonna be free
and now i've gotta get away from the arms of the law
all france is looking for me
i've gotta find my way across the border for sure
down the south to italy
murders in the rue morgue
someone call the gendarmes
murders in the rue morgue
i'm never going home
well i made it to the border at last
but i can't erase the scene from my mind
"anytime somebody stares at me, well"
i just start running blind
well i'm moving through the shadows at night
away from the staring eyes
any day they'll be looking for me
'cause i know i show the signs of
murders in the rue morgue
running from the gendarmes
murders in the rue morgue
running from the arms of the law
murders in the rue morgue
running from the gendarmes
murders in the rue morgue
am i ever gonna be free
it took so long and i'm getting so tired
i'm running out of places to hide
should i return to the scene of the crime
where the two young victims died
if i could go to somebody for help
it'd get me out of trouble for sure
but i know that it's on my mind
that my doctor said i've done it before
murders in the rue morgue
they're never gonna find me
murders in the rue morgue
i'm never going home
"storm-lord, the dreaded one"
poison of our worlds
"in times of darkness, of death and decay"
he grasps dominion all over
his stench hovers as shame
in the house of fraticide
an impressive depravity of a cadaverous epiphany
a profane blasphemy of the darkest atrocity
"welcome me, mortal beings"
to a world a cry of fear
incursions to evil
shattered are your dreams
"my breath, a torrid wind"
of immortal pestilence
"heaves torment, pain and anguish"
suffer in your silence
"chaos, no salvation"
"misery, no redemption"
twisted minds hold the key
"benevolence, i pray for thee"
"drowned in fear, shrouded in black"
mourning eternally in a spiritual lethargy
every beat of his heart
is a death-toll chiming in a mind
as chimes grow stronger
the earth shudders in his wake
his final lament is a
requiem to the gods of darkness
all deep contempt is a
blasphemous sacrilege to his name
i was laid around bored to tears watching flowers grow
i got my car and drove to town tried to find a show
"cruised around for an hour or two, hunted high and low"
i had to find some rock 'n' roll to make my system go
"'cos i can't, i can't stop rockin' (*)"
let me hear that music one more time
"'cos i can't, i can't stop rockin'"
i found a club with a neon sign on the sleazy side of town
a battered jukebox on the wall was the only source of sound
a drunken sailor from a russian whaler was my only drinking mate
"then through the door smashed a hundred more, said yeah let's celebrate"
(repeat *)
the party burst straight out through the doors out onto the street
people came from miles around dancing to the beat
"from across the street came a real smart suit, said hey i'm gonna sue"
"but there ain't no sucker with a long legged hooker, gonna tell me what to do"
drones since the dawn of time
compelled to live your sheltered lives
not once has anyone ever seen
such a rise in pure hypocrisy
i'll instigate i'll free your mind
i'll show you what i've known all this time
"god hates us all, god hates us all"
you know it's true god hates this place
you know it's true he hates this race
homicide - suicide
"hate heals, you should try it sometime"
strive for peace with acts of war
the beauty of death we all adore
i have no faith distracting me
i know why your prayers will never be answered
god hates us all; god hates us all
he fuckin' hates me
"pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark"
global chaos feeding on hysteria
"cut throat, slit your wrist,"
shoot you in the back fair game
"drug abuse, self abuse searching for the next high"
sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
i'm waiting for the day the whole world fuckin' dies
i never said i wanted to be god's disciple
i'll never be the one to blindly follow
man made virus infecting the world
self-destruct human time bomb
what if there is no god
would you think the fuckin' same
wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
wake the fuck up can't ignore what i say
i got my own philosophy
i hate everyone equally
you can't tear that out of me
no segregation - seperation
just me in my world of enemies
i never said i wanted to be god's disciple
i'll never be the one to blindly follow
i'll never be the one to bear the cross - disciple
i reject this fuckin' race
i despise this fuckin' place
mired in illusion
lost in the masters game
silenced by the idea of time
nurtured with lies and deceit
"the silent seeker, the seer"
travels beyond the veil
"the silent seeker, the seer"
fleeing the dense womb of ignorance
to the trained eye
there are no coincidences
the more you see
the less it makes sense
to the trained eye
there are no coincidences
if you can not see
you can not truly know
we are the current sum of all the ages
leaving a trail of burnt pages
thrown into darkness as stars
we travel alone as one
when the dust settles on the tavern
is when we're liberated from illusion
taking our first and final breath
realizing life is always after death
mired in illusion
lost in the masters game
silenced by the idea of time
"time, time, time..."
to the trained eye
there are no coincidences
the more you see
the less it makes sense
to the trained eye
there are no coincidences
if you can not see
you can not truly know
"the silent seeker, the seer"
travels beyond the veil
"the silent seeker, the seer"
fleeing the dense womb of ignorance
there comes a time
a man’s gotta draw the line
when push comes to shove
i’m always a step behind
rattlesnake sister
you’re a voodoo child
i’ve been sleepin’ with the devil
and i don’t know why
here comes the time
this man’s gonna draw the line
you put a target on my heart
go ahead

whoa oh i’m gonna
beat the bullet
you can’t shoot me down

ready aim fire
c’mon and blow me away!
caught in a game
where love never had a chance
you cut the cards
and i held the losin’ hand
you put a target on my heart
go ahead
take your best shot
whoa on i’m gonna
you put a target on my heart
"but girl, you’ll never get"
that far
whoa oh i’m gonna
beat the bullet

"demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings"
racing to the battle in the sky ancient gods are
"calling me i hear them when they sing, of all the"
heroes who wait for me to die
"beneath a cloak of magic, i'll meet them in the air, i am"
"invisible, i move without a sound they look but cannot"
"find me, they think that i'm not there with a spell i"
send them crashing to the ground
"wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky"
by fire and magic i am sworn. hell is calling! we
cannot be denied fly to the bllackness
"of the storm, we must die to reborn"
"i wear a sacred talisman, i make a secret sign"
"now welcome me into this wicked wind, on"
the journey of a shaman a dragon i must
"ride, the gates of hell are open! let me in!!!"
rule of hell or serve in heaven
"choose an altar or a throne, all"
commandments and the laws of
man disown. now eat the fruit of
"knowledge, unto no one ye alone"
"into the fire, with your soul!"
hey man
we're only one
one dream
one heart
one blood
we've grown
we had to leave
behind the fears and childhood
'cause there was only one
only one way to carry on
when life stole our loved ones
that's the trail
where we found our creed
brotherhood
oh!
hand in hand
down the fields of war
we will stand together
as only one
honoring our memories
brotherhood
hey man
almighty one
you made us steel and gold
"don't think, despite the thorns"
we'll give up
we knew the truth
'cause there was only one
only one way to carry on
when life stole our loved ones
that's the trail
where we found our creed
brotherhood
oh!
hand in hand
down the fields of war
we will stand together
as only one
honoring our memories
brotherhood
brotherhood!
an unknown belief
fills our dreams if what i say
"to be sings from another world, another land"
there was always only one
only one way to carry on
when life stole our loved ones
that's the trail
where we found our creed
brotherhood
oh!
hand in hand
down the fields of war
we will stand together
as only one
honoring our memories
brotherhood
brotherhood!
woah! woah!
brotherhood!
brotherhood!
the brotherhood!
"the signs are here, the end is near"
a lot to think about
"walk through the door, that will be all"
we're closing down
"come on and let us go, all hope is gone"
"life is a feast, all you can eat"
every night and day
"our job is done, we brought you joy"
every now and then
inside the wheel another turn
around the sun
"pick up the bill, it's time to go"
we're leaving town
"move on and let us go, all hope is lost"
"our job is done, we brought you joy"
every now and then
"buy the time, oh! clear the space"
it's all or nothing
it's now or never
life is a game you cannot win
you just have to play
"our job is done, we brought you joy"
every now and then
"buy the time, oh! clear the space"
it's all or nothing
it's now or never
red arises in the sky of sunday morning
washing the face of the mountain by the sea
"i am the present without knowledge, without warning"
the child in me will never cease to be
"is not the future we see, endless daze of fantasies"
the ocean whispering me time really doesn't exist
"now i'm drifting away, imprisoned by our memories"
love was just a word until you gave it meaning
go on and find the prince of crime
temptation keeps you satisfied
distort your sight i suffocate
in your silent masquerade
leave me as victim of your lies
salvation cannot help you hide
won't hear me cry i suffocate
in your silent masquerade
no one can tell the games that we play will last forever
"no matter we tried, we never got a chance"
go on and find the prince of crime
temptation keeps you satisfied
distort your sight i suffocate
in your silent masquerade
leave me as victim of your lies
salvation cannot help you hide
won't hear me cry i suffocate
in your silent masquerade
go on and find the prince of crime
temptation keeps you satisfied
distort your sight i suffocate
in your silent masquerade
leave me as victim of your lies
salvation cannot help you hide
won't hear me cry i suffocate
in your silent masquerade
slowly fading
burnt like fire in a pyre
life will disappear with you
and now
all i hear is silence
somehow
all i wish for faded in the dark
i burn with you
we''ll see it through
i burn in you
it will never be the same as it was before
it's true
we'll see it through
i burn in you
but we'll never be the same as we were before
and now
feel the heat around me
see the blaze that burns me
all of this is tearing me apart
i burn with you
we'll see it through
i burn in you
it will never be the same as it was before
it's true
we'll see it through
i burn in you
but we'll never be the same as we were before
burning the pyre
take me in your arms
and start to burn
yearning for life
take me in your arms
and start to burn
i burn with you
we'll see it through
i burn in you
it will never be the same as it was before
it's true
we'll see it through
i burn in you
but we'll never be the same as we were before
time has imprisoned on my soul
religion in the path of what compels me
lies instrument the holy hate
deceiving of the weak in faith intention
suffering with no reason and nodoubt
pertruding on the lines of persecution
vomit on the holy man never before your saviour
brain dead victims of the holy
preach your holy lies
laugh at divinations and we all will be dead
inscripted is you who will die
hypocratic bible puncher
perish from thisland
faithinized victims of the kingdom of hatred
infecting this world with their plan
before none i shall confess
from a far nor heaven sent
cursed are the lambs of god
brain dead victims of the holy
preach your holy lies
laugh at divinations and we all will be dead
inscripted is you who will die
hypocratic bible puncher
perish from thisland
faithinized victims of the kingdom of hatred
infecting this world with their plan
time has imprisoned on my soul
religion in the path of what compels me
lies instrument the holy hate
deceiving of the weak in faith intention
suffering with no reason and no doubt
pertruding on the lines of persecution
vomit on the holy man never before your saviour

"mister sandman, bring me a dream."
make her the cutest that i've ever seen.
give her two lips like roses of clover.
then tell her that her lonesome nights are over.
"sandman, i'm so alone."
don't have nobody to call my own.
please turn on your magic beam.
"mister sandman, bring me a dream."
"mister sandman, bring me a dream."
make her the cutest that i've ever seen.
give her the word that i'm not a roamer.
then tell her that her lonesome nights are over.
"sandman, i'm so alone."
don't have nobody to call my own.
please turn on your magic beam.
"mister sandman, bring me a dream."
"mister sandman, bring us a dream."
give her a pair of eyes with a congeal of gleam.
give her a lonely heart like harlehatschi.
and not so wavy hair like liberatchi.
"mister sandman, someone to hold."
would be so peachy before we're to old.
so please turn on your magic beam.
"mister sandman, bring us,"
"please, please, please,"
"mister sandman, bring us a dream."
yeah...
[music & lyrics: p. wagner]
my blinded eyes are staring at the burning sky
there's not a cloud to throw a shadow in my way
my dried out body's got no shelter from the sun
"what's coming over me, to hell, what's coming over me?"
i'm stumbling through these fields of naked stones and sand
"here's nothing growing, every life has found and end"
and not a drop of water that could wet my lips
"what's coming over me, to hell, what's coming over me?"
i'm burning for liquid
more than words can say
i can't stay in this wasteland
"i'm starving, i need your hand"
"take me to the water, bring me to a shore"
"take me to the water, i can't take much more"
i can't explain it what has happened to my land
what once were meadows now is deadly desert sand
"and all my people died, our fountains, they ran dry"
"what did come over us, to hell, what did come over us?"
"we were a race of billions, trying to rule the earth"
but on this planet we have done our job the worst
it seems that our evolution made no sense
"what did come over us, to hell, what did come over us?"
"disasters, they warned us"
we did not see the signs
i can't stay in this wasteland
"i'm starving, i need your hand"
"take me to the water, bring me to a shore"
"take me to the water, i can't take much more"
"we were send to a holy land, were meant to understand"
pride got us completely wrong to believe we're endless strong
"take on life and i'll take two, sort 'em out and kill anew"
"hell is here, it's sad but true"
when one thinks he's more than you
the blinded eyes are staring at the burning sky
"the last man on this planet, left alone to die"
the only hope is left to find what he was told
to find the river where the water of mercy flows
i was born in a cave of a mountain
i couldn't hear they were calling my name
"all they said ""it's the curse of the haunted"""
i couldn't see that they're burned down in flames
run away from the gates of thunder
escaping from the scary dream
"holy knights, the seven wonders"
(will) help me through this mystery
looking back there's a light in the darkness
shining through the hole in the sky
the walls came down at the wizard's crown
"oh i wish, i wish i could fly"
locked again in a mountain
"dancing through the fire, ice and snow"
"oooh, it's the time of the truth"
don't wanna hurt you
the liar and the fool
"oooh, it's the time of the truth"
don't wanna hurt you
the liar and the fool
woooh...
"the grinder and the fallen angel,"
the hangman's work was left undone
the gates of life are closed forever
searching for the midnight sun
sailing through a sea of shadows
riding on the edge of time
the hands of doom are searching for you
"and you wish, you wish you could fly"
dreams are turning into nightmares
and heaven turned to hell
"oooh, it's the time of the truth"
don't wanna hurt you
the liar and the fool
"oooh, it's the time of the truth"
don't wanna hurt you
the liar and the fool
woooh...
"oooh, it's the time of the truth"
(the time of the truth)
don't wanna hurt you
the liar and the fool
"oooh, it's the time of the truth"
(the time of the truth)
don't wanna hurt you
the liar and the fool
"oooh, i don't wanna play <i>[...]"
don't wanna hurt you
the liar and the fool
"oooh, it's the time of the truth"
(the time of the truth)
"i don't wanna hurt you, no"
it's the time of the truth
(the time of the truth)
i don't wanna hurt you
i don't wanna play <i>[...]
"yeeah, yeeah"
it's the time of the truth
the time of the truth
(the time of the truth)
the tides of change pulled us apart
i feel a familiar pain
it seems like years since we've loved
or even liked and that's a lonely way to be
drifting alone in a sea of agony
your face i can't recognize
don't make this hard on us
i will miss you if you just go away
i did no right you did no wrong
nothing left but wasted days
i regret you leaving
but i will never take you back
(you know what? it's over
i just don't feel the same way as i used to
"we've been together forever, but it's over)"
goodbye 1000 times goodbye
the thought never crossed my mind
that this would be my last goodbye
let me put pennies on your eyes
and kiss your lips one last goodbye
my love 1000 times goodbye
it seems nothing good is free
a good thing cost much more than the price
you were good but not that good
don't kid yourself now it's time to break up
drifting alone in a sea of agony
your face i can't recognize
don't make this hard on us
i will miss you if you just go away
i did no right you did no wrong
nothing left but wasted days
i regret you leaving
but i'll never take you back
(don't call me anymore. it's just not...
i don't feel the same way about you
its not as good as it used to be)
goodbye 1000 times goodbye
the thought never crossed my mind
that this would be my last goodbye
let me put pennies on your eyes
and kiss your lips one last goodbye
my love 1000 times goodbye
(i'll always love you but just not like that)
(like what?)
(i want to be honest with you i met someone else)
(you did what?)
"(and i really, i really love him like i used to love you"
remember the time that i told you that
i was going out of town for business?
well i went to see him)
(you know what? you suck!)
goodbye 1000 times
(you'll always have a special place
in my heart you know that
it's just i can't be with you anymore it's over)
goodbye 1000 times
(things may not work out with him)
goodbye 1000 times
(and if they don't)
goodbye 1000 times
(then i'll certainly call you)
goodbye 1000 times
(you mean a lot to me
i still really want to be friends with you
i love you like you're my brother)
i hate you for the sacrifices you make for me
i hate you for every time you ever bled for me
i hate you for the way you smile when you look at me
i hate you for never taking control of me
i hate you for always saving me from myself
i hate you for always choosing me and not someone else
i hate you for always pulling me back from the edge
i hate you for every kind word you ever said!
"blood, blood, blood!"
pour mud through my veins
"such a dirty, dirty mouth"
i'm not that easy
"blood, blood, blood!"
pour mud through my veins
"i'm a dirty, dirty girl"
i wanna feel saved
"blood, blood, blood!"
pour mud through my veins
"such a dirty, dirty mouth"
i'm not that easy
"blood, blood, blood!"
pour mud through my veins
"i'm a dirty, dirty girl"
i wanna feel saved
i love you for everything you ever took for me
i love the way you dominate and you violate me
i love you for every time you gave up on me
i love you for the way you look when you lie to me
i love you for never believing what i say
i love you for never once giving me my way
i love you for never delivering me from pain
i love you for always driving me insane!
"blood, blood, blood!"
pour mud through my veins
"such a dirty, dirty mouth"
i'm not that easy
"blood, blood, blood!"
pour mud through my veins
"i'm a dirty, dirty girl"
i wanna feel saved
"blood, blood, blood!"
pour mud through my veins
"such a dirty, dirty mouth"
i'm not that easy
"blood, blood, blood!"
pour mud through my veins
"i'm a dirty, dirty girl"
i wanna feel saved
"i hate you, i hate you!"
"blood, blood, blood!"
pour mud through my veins
"such a dirty, dirty mouth"
i'm not that easy
"blood, blood, blood!"
pour mud through my veins
"i'm a dirty, dirty girl"
i wanna feel saved
"blood, blood, blood!"
pour mud through my veins
"such a dirty, dirty mouth"
i'm not that easy
"blood, blood, blood!"
pour mud through my veins
"i'm a dirty, dirty girl"
i wanna feel saved
i hate you for every time you ever bled for me
endless
my war to reason
falling to pieces
when i could see
now i don't understand
empty
my fears of treason
trying to blind me
the brightest void is sucking me in
like a million geysers still asleep
demons in you
lost in the light
eternal seek for paradise
scared to lose the fight with what's in me
found another side
the darkest thoughts
the deepest sea
where sun and moon arise
it's me
chaos and isolation
your only truth
what we can hear no one can understand
madness
in desperation
a burst of anger
the shadow self is taking over
like a million geysers still asleep
demons in you
lost in the light
eternal seek for paradise
scared to lose the fight with what's in me
found another side
the darkest thoughts
the deepest sea
where sun and moon arise
it's me
lost in the light
eternal seek for paradise
scared to lose the fight with what's in me
found another side
the darkest thoughts
the deepest sea
where sun and moon arise
it's me
fighting the odds while we still have time
there is a limit don't cross that line
it's no good with water we cannot drink
we're a ship about to sink.
we pray but the wall is just too high
we pay with our lives to the dark tower in the sky.
c'est la vie life in the shadows
c'est la vie there's no tomorrow
give us back the blue blue sky
where the air is so fresh were eagles fly
what good is a planet that's slowly dying
what kind of life can it bring.
we pray but the wall is just too high
we pay with our lives to the dark tower in the sky.
c'est la vie life in the shadows
c'est la vie there's no tomorrow.
i was going nowhere stuck in this place
no ones really moving i can't stand the pace
i look to left of me i look to the right
there's nothing here around me no exit in sight
i was going nowhere nowhere fast
someones got to help me
i'm going nowhere fast
chaos on the highway i'ts a parking lot
i can't see the problem we sit here and rot
there blocked to the front of me there blocked to the rear
i've got a hundred things to do instead of sitting right here
no signal on the mobile i talk to myself
i think i'm going crazy i've got to get some help
i look to left of me i look to the right
there's nothing here around me no exit in sight
(...)
i don't like such stupid people
with their (...)
i don't like your worthless friends
with the talk about their problems
"with a can of small talk, they'll feel good"
but they are fools
i don't like to sit beside you
in your brand new car
i don't like to show you need
every day and night
you come into my life like someone
"being a star, but you are no more"
after a few days with you
i was glad to be alone again
glad - so glad - so glad - alone
glad - so glad - so glad - alone
if you have to work for nothing
(...) a day
tears and sweat i had in future
not much more to live
you come into my life like someone
"being a star, but you are no more"
after a few days with you
i was glad to be alone again
glad - so glad - so glad - alone
glad - so glad - so glad - alone
moving sideways through the sold photo
slow figures flashing on tiptoe
crashing cars on a blue tableau
goes to show it wasn't everywhere
"no one steering, just an auto-move"
round and round the streetlights in the groove
"flying windscreens, dropping down below"
"aisles of bricks, crumbling with the smoke"
here we go
dissolving turnpikes in a placid light
intersections similarly white
i never found the concrete slab
i must have left it on the showroom tab
escalators moving side to side
round and round the footprints on the slide
"from a picture, the city turned and spoke"
"there she was, the woman in the smoke"
here we go
i think you suit me
i'll make you happy
you specify me
you can't deny me
must have left my eyes on a moving train
tangled phone lines told me to revoke
"turgid reasons, everything's mundane"
"there she was, the woman in the smoke"
here we go
i guess you suit me
do you extend me?
you maximise me
you can't deny me
i think you suit me
i'll make you happy
music: lynch
"lyrics: dokken, pilson, brown, lynch"
the shootin's over
the smoke is clear
another notch in my gun
another round of ammunition
before the damage is done
she wanted this
i gave her that
she said she will
i took good aim
she felt no pain
when i started moving in for the kill
cuz i've got bullets
bullets to spare
i've got bullets- bullets to spare
my barrel's ready
my hand is steady
tonight i'm ready for fun
i got my finger
it's on the trigger
another night on the run
she wanted this
i gave her that
she said she will
i took good aim
she felt no pain
when i started moving in for the kill
cuz i've got bullets
bullets to spare
i've got bullets- bullets to spare
we will not return to the countless mistakes of the past
i will not relive the failures of the man i once was
only through dedication will i destroy all preconception
no longer will i let myself be truly satisfied with the standard
we will not return to the countless mistakes of the past
only through dedication will i destroy all preconception
let this be
be the day
day of my
my declaration
let this be the day of my declaration
"join me,"
walk with me
shatter the bonds that tie us
to what we strive to never be
"join me,"
walk with me
"deaf, blind"
it's getting hard to breathe
dark dreams become reality
cold creeps - underneath my skin
screams in the night
the walls are closing in
"maybe i'm condemned,"
but time will tell
soon i'm standing
at the gates of hell
save me from myself
take away the pain
catch me when i fall
hear my call - a life in vain
i need someone
to save me from myself
"lost, out of reach"
wounds will never heal
crawl in the dust
feel the way i feel
"maybe i'm condemned,"
but time will tell
soon i'm standing
at the gates of hell
save me from myself
take away the pain
catch me when i fall
hear my call - a life in vain
i need someone
to save me from myself
i'm at the dark side of life
in the shadows where no one belongs
and i try to find my way back
"but i'm lost, lost without hope..."
feeling out of place
something must be wrong
emotions in my space
tight grip holding on
i can't control the events around me
i can't console the stress inside me
and once i turn off my brain
i realize i am a lie
i want you to see
i'm trying to please
everyone around me
i'm down on my knees
the stress makes me flee
it feels like they're all stabbing me
feeling out of place
why must i hold on?
anger i can taste
tight-lipped self is gone
i can't control the events around me
i can't console the stress inside me
and once i turn off my brain
i realize i am a lie
i want you to see
i'm trying to please
everyone around me
i'm down on my knees
the stress makes me flee
it feels like they're all stabbing me
what the fuck do you want from me?
i am just a human being
living my life to please everyone
i can't do this anymore
being everybody's whore
being everybody's whore
being everybody's whore
being everybody's whore
for once...
i'm gonna stand up
and face me!
i want you to see
i'm trying to please
everyone around me
i'm down on my knees
the stress makes me flee
it feels like they're all stabbing me
being everybody's whore
being everybody's whore
being everybody's whore
being everybody's whore
brunobrn
i don't owe anything
i don't owe anyone
shoot pride for all its worth
i don't belong
in a situation now
that i could not repair
i assert myself to sleep
show others that i've cared
how cold is this poor life
lay ashes at my grave
if it takes me away from you
a subtle gesture
i don't know anyone (cherish my religion)
i don't know anyone (faith is only fiction)
i don't know anyone (cherish my religion)
i don't know anyone (faith is only fiction)
this is erased i promise not a trace
i'll play your game
but if you lose you're gonna have to pay the price
"broken chains, like a prisoner free at last"
the fear inside just up and died
time will tell if i am wrong
it won't be too long
you thing i'm chasing shadows
in the dark
well i'm not born to lose
i'm not born to lose
"you curse my name, as you turn and walk away, from view"
it won't be too long
you don't scare me cos you're
hard to see and it's time
that you were gone
it won't be too long
you think i'm chasing shadows
in the dark
well i'm not born to lose
you think i'm chasing shadows
in the dark
what you gonna do about it now
what you gonna do about it now
it won't be too long
it won't be too long
it won't be too long
you think i'm chasing shadows
in the dark
what you gonna do about it now
what you gonna do about it now
ain't nothing i can do about it now
"intenacious, intersecting"
reaving fats from corporal griskin
culled...for sodden gelatine brayed
"skeletal groats triturated, desinently"
"exsiccated, sere glutenate brewed"
for frivolous solvent abuse...
derogate coarse remains
for glue to dry
despoiled marrow razed
...a truculent shambles so severe...
extravated bone - as adhesive incarnate
a pellucid quietus - nocuosly i create
"corporal glue, breathe in the fumes"
"mucilage vapours, toxic fumes to savour"
comminuted remains
as gum to dry
a lissom gel so glazed
...a truculent shambolic affair...
the exsanguine esprit - shorted as snuff
rheumic oils forever - bonded together as gum
"human glue, choke on the fumes"
"noxious vapours, slaughterous labour..."
"help me, i can't put it away"
and you can't make me so i disobey
"help me, this thing is feeding"
hopeless and fucking beaten
i tried all along (help me please)
it did things to me (it's not real)
had to take prestige (it's not me)
i can't feel a thing (suffering)
i feel sympathy
my hurt on display
and i see it boilling up
so hard to disobey
hold me
it's coming i can't see
hopeless and fucking beaten
hopeless and fucking beaten
i tried all along (help me please)
it did things to me (it's not real)
had to take prestigе (it's not me)
i can't feel a thing (suffering)
i can't remеmber a thing
you had me strung up by a string
"oh, the things i wish i said to make"
a better version be allowed to sing
and nothing beats the heartbreak left behind
and nothing soothes the hurting only time
nothing only time
nothing only time
nothing only time
beats me up inside
hopeless and fucking beaten
hopeless and fucking beaten
i tried all along (help me please)
it did things to me (it's not real)
had to take prestige (it's not me)
i can't feel a thing (suffering)
you give them hell
straight to the chin
if you can't win
their hearts and minds
on the first try
up and say aye!
aye!
they'll listen
fires are raging and the sirens scream
and your pathetic life has run out of road
if you were offered eternity
would it slip through your fingers to wicked to hold?
rebel
backslider
reach higher
you give them hell
you give them
hell this ain't no warning
you give'em hell because you must
it's a long hard road we're walking
because this battle chose us
"this battle chose us, this battle chose us"
a gang of blood
and by killing so distilling
a simple plan
never settle our true mettle
yeah!

godless
feeling in me
night
after night
godless
feeling in me
borne
of their lies
you gave me all of this
and more
"yea, that's for sure"
i can't believe in all your pain
under the draining of a
christian
delities blood
you tell your children they're insane
i couldn't love it anymore
and so you leave me
godless
just spread your tentacles
of hate
around my life
i've taken more than you could ever give
you can't believe that someone
challenges
your right
i'm gonna send you back your pain
i couldn't love it anymore
i had to listen to my heart
i couldn't take it anymore
and so you leave me
godless
"i ask all who have gathered here, to join me"
in this feast. may we always be strong in body
spirit
and mind
and all those who would try to harm us
"the time is close now, the end is near"
"my walk through the valley, trails of fear"
"i feel empty, my penance overdue, i guess it's too late now"
to be with you
i'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
"i sold myself, the death of me"
i know you can't forgive me
"i know i'm on my own, i've betrayed you"
i walk alone
what exactly is the meaning of this
just pawns in your twisted game
severe pain for the lie i'm livin'
for a love i never could betray
question me not say the lord unto thee
you have chosen your own fate and your own destiny
denied of this life is what you are to be
you have chosen your own fate and your own destiny
lord i pound my fists at you
won't you just let me die
would i not suffer enough
no inner peace no after life
i did what i thought was right
all for the love of my life
i know it's sad but true
something is very wrong
condemned to suffer so long
for a love so true
the question that lies within
is so hard to understand
it still tears at me
and in my dying breath
my heart holds no regrets
i wouldn't change a thing
my spirit begins to rise into the heavenly skies
just to be shunned away by you
"now all i want is to die, no streets of gold in the sky"
and i wash my hands of you
rising to the heavens light
just to plea for death
just to be denied-
(i know you can’t forgive me
i know i’m on my own
i know i’ve betrayed you
you know i walk alone
i want trails of fear
i pound my fists at you
i shunned away by you
i wash my hands of you
i won’t to let me die...)
rising to the heavens light
just to plea for death
just to be denied
"fall, fall, fall black shroud, veil of ignorance"
it is a new light we desire
"fall, fall, fall gods of man, worn masks"
that our new empire may at last rise up
"fight, fight, fight the fear of freedom, you cannot lose"
"fragile are the steps, sharp is the rise"
"courage, our time has come"
"courage, the time is now"
souls of steel no one owns us
"murderers of oppression, chosen race"
just choose to be chosen
"father, give us today what is needed"
"give it all, father"
thy will be done on earth
and in the skies for ours is the kingdom
nightwish - final dream
lower your head down
and sleep in my shoulder
lower your head down
and start a new dream
"and for tonight, the moment is over"
drifting in a lullaby
here where the stars reside
and the angels are always seen
lower your head down
the stars they have whispered
hear what they say
and know what mean
the moon is your guide
the stars they have kissed
as she goes them kindly by
lights as of a baby side
saves on fairy tales dream
and start a new dream...
"holy one unsung, you are the scum of his philosophy"
will you ever learn that it is god who is the enemy?
step across our line from the divine and twisted beaten path
spewing forth in bullshit to your final fatal bleeding gasp
what you have to say about your lord don't mean a thing to me
bash you fucking head in with the book of his insanitiy

ram your religion so far up your ass

blasphemous and vicious as i'm ripping you from head to toe
there are those who wish you'd leave them the fuck alone
in your face i spit to contradict your lord's integrity
"time to admit, you are swimming in fantasy"
"in a fit of rate, satanic ways you will be crucified"
"bound and determined, your savior will die"

sailing across the seas far and wide

marching through the ashes of conquests
slapping the backs of the empire men
selling our consent in the process – that's you!
that is you and everything you'd be reduced to do
a pledge is a pledge

adamant on what you really meant
a pledge is a pledge is a pledge is a pledge

"an oversight where human rights fall at the fence of ""good trade"""

we went into town on the tuesday night
searching all the places that you hang about
we're looking for you
in the back street cellar dive drinking clubs
in the discotheques and the gaming pubs
we're looking for you
you will pay the price for my own sweet brother
and what he has become
and a hundred other boys and girls
and all that you have done
we picked up the trail at the seven crowns
one of your cronies - he was doing your rounds
we followed him
just a silhouette figure up market pass
where the headlamps shine on the broken glass
we followed him
where the shadows dance on the lighted wall
he stopped to light up a cigarette
and we dived into a doorway
"no police, no summons, no courts of law"
"no proper procedure, no rules of war"
no mitigating circumstance
"no lawyers fees, no second chance"
there are lasses getting trouble on their own home beat
there are old folk battered in the open street
in this city of ours
there are eyes that see but say nothing at all
there are ears that hear but they don't recall
in this city of ours
so we followed your man back to your front door
and we're waiting for you outside
'cos not everybody here is scared of you
not everybody passes on the other side
"no police, no summons, no courts of law..."
and we could spent our whole lives waiting
for some thunderbolt to come
and we could spent our whole lives waiting
for some justice to be done
unless we make our own
"no police, no summons, no courts of law..."

i can see you lying in the ground beyond the gates
i've witnessed violence and i've seen the ones you hate
"they cut you, they beat you, raped you into your grave"
"they let you die and watched you scream, on that bloody day"
rest in piece... just sitting there screaming!
"rest in piece... no, you're not dreaming!"
rest in piece... they cut you all apart!
rest in piece... ripped out your beating heart
i know the torment and the pain that you must feel
"stuck a knife into your body, a nightmare that is real"
"when you sleep, you'll never wake, they cut your life away"
"a corpse inside a body bag, a dead man you will stay"
rest in piece... just sitting there screaming!

every time this year
this dark fog will appear
up from the tombs it comes
to take one more life that
can be near.
in the middle of transylvania
all natural life has for a long
"time ago gone, its thin and so"
beautyful but also so dark and
mysterious.
once again the priest is messing
may the god bless us all.
the fog is here again
that'll complete this funeral.
from a place empty of life.
only dead trees are growing hear
as it comes from a far
only dead treas are growing hear
............funeral fog
............funeral fog
............funeral fog
............funeral fog

pulled along the wayby tanngrisnir and tanngnjost

and if i tell you that our hearts are free again
you'll know i will return
when you hide yourself away
you know you're pretending
when you shed your feelings
when you let them down
many times in life we stray
we're seeking an exit
the solitude is leading to a final call
will you hide in the sea?
will you lay all your sorrow on me?
and if i tell you that our minds are free again
you'll know i will return
so many stars are lightning up along the way
you'll know i will return
back forever
i remember the first time
i dream to be over
"i believed in demons, i believed in saints"
now we see what we became
the dream was forever
since we know the path we won't miss match again
i will rise from the sea
i will take you forever in me
and if i tell you that our hearts are free again
you'll know i will return
so many stars are born each in everyday
you know i will return
back forever more
the dream was forever
we won't miss match again
i will rise from the sea
i will take you forever in me
and if i tell you that our hearts are free again
you'll know i will return
so many stars are born each in everyday
you know i will return

i was lost on winding roads
now i know what i was looking for
"one destination, a place that is safe"
now i know where i belong
"empty rooms, broken dreams"
can you tell me who to trust?
we are in this thing together
but in this circus i am lost

"i live for metal, fight for metal, die for metal"
i fight for you
"i live for metal, fight for metal, die for metal"
you know it's true
"do you feel the power, i can feel the heat"
you have to stay hungry to believe
there are fights you never win
all those times you feel you don't fit in
"never surrender, if you really care"
back to back we stand up strong
"empty rooms, broken dreams"
can you tell me who to trust?
we are in this thing together
but in this circus i am lost
fight for metal
die for metal

die for metal
erase your words and die
we are the livide elite protesters
the faces of justice
and your reign has come to an end
we will hold your head high above your lifeless carcass
we are the livide elite protesters
the faces of justice
"dethroned, de-ranked, we'll take away everything"
and rip your throat out and set you aflame
i will not pledge for i stand against every word
one nation under hypocrisy
we will not live in one nation under hypocrisy
we are the faces of justice fueling anarchy
and your reign has come to an end
we will hold your head high above your lifeless carcass
we are the livide elite protesters
the faces of justice
the masses cringe as they watch you burm
and we stain the eath with your blood
justice has been served
if you dare step on this pedestal and promise us change
we'll change the features on your face
one nation under hypocrisy
erase your words and die
we are the livide elite protesters
the faces of justice
"i will not pledge, for i stand against every word"
one nation under hypocrisy
we will not live in one nation under hypocrisy
we are the faces of justice fueling anarchy
one nation under hypocrisy
can you imagine that it's all up to you?
evil embrace of powers unnatural
you're left in silence nothing more to behold
you close your eyes and visualize the day you'll get away
"it's here, it's near"
i see it all so clear
tonight your flight will take you higher
"it's here, it's near"
you live in whole of fear
tonight's the night that will inspire
crying alone at night your destiny unknown
you're every being full of rage and hate
seems like you're running but you just can not hide
it's in a raging fear all solitude is left behind
"it's here, it's near"
i see it all so clear
tonight your flight will take you higher
"it's here, it's near"
you live in whole of fear
tonight is the night that will inspire
can he comfort thee?
and fill your life with ecstasy
through the darkness
and the pain
will you be the ones again?
disciples of babylon
"it's here, it's near"
i see it all so clear
tonight your flight will take you higher
"it's here, it's near"
you live in whole of fear
tonight is the night that will inspire
can he comfort thee?...
"it's here, it's near"
"it's just beggining, my dear..."
tonight your flight will take you higher
"it's here, it's near"
you live in whole of fear
tonight is the night that will inspire
can he comfort thee?...

someone
got themselves a letter
in the mail the other day
it's already worn and tattered
and i guess
it gives away
all the things we keep inside
all the things that really matter
the face puts on it's best disguise
and all is well
until the heart
betrays
she knows
as she reads her letter
that things were bound to stray
winds blow
she pulls her coat tighter
and the letter flies away
with all the things she keeps inside
all the things that really matter
the face puts on it's best disguise
and all is well
until the heart betrays
lord bring on the night
wrap it all around me
let it hold me tight
soak up all that i bleed
lord bring on the night
wrap it all around me
let it hold me tight
soak up all that i bleed
and i'll fly away
yeah i'll fly away
yeah i'll fly away
watch me
lord bring on the night
wrap it all around me
let it hold me tight
"soak up all that i bleed, yeah yeah"

out along the volga
minds set to kill
men standing ground with iron will
deathmatch approaching
evil in stride
never giving quarter to the other side
gunfire and bloodshed
shredding flesh and bone
as young men die in the killing zone
through streets and factories
fighting hand to hand

two soldiers dying
battered and blind
enemies no more they've come to find
mission forgotten

they hold each other abreast to the final breath
"so hungry, so cold"
but there can be no surrender
"for creed and pride, take hold"
"so hungry, so cold"
we're only following orders
we gave our hearts and souls
"brothers we fight, frozen in time"

the battle of stalingrad...

lying on the ground in your own debris
while choking on your blood from the sodomy
none of you people mean shit to me
sadistic little fucking fantasy
"burn the obedient, set yourself free"
walk the path of secrecy
used to heartless mockery
a hopeless fantasy that nothing changes
your misery
all the damage it just erases
mediocrity all around
the grandlose disorder replaces
"conditions of peace, is this my release?"
none of you people mean shit to me
sadistic little fucking fantasy
lying on the ground in your own debris
while choking on your blood from the sodomy
none of you people mean shit to me
sadistic little fucking fantasy

walk the path of secrecy
used to heartless mockery
a hopeless fantasy that nothing changes
your misery

i stand alone in silence
i’m facing up to my fate
"oh, the time is right"
i hear a voice so tenderly
whispering to me
oh – will my star rise ?
"i’ve been waiting for a sign, so long"
am i the one who falls from grace ?
am i the one to die ?
"touch me, light up the sky"
"be my oasis, be my paradise"
"free me, enlighten my life"
"release me forever, send me a sign"
i move around in circles
i’ve lost my destined way
oh - come and help me now
"turn me loose, break up the ice"
free me from this spell
oh – come and save me
"i’ve been waiting for a sign, so long"
am i the one who falls from grace ?
am i the one to die ?
"touch me, light up the sky"
"be my oasis, be my paradise"
"free me, enlighten my life"
"release me forever, send me a sign"
when the time has come the angels fall from grace
we’re believing in the sign the master sends
we’re believing in the sign he sends
"hear the whisper, in the distance"
echoes die away this night
all the fallen angels drowning in their tears tonight
i’m calling for the wiseman telling me what’s wrong or right
we’re believing in the sign he sent
"touch me, light up the sky"
"be my oasis, be my paradise"
"free me, enlighten my life"
"release me forever, send me a sign"

you are nothing but a puppet
and the greed will burn you first

your self-control has disappeared
when you build around yourself
golden walls it seems
like your shell
but watch your acts
be prepared when
fall your mask
you're the one
you're the mith
you are the ocean
you shape shift
and for the thirst
for the pain
when all is over
wound by wound
trick by trick
you'll see
you'll pay
for all the dakness living
in your soul
for all the freedom you have
been stolen
from my mind you
feed your lamb
with my growth
this way you can say
i'm the king
i'm the king

"i can't pay this price"""

seemingly improving our ways

i'll fly my rockship to a future world
"people come, people come"
join my revolution for a brand new birth
"peace will come, peace will come"
my vision eyes
they have cried me an ocean
just the moon and i
pale faces in the night
and i guess we've both seen some trouble
treasures of gold left us blinded
religion wars in the name of greed... ohh
all around there is chaos and madness
so hard to focus with these
diagnozes in my head
i'll fly my rockship to a future world
"people come, the dream is on"
join my revolution for a brand new birth
"people will come, peace will come"
my vision eyes
they have cried me an ocean
just the moon and i
pale faces in the night
and i've still got some trouble... oh yeahhh
i'll fly my rockship to a future world

just the moon and i
pale faces in the night

"i don't need no money,"
i will stick to my ideals
"you better get some money,"
you better get yourself a deal
i won't change my habits and i throw it all away
"no, no, you better keep it all together for another day"
"money - uh, yeah"
it only makes me sick and makes the people turn to
fools
it only gives you power and power makes the rules.
don't wanna be an asshole that sits on dollar bills
"ha, ha, ha, i know you'll take it no matter how you feel"
"money - uh, yeah"
"nothing you will get for free, illusion or reality"
the mirror of your dreams is made of cash.
"it drives me wild and drives me crazy,"
makes me fat and makes me lazy
"anything you want, anything you need"
"anything you want, anything you need"
if i had a little money i would feel okay
"it is money that rules the world, it is money that"
"lights the day,"
"it is money that makes it work, it is money that makes you live!"
"money, money, money, money"
give me money - everybody wants some
everybody needs some
"i want more, you want more, we want more, they want more"
"nothing you will get for free, illusion or reality"
"anything you want, anything you need"
"anything you want, anything you need"
you can have a little more but still won't feel okay
"it is money that rules the world, it is money that"
"lights the day,"
"it is money that money that makes it work,"
it is money that makes you live!
"hey, hey"

hello my name is mr. know-it-all
my sweet home is deep down in your soul
let me introduce you to the final call
salvation is calling for you
life is just a fairytale
narrated by a lunatic for man
the hope is clouded by eternal haze
tell me what you mean?
do you think about ambition?
why don't you scream? - oh yeah
don't you realize - what you criticize
now remove yourself - away from here
salvation's calling - salvation's calling
the walls are falling - salvation's calling now!
"hey, you think that you blown it all"
"your life, you can't enjoy it to the full"
when all your dreams are fading
to eternal black
you're lost in the twilight
"now, what d'you mean"
what do you think about ambition?
"go out and scream, oh yeah"
realize not criticize
remove yourself away from here
remove yourself away from here
salvation's calling - salvation's calling
the walls are falling - salvation's calling now!
follow you instinct
never follow your illusions
just remember from all your troubles
there is a way out
turn around and see yourself
beyond your horizons
there's an outcry in the void
there is a way out from here
goodbye my friend
it's time to leave you on your own
get going to find out your own way
believe in what you're doing
cos i'm in your head
you can't hesitate anymore
don't think about existence
just move your ass - be yourself
now realize - not criticize
now move yourself - take your chance
salvation's calling - salvation's calling
the walls are falling - salvation's calling now!
harken! - the clouds musteréd in dark -
so painfully easing.
hush! - hearest ye the yew doting;
"its years of yore in a mïre,"
each like a corpse within its grave;
wrought for us a yearn of lief;
'tis not a lore of bale nor loathe;
harmony and æsthesia are its blisses;
ne'er ere hath it exist'd so sonorously -
jostl'd away the pale drape
that us had been o'erhung -
tempt'd thy shutters to open
and thus quenched the hearth;
thou giv'st to misery all thou hast: the cold -
with weal embrac'd the sprounting landscape
like a star of heaven in the broad daylight -
"this joy subdueth until it again waneth,"
save the drooping winter of stalwart.

"mission, to hunt the evil down"
creeping in without a sound
prepare for silent attack
there will be no turning back
"penetrate, isolate, decimate, ambush"
silent supremacy
stalking picking up the trail
never retreat and never fail
got the target move in for the kill
take him out fire at will
[solo]
"campaign over, battle won"
supremacy second to none
"vanished, gone without a trace"
assassins for the human race
no sign of life did flicker
in floods of tears she cried
"""all hope's lost it can't be undone"
"they're wasted and gone"""
"""save me your speeches"
i know what you want
(they blinded us all)
you will take it away from me
take it and i know for sure
the light she once brought in
"is gone forever more"""
like sorrowful seaguls they sang
"""(we're) lost in the deep shades"
the misty cloud brought
(a wailing when beauty was gone
come take a look at the sky)
monstrous it covered the shore
"fearful into the unknown"""
quietly it crept in new horror
insanity reigned
it spilled the first blood
when the old king was slain
nightfall
quietly crept in and changed us all
nightfall
quietly crept in and changed us all
nightfall
immortal land lies down in agony
"""how long shall we mourn in the dark"
the bliss and the beauty will not return
say farewell to sadness and grief
"though long and hard the road may be"""
but even in silence i heard the words
"""an oath we shall swear by the name of the one"
until the world's end
"it can't be broken"""
just wondering how
i can still hear these voices inside
the doom of the noldor drew near
the words of a banished king
"""i swear revenge"""
filled with anger aflamed our hearts
full of hate full of pride
we screamed for revenge
nightfall
quietly crept in and changed us all
nightfall
quietly crept in and changed us all
nightfall
immortal land lies down in agony
"""vala he is that's what you said"
then your oath's been sworn in vain
(but) freely you came and
ýou freely shall depart
(so) never trust the northern winds
"never turn your back on friends"""
"""oh i'm heir of the high lord!"
"""you better don't trust him"""
the enemy of mine
isn't he of your kind and
finally you may follow me
"farewell, he said"
nightfall
quietly crept in and change us all
nightfall
quietly crept in and change us all
nightfall
immortal land lies down in agony
back to where it all began
back to where it all began
lost in a world that only criticizes all of my sins
who are they to say they understand
the way that i've had to live
there was a day that we could live or die upon the sword
of all the words we've spoken
such a tragedy to everyone and so much more
i need to know
are we livin' in a picture show
that these feelings that we feel are
black and white
i feel that i'm comin' to the point of no return
the pyre that will show us the way
the point of no return
the vision that releases all our pain
cast down your promises
the revolutions that i should believe
as you touch the tender face of innocence
not mutually agreed
send me conviction promise that all the words you say
come from the other side
written down only yesterday
i need to know
are we livin' in a picture show
that these feelings that we feel are black and white
i feel that i'm comin' to the point of no return
the pyre that will show us the way
the point of no return
the vision that releases all our pain
save me give back my soul
hopeless world guess that i'll never know
so long into the abyss
i give myself into the point
the point of no return
the pyre that will show us the way
the point of no return
the vision that releases all our pain
believe in me - send no money
"i died on the cross, and that ain't funny"
but my so called friends they're making me a joke
they missed out what i said like i never spoke
they choose what they wanna hear - they don't tell a lie
they just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
saving your soul by taking your money
"flies around shit, bees around honey"
"holy smoke, holy smoke, plenty bad preachers for"
the devil to stoke
feed 'em in feet first this is no joke
this is thirsty work making holy smoke
jimmy reptile and all his friends
say they gonna be with you at the end
"burning records, burning books"
"holy soldiers, nazi looks"
"crocodile smiles, just wait awhile"
till the tv queen gets her make up clean
"i've lived in filth, i've lived in sin"
and i still smell cleaner than the shit you're in
"holy smoke, holy smoke, this plenty bad preachers for"

feed 'em in feet first this is no joke
this is thirsty work making holy smoke
they ain't religious but they ain't no fools
when noah built his cadillac it was cool
two by two they're still going down
and the satellite circus just left town
i think they're strange and when they're dead
they can have a lincoln for their bed
friend of the president - trick of the tail
now they ain't got a prayer - 100 years in jail
"holy smoke, holy smoke, plenty bad preachers for"
the devil to stoke
feed 'em in feet first this is no joke
this is thirsty work making holy smoke

take away the wine
for restlessness plagues me...
i am assailed by a spectre profounder
than hatred and grief or the sum of their hideous crime
i shalt suffer this confessional mime
"awaiting the sun to set, crimsoning seas"
only once it is dark doth my misery cease
she died to a sky dressed in flame
eyes full of curses for her killers by choice
who fell to their god o'er her vision and voice
"""i am as dusk come to ravish the light"""
steal me from their stares and mute christ into night
"""i will answer the prayers"""
if thou wouldst drink of my life...
when young
there's so many questions to ask
you grow and you have learn things so fast
"as kid, everything looks like a dream"
"somehow, dreams are not what they seem"
you need the learnin'
you need to to know
there is but one way that you can go
"at school, there's so many words to be read"
"you fool, nothing is learned from your bed"
don't you know we're all equal at first
"you'll feel, the lack of knowledge like thirst"
"you talk, but your words they don't make no sense"
"why try, when you are not feelin' no tense"
"you'll flunk, your effort is layin' too low"
"you punk, you're just too stupid to know"
"the girl in the bloody dress, appearing right before my eyes"
"the girl in the bloody dress, crossing over from the other side"
i see the moon in the black of night
"i see her dirty face, oh"
the little girl in the bloody dress… closer… and closer
i feel her eyes in my soul
looking around seeing all i have done
all i have done with my life
"the girl in the bloody dress, i know why she’s here tonight"
"the girl in the bloody dress, looking for"
something deep inside my mind
i see the moon in the black of night
"i see her dirty face, oh"
the little girl in the bloody dress… closer… and closer
i feel her eyes in my soul
looking around seeing all that i have done
all i have done… with my life
“do not be afraid there won’t be any
"pain, i… need your soul”"
"no no no, my soul is full… of sin"
[solo : andy]
"the girl in the bloody dress, she’s hiding her hands in the dark"
"the girl in the bloody dress, carrying the devil’s mark"
i see the moon in the black of night
"i see her dirty face, oh"
the little girl in the bloody dress… closer… and closer
i feel her hands on my own
"holding them down, they are so full of blood"
her brother’s blood
"and my soul is no good at all, you got to move on now"
you gotta move on before the dawn is here
[solo : mike]
i feel her hands on my own
"holding them down, they are so full of blood"
her brother’s blood… red
"“i know i let my brother down, to hell… he must go”"
no no no… you still have time… tick… tock
on a dim december morning
"a glass of ""i forgot the name"""
i can't turn wine to water
i won't come back again
and the minutes turn to hours
i keep spinning cards that look the same
and so i await the moment
to talk to you
"please shine, oh night, my dear, embrace me"
it's time again
all light is banned
my soul is free
and blessed to see
sometimes when i'm out of reach
and sometimes when i'm there
that is when our souls agree and join in solitaire
sometimes when my will to love has gone away
that is when i hear your name
now the pale sunlight is blinding
it's here to claim my sanity
and i just can't stand the waiting
to revive ecstasy
"please shine, oh night, my dear, embrace me"
it's time again
all light is banned
my soul is free
and blessed to see
sometimes when i'm out of reach
and sometimes when i'm there
that is when our souls agree to join in solitaire
sometimes when my will to love has gone away
that is when i hear
i won't sustain another day
"my love, my darkness"
daylight reflects my starving soul
and open wounds for everyone to see
sometimes when i'm out of reach
and sometimes when i'm there
that is when our souls agree to join in solitaire
sometimes when my will to love has gone away
that is when i hear you
sometimes when i'm out of reach
and sometimes when i'm there
that is when our souls agree to join in solitaire
sometimes when my will to love has gone away
that is when i hear your name
i wanna hear you name
hear your name

"[music: p. wagner, c. efthimiadis, m. schmidt/lyrics: p. wagner]"
i won't go where you've gone
'cause it showed that it does not work.
if you stay where you are then you will bite the dust.
and i know what i know
i believe what my eyes can tell -
you're no longer so sure
that you've done it right.
why did you what you've done?
all that's left is you've lost our trust.
all the people believe not a word that you say.
and you think you're so clever
that it makes you a better man
but for real you just live on the cost of us all.
"bastard, you bastard, stay where you are!"
i don't believe you a word.
lies are a weapon that kills from inside.
if there's no change you'll bury all life.
you steal from us all what we need to survive
looks like soon you will bury all life.
open your eyes and see there's no way you can turn it back
when you sell what's not yours when you rape mother earth.
now start making an end
a beginning to stop that waste.
do you really believe
you could own all this land?
"bastard, you bastard, get outta my way!"
i don't believe you a word.
lies are a weapon that kills from inside.
if there's no change you'll bury all life
you steal from the world what it needs to survive
looks like soon you will bury all life.
looks like soon you will bury all life.
say good bye to your true love
one step further from me
i can't decide which way to take it
stand alone and don't look back
music is coming 'round the past
"take it, we'll all twist again"
"once you find it, stay close behind it"
"you're still waiting, this time for me"
"once we're playing, now we're praying"
one step closer
one step closer
one step closer
"live fast, don't you talk trash"
someone's waiting right on your ass
"take it, this time we're gonna make it"
roaming round this time around
i guess you all know what's coming down
take it
"once you find it, stay close behind it"
"you're still waiting, this time for me"
"once we're playing, now we're praying"
one step closer
one step closer
one step closer
it's my heart feeling heavy
down about the way that you treat me
is your love still on fire
show that your touch has desire
if i give you all i need
would you still be there for me
"i don't think so...no, no, no"
i can't wait any longer
can't you see that i feel like i'm going
down in flames...you're taking control
of my heart and i'm going
down in flames...straight to the ground over you.
must i be so mistreated
now there's no more to be foregiven
i can't play any longer
time that i became just a wanderer
had you said you'd really cared
don't you know that i'd be there
"i don't think so...no, no, no"
i can't wait any longer
can't you see that i feel like i'm going
down in flames...you're taking control
of my heart and i'm going
down in flames...straight to the ground over you.
down in flames...you're taking control
of my heart and i'm going
down in flames...straight to the ground over you.
[solo]
"send back my heart, give me control"
"must i be so mistreated, there's no win or lose"
i guess i'm goin'
i guess i'm goin'

aint no reason i should stay
something deep inside tells me i should keep a place
i know its hard for you to understand
if i let you go hope you understand
i know how you feel been down that magic road before
but it isn't real what are you lookinâ€™ for?
you gave no words to stop the pain
we sight a moment like a grain of sand
i know its hard for you to understand
so many reasons lost within a glance
i know how you feel been down that magic road before
but it isn't real what are you lookinâ€™ for?
i know how you feel been down that magic road before

you never see him out in the sunlight
he's waiting for the shadows to fall
moving under cover of darkness
searching for a victim to maul
lock up your doors tightly
keep all your windows shot
on this night the blood will flow
flow before the dawn
in the night wrap up tight
vampire strikes
bloodletter
scream in the night keep out of sight
roaming in the valley of darkness
never moving far from the grave
waiting at the edge of your nightmare
seeking out the blood that he graves
so if you hear a tap on your window
you know that you're time has come
on this night the blood will flow
flow before the dawn

at the end of the dream
if you know where i mean
when the mist just starts to clear
in a similar way
at the end of today
i could feel the sound of writing on the wall
it cries for you
it's the least that you can do
like a spiral on the wind
i can hear it screaming in my mind
long live rock'n'roll
in a different time
when the words didn't rhyme
you could never quite be sure
then on with the change
it was simple but strange
and you knew the feeling seemed to say it all
it cries for you
it's the least that you can do
like a spiral on the wind
i can hear it screaming in my mind
if you suddenly see
what was happened with me
you should spread the word around
and tell everyone here
that it's perfectly clear
they can sail above it all on what they've found
it cries for you
it's the least that you can do
like a spiral on the wind
i can hear it screaming in my mind
you wanna go to heaven but you never want to die
a silent scream for freedom turn to
fire turn to water turn to
"stone's the same, the sky's the same, it doesn't roll away"
the other side where life goes on is
close and yet you know it's just a lie
but you're stronger than they are
feel the wind in your hair
and you're faster than they are
and it feels that you're lighter than air
when you're drawn to the ground by the dragons
"would you raise up your head, would you gaze at the sky"
when you're drawn to the ground by the dragons
"would you raise up your head, would you cry"
and all the wicked prisons that they built inside your mind
"and all the wicked borders that unite us, that divide us, until"
death ever different will embrace us in the end
"but roll away the stone, and hear the"
wind will whisper out your name
but you're stronger than they are
feel the wind in your hair
and you're faster than they are
and it feels that you're lighter than air
when you're drawn to the ground by the dragons
"would you raise up your head, would you gaze at the sky"
when you're drawn to the ground by the dragons
"would you raise up your head, would you cry"
dun nun nun

"but i don't listen to her,"

we been losing our mind
at the end of our time
"riding on the ship of fools, the walls will be diturbed"
"they're on their way to hell and back, the legions of the glory"
"they're coming home, they touched the light, in the misty morning"
we been losing our mind
at the end of our time
"the cry of the nations, a lake of silent screams"
it turned out to be broken dreams
imprisoned in chains (and) don't know what it means
locked up in a cage of broken dreams
a cloud filled up with water (is) falling from the sky
"the wizard cried, the demon danced, sure they don't know why"
the desert storm takes over now the labirynth of sin
"holy nights of dangerous games, will they ever win"
we been losing our mind
at the end of our time
"the cry of the nations, a lake of silent screams"
it turned out to be broken dreams
imprisoned in chains (and) don't know what it means
locked up in a cage of broken dreams
born into a world of terror
born into a reign of fear…
"of fear and death, fear and death"
born into a world of fools
born into a reign – without rules
hate
"i’m the law, i’m the war"
don’t hide don’t run
you can trust me i’m the terrible one
"lost his father, lost his trust,"
looked away in sad disgust
"his mother was killed,"
through a poison affair
at the age of thirteen he
smelled blood in the air
young ivan gathered for the crown
to be king of the kings
and bring the people down
hate – pain
"i’m the law, i’m the war"
don’t hide don’t run
you can trust me i’m the terrible one
and what of passion
and what of shame
"we have suffered baby ,both the same"
and what of regret
and what of hate
the price we pay is all too great
can this stop your thoughtless ways?
i hope and pray for better days
disguised behind the lies
"do you not realize, this is heartless?"
this is heartless
disguised behind the lies
"do you not realize, this is heartless?"
this is cut throat
and what of forgiveness
and what of pain
does your venom spew my name?
and what of resentment
so what of the doubt?
vicious actions deserve repremant
can this stop your thoughtless ways?
i hope andpray for better days
disguised behind the lies
"do you not realize, this is heartless"
this is heartless
disguised behind the lies
"do you not realize, this is heartless?"
this is cut throat
the freaks in the streets
the nuns with the shot gun
the graves rollin' by your side
survival of the fittest
and there ain't no pitty
no one gets out alive
in the concrete jungle
it's the well of the damned
step inside and you'll understand
"misfits, psychos and the twisted slaves"
the house of the sane
no one can be saved
rolling six feet under ( rollin' )
rolling six feet under ( rollin' )
roll and keep on rolling
no one gets out
they're ready to die once again
no one gets out
they're ready to die
another day to bleed
another day to die
another day to blackout and then go blind
maniacal - blitzkrieged
where the maggots play god
where the souls of the lost come to die
the concrete jungle
it's the well of the damned
step inside and you'll understand
"misfits, psychos and the twisted slaves"
the house of the sane
no one can be saved
rolling six feet under ( rollin' )
rolling six feet under ( rollin' )
roll and keep on rolling
no one gets out
they're ready to die once again
no one gets out
they're ready to die
spiritual isolation - the ultimate frustration
"scratch the surface, tuurn another page"
the ugly truth or another pretty lie
"you deceived me, i believed you"
why did everything go...
so wrong...
for so long...
so the truth comes out at last
i'm dead inside
(i'm burning up)
a hollow shell
(my private hell)
in my own misery
you leave me to dwell
then we were young and strong
now everything is wrong
"did you want me, did you need me"
could you not say you believed me?
everything we had is gone...
like an old forgotten song
the deceiver and believer
now everything is...
so wrong... for so long.
"[music: kasparek, lyrics: kasparek]"
the holy sword of fire is burning through the lands
wisards and witches - their torture never ends
religious madness creates this hell on earth
"the ""holy"" inquisition is spreading its curse"
"murder, lies and slanders, 'cause they want to rule"
"madmen and fools, they left a sea of running blood"
hundreds of pyres are burning in the night
"caluminated victims of ""inquisition's"" strike"
"pray for the tortured, tears for their pain"
"misanthropic blindness, a dog without a chain"
"murder, lies and slanders, 'cause they want to rule"
"madmen and fools, they left a sea of running blood"
we are guided by the moon
into our palace tomb
shrine of dead king midas
whose gold turned into stone
children of the grave
entombed in a faceless day
are we the ones insane
to carry a spirit flame
skeleton of centuries
oh solemn majesty
you'll stand again
unveil the key
grant life to we
on this violet night
we await your sight
as the splendour falls
upon these naked walls
in the haunted garden
a velvet raven calls
temples born of ice
release a solemn chime
into twilight thunder
within the sands of time
skeleton of centuries
eternal mysteries
released from pain
again we die
to breathe in vain
seared wealth of truth
by your touch restored
summer seized in the grip of twilight fair
as we conceive to retrieve our rightful fortune
"mourn not we, in lost shapes of time reborn"
to bathe in seas of you - oh blackest dawn
we find salvation in a palace of dead kings
hold a knife to the dawn - climb into the dream
i could've told you
"all these tears, what good to they do"
all these years my life's been living
it's a shame you've not been giving
so tell me what to do
"and i'll be there for you, only for you"
"when love finds a fool like me, it doesn't see"
"when love finds a fool, baby, like me"
i could've been the one
sad empty faces look to my eyes
they seem to know me
i can take the rejection
all i need is your affection
i should've seen it coming
you should've said 'goodbye'
i guess you were right

i'm not a fish
i'm a man
revolution in their minds
the children start to march
against the world in which they have to live
and all the hate that's in their hearts
they're tired of being pushed around
and told just what to do
they'll fight the world until they've won
and love comes flowing through
children of tomorrow live in
the tears that fall today
will the sunrise of tomorrow
bring them peace in any way
must the world live
in the shadow of atomic fear
can they win the fight for peace
or will they disappear?
so you children of the world
listen to what i say
if you want a better place to live in
spread the words today
show the world that love
is still alive you must be brave
or you children of today
are children of the grave
we have come too far
to let our fulfillment fall away
i must refuse to renounce my integrity
we stand in defiance
to their excess
let the grief that they have inflicted serve as a call to arms
are you ready?
are you willing?
to be the catalyst
we can no longer be indifferent
restore this tired world
for misery
we have turned away
ignite the past
my eyes watch the unholy be left in the distance
the division of our souls from our blasphemous tongues
this is our fulfillment
for misery
we have turned away
ignite the past
from sorrow
we have turned away
to the past
i have bled for the truth
there is no surrender
"move forward, go make yourself"
destroy all lies
from ashes to ashes
from dust to dust
from ashes to ashes
from dust to dust
for misery
we have turned away
ignite the past
sometimes it seems you're invisible

"hello, hello, you gonna be the star in this dimension you are"
"you are, you are"
"hello, hello, a man in the mirror, a mirror bizarre"
there is a sun in the dark
a touch of evil comes apart
"all your tears, all your fears"
in the end the game restarts
see the sun in the night
a big sin city light
but the game of life collides
"hush, hush, don't be shy, how cynical"
"no id on the pc, so practical"
"you're the man in the spot of this digital masquerade, masquerade"
"no way back to reality, too sensible"
"caught in the act, no respect, so tragical"
"this is the end of this magical opera, opera"
there is a sun in the dark
a touch of evil comes apart
"all your tears, all your fears"
in the end the game restarts
see the sun in the night
a big sin city light
but the game of life collides
but the game of life collides
but the game of life collides
but the game of life collides
there is a sun in the dark
a touch of evil comes apart

why have a plan for humanity
when you haven't done anything yourself?
if i were you i'd run and hide
because a beautiful darkness has arrived
the one you call father is dead and gone
i slit his throat
(i slit his throat!)
resurrected him and did it...
again!
this bitter world is in my hands
no false pretentiousness
son of man will inhibit the structures
i've devised
"beneath the clouded smoke,"
beneath the acid rain
the tombs of a fallen race are revived
and reprogrammed to hate!
reprogrammed to hate!
but why have a plan for humanity
when you haven't done anything yourself?
if i were you i'd run and hide
because a beautiful darkness has arrived
the one you call father is dead and gone
i slit his throat
(i slit his throat!)
resurrected him and did it again!
these drones of hell will rid the smell
of putrid human failure
man is his own worst enemy
how could you hope
how could you dream
for such impossibilities
man is his own worst enemy
man is his own worst enemy
man is his own worst enemy
what doesn't kill you makes you
a victim of eternal torture
what doesn't kill you makes you
a victim of infernal flames
this isn't a plea for power
it's the beginning of a revolution
the revolution of extermination
the revolution of total control
"i have nothing, nothing to hide!"
i am the alpha and the omega!
"i have nothing, nothing to hide!"
imprisoned with no afterlife!
why have a plan for humanity
when you haven't done anything yourself?
if i were you i'd run and hide
because a beautiful darkness has arrived
why have a plan for humanity
when you haven't done anything yourself
if i were you...
i'd run and hide!
wake the fuck up! (x8)
"each day, more frightening"
all of us wanna die
the pressure's tightening
i don't even want to try

wake the fuck up! (x4)
i can take no more
what are we fighting for?

i wish they'd just..
wake the fuck up! (x4)
i can take no more
what are we fighting for?
you are my brothers

what are we fighting for?
you are my brothers
each one i would die for
please just let it go
all our heads are blown
let's just take the stage
and remember why we play for
remember why we play for
remember why we play for
now i'm here can you see me?
'cos i'm out on my own
when the room goes cold tell me you can feel me
'cos i'm here
"here i am, can you see me"
passing through on my way
to a place i'd been to only in my dreams
... before
in a world of delusion
never turn your back on a friend
'cos you can count your real true friends on one hand
...through life
there are those that deceive you
there are those that'll let you down
is there someone out there that would die for you
...thought not
live your life with a passion
"everything you do, do well"
you only get out of life what you put in
...so they say
in a world of confusion
people never say what they mean
if you want a straight answer go look for one
...right now
in a room full of strangers
do you stand with your back to the wall
do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside
...looking in?
you can make your own luck
you create your destiny
i believe you have the power if you want to
...it's true
you can do what you want to
if you try a little bit harder
a little bit of faith goes a long way
...it does
are we here for a reason?
i'd like to know just what you think
it would be nice to know what happens when we die
...wouldn't it?
there are some who are wise
there are some who are born naive
i believe that there are some
that must have lived before
...don't you?
"as for me, well i'm thinking"
you gotta keep an open mind
but i hope that my life's not an open and shut case
extrasensory perception
"life after death, telepathy"
can the soul live on and travel
through space and time?
you know i feel so elated
'cos i'm about to find it out
and when i know the answers
maybe then i'll come back
...to fill you in
you don't be alarmed now
if i try to contact you
if things go missing or get moved around
...it's me
and don't disbelieve it
"no matter what your ""friends"" might say"
we'll meet up again
someplace some way one day
i'm deep in my sorrow and feeling down
not waiting for rapture to come around
with nothing to lose i'm about to clear my mind
so many times i have dealt with my pain
and now it is driving me almost insane
i had a future but now it is left far behind
then out of the comer comes a light
"taking my breath, divine and bright"
"changing my world, left me adrift"
so silently
i have tried to comprehend
i've hid my pride and made amends
but all i had was misery to see
when i'm close to her it's so intense
"i hold her tight, it makes no sense"
cause still she is a mystery to me
ain't taking it for granted what we've got
but i'm willing to give it my best shot
avoiding the darkest whispers from my past
"i've got no regrets, i've got no remorse"
this is my life and i've chosen my course
i'm taking the challenge and i know it's gonna last
then out of the comer comes a light
"taking my breath, divine and bright"
"changing my world, left me adrift"
so silently
i have tried to comprehend
i've hid my pride and made amends
but all i had was misery to see
when i'm close to her it's so intense
"i hold her tight, it makes no sense"
cause still she is a mystery to me
i have tried to comprehend
i've hid my pride and made amends
cause still she is a mystery to me
i have tried to comprehend
i've hid my pride and made amends
but all i had was misery to see
when i'm close to her it's so intense
"i hold her tight, it makes no sense"
cause still she is a mystery to me
a mystery to me
a mystery to me
well i don't care if i lose my hair
i don't care if you strip me bare
i don't care if you think i'm sick
i'm just a mad dog doin' my trick
'cause i'm a mad dog
a mad bad dog
i'm just a mad dog
chasing cars or burying my bone
i'm a stray looking for a home
on the corner just hanging around
"i'm a depraved, deranged flea-bitten hound"
ain't hydrophobic
no need to run
i'm just a mad dog
having fun
looking for a bitch in heat
begging for a doggy treat
you know my bark is worse than my bite
you'll hear me howling in the heat of the night
feel my bite
oww!!!
oww!!!

i told you once but i will say it again
when you live the flesh it is the beginning
of the end
it will take you in
it will spit you out
behold the flesh and the power it holds
passion is a poison laced with pleasure bitter sweet
one of many faces that hide deep beneath
it will take you in
it will spit you out
behold the flesh and the power it holds
"touch, taste, breathe, consumed"
deja-vu. already knew from the first encounter
but know i know to let go of words to speak no more
like a wind upon your face you can't see it
"but you know it's there, when beauty shows"
"its ugly face, just be prepared."
[solo schuldiner]
passion burns like fire carried by the wind
"the end of a time, a time to begin"
it builds you up one way and tears
"you right back down, a time to begin"
the end of a time.
"touch, taste, breathe, consumed."
now it's time
to shake it all up to be free
now it's time
to make us some room
to let us be
"oh, it feels so bad"
yes it feels so bad
when everything good
looks so bad
when everything right
goes so wrong
"i am up, to break it all"
down what's in my way
"i won't stop, until i am"
where i'm going to stay
no one holds me back
"no, no one holds me back"
don't wanna be what i'm not
but it's gotta be myself
who breaks my neck
(over my head
look over my head
you won't see no halo)
i look here and you look there
i know it's got to be somewhere
we look around and search around
and walk around and hear around
we keep on looking
'til we know what for
(it's driving me mad
i must hold it back inside)
if you don't know it
i don't know it
we don't know it
who will know it?
all of us don't know
what we should know
maybe one day we'll know
but anyway we've got
to make a stop
when the sinner searches sin
it's all of us
when we finally search inside
it's under us
we keep on looking anyway
if we don't find it
who must pay?
all i've ever done
i've done to you
"in my mind, the battle"
goes on 'til i give up
will we find the key of life
we once have dropped?
do you really care?
tell me you really care!
you may find mr. blame
but the guilt of life
burns everywhere
(over my head
look over my head
you won't see no halo)
give me light to see my inside
give me light to see my sin
i'd never do what i regret
i've never done anything bad
you must be joking
when you point at me!
(it's driving me mad
i must hold it back inside)
hey! don't you blame me!
don't you touch me!
won't you ever leave me be?
i wanna live! don't wanna think!
why should i give what i can drink?
man! life is short so
i take what i need!
when the sinner searches sin
it's all of us
when we finally search inside
it's under us
we keep on looking anyway
if we don't find it
who must pay?
all i've ever done
i've done to you!
pain!
i feel inside it's such a
shame!
"no one fights fair, but who's to"
blame?
might be the game of life
but it ain't over
now!
i walk my way firm any
how!
my conscience speaks
and there are
doubts!
but nothing's sure in life
and it ain't over
now!
(over my head
look over my head
you won't see no halo)
i look here and you look there

all i've ever done
i've done to you
theres a cause to light my call
and when i speak
theres a fire underneath
but i wont divulge it all
i know that line
i will cross or hide behind
"want, need for my all"
let me breathe
when time outruns my soul
i dont have to hide
fear is not my guide
i wont be made to hold
any word inside
fear is not my guide
i will not rescind a word
of what ive said
for the vultures overhead
but for every line i vent
another ten
im afraid id lose you then
"want, need for my all"
let me breathe
when time outruns my soul
i dont have to hide
fear is not my guide
i wont be made to hold
any word inside
fear is not my guide
as i learn to count my days the less i care to veil
something of a deeper truth is begging to exhale
when the time has come to bleed
and air my fill
will you be there for me still?
will you turn and walk away?
well then i know
you were never there at all
when time outruns my soul
i dont have to hide
fear is not my guide
i wont be made to hold
any word inside
fear is not my guide
when time outruns my soul
i don't have to hide
death is on my side
in the house of my master
beyond the chains there is a bed
of snakes where evil lays
"oh, i hear laughter"
i forged the iron bars that
someday will imprison me
"ooh, mother will you help me"
mother will you help me
to find a reason to go on
out of the ashes of my youth
- i rise a man
and through the eyes of truth
- i finally understand
the way
i've been beaten with his words
and whipped with his lies
he will not break me down no
matter how hard he tries
pray for my lost soul
out of control the storm inside
me rages on and on and on
mother will you help me
mother will you help me
to find a reason to go on
out of the ashes of my youth
- i rise a man
and through the eyes of truth
- i finally understand
the way
[solo]
out of the ashes of my youth
- i rise a man
and through the eyes of truth
- i finally understand
the way
put to the sword by an impish whim
follow me now to a place we begin
"wrought with no anger, wrought with no fear"
devilish children playing here
"hidden in silence, below barren waste"
"confusion hunger, am i still awake?"
have i ever told you about my time machine
"sit you down, i'll tell you everywhere i've been"
"i have lived a long life, life extraordinaire"
"let me tell you about it, let me take you there"
"does it really matter, it's all in the mind"
"let me tell you about it, listen what you'll find"
"i am not a preacher, i am but a man"
you cannot imagine what i've seen and done
"i have lived a long life, i have seen the world"
"i could tell you stories, hair will stand on end"
"stand among the steeples, stand upon the walls"
"i have seen a god's face, i have no disgrace"
"i have seen the gods cry, howling in the wind"
"where do i get started, when can i begin"
"i am not a preacher, i am but a man"
you cannot imagine what i've seen and done
sleep with a light that is dark to my eyes
"father and sons, give me all of your lies"
"the brutal truth, that is never a lie"
"full moon is out, as you look to the sky"
"i am not a preacher, i am but a man"
you cannot imagine what i've seen and done
open your heart and i'll open your soul
even in quieter moments i know
"i am not a preacher, i am but a man"
you cannot imagine what i've seen and done
"eerie collection, darkness is there, wedded to danger"
betrothed to despair

blunt / on the cutting / edge
this is a stylistic disaster
or so i'm told
won't meet your estimations
do well to fold
can't keep up
to the (dummy) run
am i redundant ?
integrity dressed down
by the cuts of their threads
nice and neat
(with a) sideline in grief ?
i'll say inkempt
a real cutting edge is the scourge of the norm
"for all the angst, you're tantrum-fuelled dolls"
abrasiveness a convenience
sell for a score
come up clean doing the dirty
"cut and run, then dissolve"
mould in motion
see straight through
transparent you
a real cutting edge is the scourge of the norm
"for all the angst, you're tantrum-fuelled dolls"
"i'm blunted, i'm blunted against the cutting edge"
sharpeness diminished through truth to myself
"i'm rusted, i'm rusted against the cutting edge"
sigh-times cloud over when met with pretence
"together,"
drop the act !
drop the act !
"i'm blunted, i'm blunted against the cutting edge"
sharpeness diminished through truth to myself
"i'm rusted, i'm rusted against the cutting edge"
sigh-times cloud over when met with pretence
drop the act !
hope seize the invisible
achieves the impossible
"if you look up, there are no limits…"
billion lights burn the dark
from sky to sky we climb up
more and more it will never stop
ambition shines like sun
"in our heart, in you our eyes"
speculation rules the game
"all for sex, money and fame"
now every night i dream about the ride
got a stair need a horse with over-sized wings
conquer to conquer
conquer...conquer it all
clash of prayers in electric sea
i stand like a tower stronger than me
all is full of power for those who can see
don't believe the liars who don't want you to be
now every night i dream about the ride
billion lights burn the dark
from sky to sky we climb up
more and more it will never stop
now every night i dream about the ride
got a stair need a horse with over-sized wings
conquer to conquer
conquer...conquer it all
conquer to conquer
conquer...conquer it all
"conquer it all, conquer it all"
it's been a long time since i've been with you
you may be grey-green
but matchless and wide
i wanted to sniff at every inch of you
went to birmingham new street
to take a ride
over adqueducts on a suspiciously panting train
high on diesel fumes i poundered on my way
"i may like new york, bavaria or paris"
"but nothing comapres to you, england"
cause england's got steve harris
"england, i know"
i may have explained it somewhere before
but i swear it wasn't my idea
to contrieve that silly way
"okay, i've got to admit"
"this was, uhm, an improper try of a joke"
but it rhymed and talking humour
you're to know i'm just anosser
german bloke
who loves afternoon tea
and bob catley and mr. bean
who loves to buy miniature phone booths
and cute little snow globes raining snow
on a cute little queen
mostly you're jolly
"at times you're frustrated, england"
then rest assured
i also think penalty shootouts
are highly overrated
vienna has got mozart
chopin they had in paris (kind of)
the catholics got the pope
england's got the beatles
and even more so
england's got steve harris
(solo)
england's got steve harris
and as if that was not enough for you
england's got bruce dickinson
and on top of it the other ones
"in iron maiden too, yes it's true"
vienna's got the mozart ball
the frenchies they got paris
in rome they got the pope
who in turn they don't have in england
but england's got steve harris
"i may like new york, bavaria or paris"
"but nothing compares to you, england"
cause you got the magic bullet
england's got steve harris

we're walking in the air
we're floating in the moonlit sky
the people far below are sleeping as we fly
i'm holding very tight
i'm riding in the midnight blue
i'm finding i can fly so high above with you
far across the wold
the villages go by like trees
the rivers and the hills
the forests and the streams
children gaze open mouth
taken by surprise
nobody down below believes their eyes
we're surffing in the air
we're swimming in the frozen sky
we're drifting over icy
mountain floating by
suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep
arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep
we're walking in the air
we're floating in the midnight sky
and everyone who sees us greets us as we fly
why do i feel this way?
deep in my mind i know that i should stay away
"anyway i go, down below"
down to the cellar where the little girl just might show
the dark is so much darker here
the candlelight can’t break the sensation of fear
i see a trail of blood
leading down into the dark where no one should go
"i shouldn’t be down here, not tonight"
"evil is in the air, tonight"
"i shouldn’t be down here, not tonight"
everything is closing in on me
"here i am, in the dark, there’s no return"
then in a halo of light… i see a shape… i know it’s her… ohh
so many black little wings meet me as i enter the cellar
"so many black little wings, black little wings on my face"
"oh no no no, i cannot see, i cannot see what’s going on"
"i hear her breathe, i hear her wheeze"
and then she points her little finger right at me
[solo : andy]
"“mine mine mine mine, give me your soul please"
mine mine mine mine”
stay away from me
"“mine mine mine mine, give me your soul please"
mine mine mine mine”
oh no no no
i… i’ve got the get away
her piercing eyes will burn deep into my mind
i slowly turn around
"i can feel her closing in, and then i’m falling down"
the dark is so much darker than before
the candle in my hand doesn’t burn anymore
i think i’m losing my mind
"as i’m barely crawling out, out of this place"
"i shouldn’t b down there, not tonight"
i can’t believe i made it out of there
look inside my eyes
you can see everywhere i've been
"you can drag me down, i'll come right back again."
you gotta hold on to every little thing
every little bag of bones
when the love's gone you shoot from the hip
you make or break it on your own
love takes your heart away and gives it back in pieces
i look at myself and say now all i have to say)
(is)'i know who to believe in'
"mirror, mirror on the wall"
"i'm still here, i survived it all"
"mirror, mirror, tell me more."
if that was love then love is war.
i am gonna fight until i win
"another place in time, i might have given in"
i don't know what to do
i don't know who you are
i'm calling from the silence
we have gone too far
"i try to understand you, your life has been so cruel"
please try to see it my way
i've got something to say
all those years
were not in vain
even though there was much pain
i try to learn from my mistakes
i want to make it up to you
a million light years away from you
i am
a million light years away from you
i hope that you'd respect my
honesty and faith
and maybe you'd forgive me
if i could make you see
i want to say i'm sorry
for what i did to you
i'll get on with my life
i hope you do that too
all those years
were not in vain
even though there was much pain
i try to learn from my mistakes
i want to make it up to you
a million light years away from you
i am
a million light years away from you
i'm wearing thin wearing out becoming weak
holding hands with this rope she's my self-destructive
bleeding disease the things that makes it hard to breathe
but if i shoved you far away
this addict just starved again asphyxiated
and now i see it's you that's tearing me ensnaring me
this is me dying in your arms i cut you out now set me free
lynched high above what used to be
in her gallows built for me
so i escaped cut this noose around my
neck i break free to see the things you blinded me
and i shoved you far away
now i live the life i dreamed of
you're dead to me
you poisoned my life
so i take this knife
and i cut you out
cut you out
"i heard you've been looking for me but, you looked for trouble."
you're gonna see that your words are dangerous. your talk is cheap.
so now i'm standin' here. now i'm standin' here.
you tell yourself you know what to do and you realize that i am comin' for you then you'll change your mind and run like a child when...
you see me standin' here! now i'm standin' here!
don't question my heart! don't question the fire that burns inside!
don't question my heart! don't question a heart prepare to fight!
i got where i am because i didn't chase fame. and i seen you before and you're all the same.
"just one more mouth talkin' words insane. just one more mistake, with different names!"
don't question my heart! don't question the fire that burns inside!
don't question my heart! don't question a heart prepare to fight!
i heard you're lookin' for me... i'm standin' here. still standin' here.
i'm standin' here! still standin' here!
don't question my heart! don't question the fire that burns inside!
don't question my heart! don't question a heart prepare to fight!

(born) into the moment that is forever -
to breath until that fateful day
"day of wrath, day of burning - all the"
world to ashes turning...
on…and on
born in a mining town in ‘58
when black and white t.v. was up to date
and men were still around
"who fought for freedom, stood their ground and died"
that i could be alive and see
the damage that we've managed since
in this sceptred isle
"is nothing sacred, just the one square mile"
justice and liberty
"you can buy, but you don't get free"
in a world of steel and glass
we bury our past
"on and on, we slept till dawn"
"when we awoke, we hardly spoke"
my grandfather taught me how to fight
old fashioned stuff like wrong and right
but all around i see his morals
buried in a mess of money troubles
born in a mining town in ‘58
when black and white t.v. was up to date
and men were still around

were wolf in the night life
you won't believe your eyes
blonde hair in the red light
"she's getting down, getting down"
she'll never turn me down
put another stake into my heart
there's evil in her eyes
i cheated death and i come back alive
"die and rise, and take a bite of life"
"die and rise, with no regrets"
"die, die"
black queen in the mirror
she's putting me aside
one dose of the white light
"i'm shutting out, shutting out"
i wanna to make up
in the middle of a perfect dream
adrenaline inside
i cheated death and i come back alive
"die and rise, and take a bite of life"
"die and rise, with no regrets"
"die, die"
risorgerò in ogni momento poi che so
che la vita si tramuterà (x5)
"die and rise, and take a bite of life"

seize this regal day
your time has come
reach for the crown

fortune and glory and triumphs to be
look through these king's eyes
what do they tell?
your desire will never be killed
there's a certain feeling you get
at the moment you know you're the one
that sets the course of your own destiny

look through these king's eyes
what do you see?
fortune and glory and triumphs to be
look through these king's eyes
what do they tell?
your desire will never be killed
fatal warning
stop everything
too late to see
then you feel the moment of darkness
that’s when you forget
everything they said
then you’re headed back to the fortress
hard to define
the past has denied
serving as a grim reminder
the way it went down
came back around
what we thought was behind us
you know it’s a fatal warning
wouldn’t believe what you would find there
you know it’s a war they started
over the seas of regrets
when you brought me down through the fire
opened up my mind to desire
all the things i learned to rely on
all the dreams i left here to fine
are now gone
nothing to see
obvious to me
then you feel the moment’s upon you
could they conceive
what’s come to be
now you rest in solitude
met your demise to their delight
so many souls forsaken
could not believe
what the end will bring
can’t repay what’s been taken
you know it’s a fatal warning
wouldn’t believe what you would find there
you know it’s a war they started
over the seas of regrets
when you brought me down through the fire
opened up my mind to desire
all the things i expect to depend on
all the dreams about to descend
are now gone
all of your life
you idolized them
those men with pride
want to be like them
never alone
all parts of a team
no course of their own
it sounds like a dream
soldier
you're not worth a damn
take orders - is all that you can
obey'em
they'll teach you ev'ry rule
bombfood - you're nothing but a tool
made up your mind
the papers were signed
recruited and paid
for wastin' your time
the sweat and the blood
a price you must pay
work for your country
with nothing to say
the sergeant commands
to act like a rock
you had to admit
you ran out of luck
it's not out of lust
it's not even need
one thing's for sure
rocks don't bleed
grenades are hammering down on your head
"you lie in your hole, you wish were dead"
your partner lies splattered all over the place
there's no recognition he once had a face
you want you had stayed at home with your mum
but you are out here equipped with a gun
you're feelin' so helpless but what can you do
"'cause you volunteered, the blame is on you"
"out in the fields, where battles are fought"
"as ordered above, not one human thought"
"you sit in your hole, just waiting for death"
"the enemy cause, an eternal threat"
"why don't you go home, why don't you just leave?"
why not work for things in which you believe?
"the orders you take, won't do you no good"
"so why don't you split, you ain't nothin' but bombfood!"
overtake me -- seize
the vision through my eyes
and reinstate me --
bathe me in your sunlight
until i know -- until i know
constant motion -- kept me standing still
howling silence -- penetrate
and break my will
so re-embrace me -- the release
me one more time
until i know -- until i know
so re-embrace me -- the release
me one more time
until i know -- until i know
there is something weird i wouldn't believe
i'm losing grip on my lifetime
i don't understand this wave i'm in
"wrong place, no money, just responsibilities"
my heart and my wish are so far away
i'm alone now
feeling the slow beat turning fast
no longer breathing
i'm returning in my own hell
i don't want to go
hold me into your arms so tight
you cannot see
you'll see it
in another world
hold me into your arms so tight
you cannot see it
you'll see
there is something strange
you've got to believe
it's taking away my sunshine
i don't understand this wave i'm in
"she walks under the moon, into the valley of fire"
astral queen is dynamite
from this land of madness - she possesses the key
"a pyramid shape controls the ocean waves,"
she sails the seas of celestial grace
"where the blind man wanders, her darkness carries the light"
"soul and mind lost in her deep space,"
her magic power has a hold - oh so strange
"blue queen of cosmic beauty sanctions all the pain,"
mans loveless world has frozen - trapped in her domain
in the darkness of an endless night
at the dawn of eternal life
in the coldness of a land without sun
our spirits dive in the world of silence
farther into infinity
beyond the nothingness
atrocious vision of death
indescribable horror of darkness
desolation of absolute emptyness
unbearable sensation of impotence
we're dazzled by total obscurity of the parallel world
our senses are numb for our longest journey
"- master speak, we're listening!"
"- father order, we'll obey!"
we're all one
"at the age of 13 i signed my first deal,"
little did i know what that meant
my father told me to never let any of this get to my head
"at the age of 16 i was higher than the stars,"
i thought i was living the life
caught up in the mess i almost forgot the most important thing
"my family, the heartening"
all i can say is i'm sorry
my mother said chase your dreams
"my father taught me to believe, in love through thick and thin"
my brothers took my attitude
i'll be there with gratitude (gratitude)
and love through thick and thin
now at the age of 19 i take a look back and see all my mistakes
and the biggest one of all is not being there when you needed me
all i can do now is set the blood on fire for you every day
i'll make up for every single thing i'll be here for you until the end
"my family, the heartening"
i'll promise i will be here
my mother said chase your dreams
"my father taught me to believe, in love through thick and thin"
my brothers took my attitude
i'll be there with gratitude (gratitude)
and love through thick and thin
"father, i'll always remember the world with you by my side"
"and father, your always be my hero, oh oh"
"and mother, 'nada se compara con tu amor' oh oh, oh oh, oh oh"
"and brothers the two of you are my life and soul, oh"
"my family, the heartening"
i'll promise i will be here
my mother said chase your dream
my father taught me to believe in love through the thick and thin
my brothers took my attitude
i'll be there with gratitude (gratitude)
and love through thick and thin
and love through thick and thin
love through thick and thin

i decided to come here
to tell you what i never could!
"in the end we´re not the same,"
i´m tired of being misunderstood
all i need is to break free
like my spirit used to be
too many nights
i thought of you
but now there´s nothing i can do...
forgive me but i´ll say the truth:
it´s time to face the end!
what goes around
"comes around back to you,"
forgive me but i´ll say the truth...
"see the scars deep in your face,"
feel the thorns around your heart
"all that´s gone now stays behind,"
there´s no need to fall apart
all i want is to run free
with no shadows over me
so far away
though standing near
i know these words are hard to hear!
forgive me but i´ll say the truth:
it´s time to free the end!
what goes around
"comes around straight to you,"
forgive me but i´ll say the truth...
would you pledge absolution to me now?
will you throw away your armour?
or will it go on and on with you?
forgive me but i´ll say the truth...
forgive me but i´ll say it
there´s nothing left to stop me
forgive me but i´m over you!
disintegration constituents to decompose of the parts (of the parts)

we are the deceived (deceived)
lost in the foreseen (lost in the foreseen)
we are the deceived (deceived)
lost in the foreseen (lost in the foreseen)
to wait for aforementioned dreams time will only tell
tell that the promised have been failed
behold your fellow man through centuries of control
adhering to the decrees of a manufactured god
dark world will be invisible for you no more
demons will show their faces
"the time is calling you, shut the ?allic? hall"
demons will show their creations
it's not someone else's fight
only you can make it right
"don't look away, you life is right here"
you have been walking through life
with your eyes closed
you need to stop the fall
this is you wake up call
escaping from yourself
will not wander ?alone?
need to see it all
this is your wake up call
wake up!
"get up no more, this is were you can't hide"
the evil spirits will find you
it's not someone else's fight
only you can make it right
"don't look away, you life is right here"
you have been walking through life
with your eyes closed
you need to stop the fall
this is you wake up call
escaping from yourself
will not wander ?alone?
need to see it all
this is your wake up call
solo
it's not someone else's fight
only you can make it right
"don't look away, you life is right here"
you have been walking through life
with your eyes closed
you need to stop the fall
this is you wake up call
escaping from yourself
will not wander ?alone?
need to see it all
this is your wake up call
oh you need to wake up!
this is your wake up call!
"dried, rotting, flaking, rancid flesh"
crumbling tissue - nothing left
"cancerous, mouldy, septic infestation"
smouldering decay of defecation
your bowels now play host to pestilent decay
"waiting dormantly, it knows you're easy prey"
"see the corpse, smell the rot"
rigor mortis sets in like a frost
"lacerated arteries, entrails in a mess"
"the dry, stale smell of long rotted flesh"
"see the corpse, smell the warmth"
"as its cold, grey insides fester and burn"
"the guts may melt, but the torso remains"
as the jellified innards turn into methane
the looking glass
gabriel:
drawn by the sound of that wild raving pound
no one has told me
i gotta know all about hell and below
they never told me
the quest for nexus
in your life and for all that's beyond...
gabriel:
when i gaze at the man who is gazing at me
when i stare into the looking glass
when i ask what he sees
then i'm asking for more and the more that i wanna know
i know what i'll never know
tree of knowledge:
"from far away, from the state of decay"
you've come to wisdom
"many've been led, into madness instead"
toll of my kingdom
the quest for nexus has brought
many men of genius to insanity
gabriel:
when i gaze at the man who is gazing at me
when i stare into the looking glass
when i ask what he sees
tree of knowledge:
"then you're asking for more, and the more that"
you wanna know
you know what you'll never know
tree of knowledge:
as long as you long for the whole
you can't get a part of at all
how proud would the buildings of rome
look without a single stone
gabriel:
when i gaze at the man who is gazing at me
when i stare into the looking glass
when i ask what he sees
then i'm asking for more and the more
that i wanna know
i know what i'll never know...
as i drift away...
"far away from you,"
"i feel all alone in a crowded room,"
thinking to myself
"""there's no escape from this"
fear
regret
"loneliness... """
visions of love and hate
a collage behind my eyes
remnants of dying laughter
echoes of silent cries
i wish i didn't know now what
i never knew then...
flashback
memories punish me once again.
sometimes i remember all the pain
that i have seen.
sometimes i wonder
what might have been...
visions of love and hate
a collage behind my eyes
remnants of dying laughter
echoes os silent cries
and sometimes i despair
at who i've become
i have to come to terms
with what i've done
the bittersweet taste of fate
we can't outrun the past
destined to find an answer
a strength i never lost
"i know there is a way,"
"my future is not set,"
for the tide has turned
but still i never learned to live
without regret.
[judas priest cover]
i've been trying
there's no denying
it's sending me
out of my mind
i've seen reason
change to treason
it's losing it's sense
of all kind
how much longer will it take
for the world to see
we should learn to live
and simply let it be
"bloodstone, bloodstone"
in the night time
wake in fright
i'm so scared of the game
that's being played
start to wonder
what's going under
and how many deals
have been made
how much longer will it take
for the world to see
we should learn to live
and simply let it be
"bloodstone, bloodstone"
bloodstone
i can't take it
you got me living
on a bloodstone
i don't want that bloodstone
the shadows are thick and old
i'm searching the dark for my love
behind the theater of puppet shows
i find the stairs to the cellar below
hiding where the shadows rule
a door opens below
the moon is high above
"300 pounds of flesh, that woman i know"
oh it's the puppet master's wife
she pulls a cart behind her
"""oh emerencia"", where are you going with that knife?"
[solo: mike]
"time to kill, it's time for her nightly thrill"
"""oh emerencia"", where are you going with that knife?"
deep in the night through the narrowest streets
i follow her every step
she is searching for innocent victims
"""oh emerencia"""
in an alley a homeless is sleeping
approaching without a sound...and then...oh no
"""how strange it is.. to see.. a life that slips away"
"how strange it is.. in darkness blood is black not red"""
[solo: andy]
the knife is still deep in his chest
gotta keep the blood in its nest
she wraps him in the sack she brought
she better leave before she gets caught
through the streets dark and old
"through the streets, no one must know"
only the moon and i
and none of us will ever tell
she pulls the body off the cart
"back at the theater, down into the dark"
"""oh emerencia"", i wonder why you left the door ajar"
[solo: andy]
deep in the night through the narrowest hallways
i follow her every step
there's a light from a doorway ahead of us
"where did she go, where did she go...? oh no"
was there ever a time that you could defy
tell me was there ever a time
that you could refine
what was boiling deep inside you
what was building up inside you
well what do you do when none of it's true?
you gonna go break the mirror
you thought was you?
while it's coming down around you
it's all falling down around you
if i took away your one excuse
helped you down and cut the noose
would you leave it all behind you?
could you leave this all behind you?
if you tore away the tourniquet
and you put yourself in front of it
could you leave this all behind you?
would you leave this all behind you?
tell me was there ever a way
ever a day you could have simply walked away
or talked your way out of
what was changing deep inside you?
rearranging what's inside you?
while you're looking around
for someone to blame
i hear that you'd been running around
dropping my name?
while the ship you're on is sinking
what the fuck have you been thinking?
if i took away your one excuse
helped you down and cut the noose
would you leave it all behind you?
could you leave this all behind you?
if you tore away the tourniquet
and you put yourself in front of it
could you leave this all behind you?
would you leave this all behind you?
if i took away your one excuse
helped you down and cut the noose
would you leave it all behind you?
could you leave this all behind you?
if you tore away the tourniquet
and you put yourself in front of it
could you leave this all behind you?
would you leave this all behind you?
if i took away your one excuse
helped you down and cut the noose
would you leave it all behind you?
could you leave this all behind you?
if you tore away the tourniquet
and you put yourself in front of it
could you leave this all behind you?
would you leave this all behind you?
take it down easy
take it down low
slide it to the bottom
and shake it real slow
now move it to the side
and squeeze it real tight
is there any wonder
i'm losing my sight
get me to the doctor
i gotta get a shot
i just can't get enough of you (*)
i do anything that you want me to
"i just can't get enough of you, oh no"
i just can't get enough of you
i do anything that you want me to
i just can't get enough of you tonight
oh no!
gotta swing it to the front
slide it to the back
grind it real slow
i like it like that
now turn it round good
stroke it down bad
you're giving me a feeling
that i've never had
get me to the doctor
i'm running too hot
(repeat *)
let me down easy
let me down slow
hold me down tight
and never let go
get me to a doctor
i got it real bad
lying on the table dead
coroner
completes his task
examining the wretched stiff
suicide
the likely cause
behind closed doors the change
begins
then it grows
mutilation of the cadaver
mutilation of the cadaver
coroner returns to notice
subtle change
how can this be?
must be his imagination
the man's been dead
for several days
the change continues after hours
different face
mutilation of the cadaver
soon the corpse will change its shape
who is it?
mutilation of the cadaver
mutilation of the cadaver
mutilation of the cadaver
mutilation of the cadaver
the coroner returns and sees
the body has truly changed
the corpse has stolen his face
and now he loses his mind
[solo: pat]
[solo: jack]
shocking evolution
mutilation of the cadaver
hideous conversion
mutilation of the cadaver
postmortem upheaval
mutilation of the cadaver
awful transformation
mutilation of the cadaver
gruesome reconstruction
mutilation of the cadaver

the worst form of illness is one that goes undiagnosed
subtle decay secretly spread a cancer of the soul
"a cancer, a cancer of the soul"
we are all dying‚ some of us just faster than our friends
but pointing to a greater fault won't cure what we have hidden
i used to be able to pretend
but i can no longer hide from who i am
my deceit was displayed for all to see
the only thing that could've saved me
only after we've fallen
can we then find the cure
looking up from the bottom
when dust settles‚ it's clear
"when the dust settles, it's clear"
it's so easy to believe that you are nothing like me
'cause your deceit is lesser and yet to be seen
but doesn't that change what you're hiding?
only after we've fallen
can we find the cure
looking up from the bottom
"when dust settles, it's clear"
only after we've fallen
can we then find the cure
looking up from the bottom
when dust settles‚ it's clear
only after we've fallen
can we then find cure
we are all dying
a cancer of the soul
we are all dying
a cancer of the soul
a heart that is bound by snakes
with a mind that sprouting wings
a dangerous combination that fails to address our infection
my deceit was displayed for all to see
the only thing that could have saved me
only after we've fallen
can we then find the cure
looking up from the bottom
"when dust settles, it's clear"
only after we've fallen
can we then find the cure
looking up from the bottom
"when dust settles, it's clear"
only after we've fallen
we are all dying
but will we find the cure?
only after we have fallen
looking up from the bottom
it seems so clear
one thing that i got for you
is the one thing that you never do
one thing makes you feel brand new
is the one thing that you're coming to
just the one thing gets you in the mood
you call my number in the middle of the night
to tell me nothing else can make you feel alright
"but it rings, you hang it up, and call me back again"
one thing that i got for you
is the one thing that you never do
one thing that you've got to choose
is the one thing you can never lose
just the one thing that fits your attitude
you call my name in the middle of the night
when you're making love and it feels alright
"but it's him, not me, can't you see, a shot of reality"
"i know what you're doing, i know what you're doing"
"i know what you want, i know what you wanted to do"
"i know when the lights go out, i know when the lights go out"
one thing that i got for you
is the one thing you never do
just the one thing that gets you in the mood
just the one thing that fits your attitude
one thing is scorning pain
just the one thing.

selling wrong for right enlarging their file
"boneheaded games, triumph of sin"
"black gold, stuck to their veins"
"black gold, they're running insane"
"black gold, blood on their hands"
"black gold, life's got no chance"
black gold
raking in money the evil to praise
licking its honey hellfire to face
[pre]
"black gold, goes up in smoke"
"black gold, children to choke"
black gold
[music & lyrics by p.wagner]
i've been waiting for an invitation
couldn't leave my selfmade reservation
i had locked the doors and threw the key away
there was nothing but my own reflection
"and the phone was silent, no connection"
i was turning just in circles with no end
"all that i had, it was gone, it was dead"
but now my night is surrounded by light
"this nust be a sign of heaven, a sign of heaven"
the nightmare's over
as the winter left the frozen places
and the mirror smiled at lonely face
the my leaves they started slowly reached out
now your laughter echoes in the silence
and your waters wash the dirt from my hands
as we harvest all the fruits that come our way
"all that i had, it was gone, it was dead"
but now my night is surrounded by light
"this nust be a sign of heaven, a sign of heaven"
the nightmare's over
there was nothing but my own reflection
"death march, death march"
"death march, death march"
this is a new world order and it's changing the game
so step right up to go down in flames
"i want your sons, want your daughters"
all creatures of the night
so wave your flag if you're ready to fight
bringing insects to their knees
catching them in webs i've weaved
you were in my dream last night
begging me to take a bite
i indulge the hypocrisy and i devour the pain
i give into the ecstasy but the cold dark remains
i control my own destiny and i won't suffer in vain
"my enemy will not be the end of me, no no"
"death march, no, that's not how i go"
"death march, let everyone know"
"this is the new disorder, it's the unsolved case"
and it's bringing the rage straight to your face
"so send in the clowns, add fuel to the fire"
they cut your throat just to preach to the choir
all is fair in love and war
i'm still rotten to the core
so won't somebody start this shit?
"fuck 'em all, i'm over it"
i indulge the hypocrisy and i devour the pain
i give into the ecstasy but the cold dark remains
i control my own destiny and i won't suffer in vain
my enemy will not be the end of me
it's chaos up in my head
my demons are my best friends
"ashes, ashes, we all fall down"
there's just hate in the hole where my heart used to be
there's just hate in the hole where my heart used to be
i want you and you and you and you
i indulge the hypocrisy and i devour the pain
i give into the ecstasy but the cold dark remains
i control my own destiny and i won't suffer in vain
my enemy will not be the end of me
"death march, no, that's not how i go"
"death march, let everyone know"
walking down the path that lead me to my memories
passing all the way without a care in my stride
where are the friends of my yesterday
have they moved on with their lives
can we still laugh and joke about things like before
there´s no need to hide the past that i have left behind
it´s a good resource somewhere for me to find
why am i waiting for someone to reach out
it shouldn´t be all up to them
keeping in touch ain´t that easy but i´ll have to try
where have all the years gone
that´s what i am asking now
what have i learned so far
tell me father time - tell me now
now i understand i´ll take from time what i need
and i store it inside it´s there for me to find
i can´t deny that the years will pass by
but it won´t bother me
'cuz now i will set out to realize my dream
where have all the years gone
that´s what i am asking now
what have i learned so far
tell me father time - tell me now
"cupboard's bare, i'm so hungry"
"life ain't fair, gimme some money"
"macaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack"
"i love, i love, i love, i love:"
kraf dinner
"boiling water, i can't wait"
"it's getting hotter, it feels so great"
"macaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack"
"well that was fun, but now that i'm all done"
"now sedate, i think i'll buy a crate"
"macaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack"
kraf dinner
dinner
kraf dinner
my dinner
i want it now
time goes by
but you can't rest
too many things
and you're obsessed
trying to find
some sense to it all
no-one knows what you've been through
like no-one cares
but it's not true
turn the pages
and make a fresh start
when you are low
you should known
you are not the only lonely soul
and you will find
the strength inside
there is no more need to hide
just carry on
fullfill your dreams
don't let them try to pull you down
just carry on
and reach your goals
don't cry
don't give up
march on till the end
the road is long but you'll reach the final bend
his mind is worn and so tortured
suffering was part of the plan
blades flying swift with justice
remember the idea not the man
rising up from the fire
unified to be free
stoking our fears with their lies
you are the key
sedated they kept us all dormant
"unknowing, our lives lived in vain"
like mindless drones we're devoted
we’ve welcomed our fate as their slaves
prepare for victory
our minds have been awakened
rid your life of tyranny
we are the resistance
"no fear, stand tall"
resist
tyranny falls
"no lives, no war"
resist
victory calls
rising up from the fire
unified to be free
stoking our fears with their lies
you are the key
in the end we were coiled with the serpent
it took all we had to break free
"our victory, it came without violence"
"we vanquished, they fell to their knees"
prepare for victory
our minds have been awakened
rid your life of tyranny
we are the resistance
"no fear, stand tall"
resist
tyranny falls
"no lives, no war"
resist
victory calls

"well, i'm here... i did it!"
destiny fulfilled.
this quest stripped out of me
all i had...
"so embrace me, please, i insist..."
hold this new born being that is me.
"old lake, new ground"
"before the past, beyond now"
"old wind, new found way to blow..."
time and time again
things kept falling down
all that blood i gave
never brought me anything more than hate...
what has left of me is all yours now!
"old lake, new ground"
"before the past, beyond now"
"old wind, new found way to blow..."
yeah!!
"old lake, new ground"
"where we're standing still, it's not now"
"sign, sealed and delivered"
no more than a leaf trying
to resist the breeze's sweeping...
from the stone to diamond!
"old lake, new ground"
"before the past, beyond now"
"old wind, new found..."
"where we're standing still, it's not now"
"sign, sealed and delivered"
the reverberations
escape and embrace me to a lonely sleep
as thoughts hold on to me
with words left unspoken
i couldn't ease the pain so easily
drown my sanity
"the distance apart, the longing in our hearts"
i will remain until the day i die
we keep this path alive
never break the ties
i will remain until the day i die
the open spaces
another city passes as we sleep
and it calls to me
the rhythm tears me open
another crowd
another chance to bleed
through this release
"the distance apart, the longing in our hearts"
i will remain until the day i die
we keep this path alive
never break the ties
i will remain until the day i die
and i taste the pain
no looking back
as it begins again
i wouldn't change a thing
i'll give it everything
until the end
until my final breath
i will hold fast
never turning back
i will hold fast
until the day i die
(forever i will remain)
"the distance apart, the longing in our hearts"
i will remain until the day i die
we keep this path alive
never break the ties
i will remain until the day i
until the day i die
as i sit here and slowly close my eyes
i take another deep breath
and feel the wind pass through my body
i'm the one in your soul
reflecting the light
protect the ones who hold you
cradling your inner child
i need serenity
in a place where i can hide
i need serenity
"nothing changes, days go by"
where do we go when we just don't know
and how do we relight the flame when it's cold
why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
and when will we learn to control
tragic visions slowly stole my life
tore away everything
cheating me out of my time
i'm the one who loves you
no matter wrong or right
and every day i hold you
i hold you with my inner child
i need serenity
in a place where i can hide
i need serenity
"nothing changes, days go by"
where do we go when we just don't know
and how do we relight the flame when it's cold
why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
and when will we learn to control
where do we go when we just don't know
and how do we relight the flame when it's cold
why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
and when will we learn to control
i need serenity [x4]
tell the world we'll lose our future any time
this will be a rude awakening if we don't stop now
everywhere we see the atomic threat will be
"handled by the bad, the deceivers that gone mad"
lead us into death
"to hell and back, we're"
on the edge of darkness
never return
on the edge of darkness
when the nuclear dictators ride the bomb
"hell is here to stay forever, do you want it so"
instability killing the economy
continents in war throwing horror on the poor
mother nature dies
"to hell and back, we're"
on the edge of darkness
never return
on the edge of darkness
when will we learn
"pull your head out of the sand, you need to know"
"your ass, it will burn red hot, right when it all explodes"
everywhere it seems all those people lost their dreams
"everyone's insane, all the warning was in vain"
blinded 'till we're dead
"to hell and back, we're"
"when will we learn, will we ever learn"
yeah
this television has a poison on its breath.
this counter culture of both wicked lies and death.
it makes my eyes bleed everytime i turn around.
how will they all feel when i bring them to the ground?
and i'll say.
i walk for miles inside this pit of danger.
"a place where no one follows me, i walk alone."
huh!
i'm sick of all these people talkin' out their heads
i've never understood a damn thing that they said
from words to actions never knowing what they're about
i guess i'll have to chew them off and spit them out
and i'll say
i walked for miles inside this pit of danger
i've swallowed down a thousand years of anger
the weight of the world is falling on my shoulders
"a place where no one follows me, i walk alone"
yeah
i walk alone
oh yeah
yeah
i walked for miles inside this pit of danger
i've swallowed down a thousand years of anger
the weight of the world is falling on my shoulders
"a place where no one follows me, i walk alone"
i walk alone
yeah
all for one
primal fear
composição: indisponível
"hold back the night, my darkest dreams"
i'm standing right beside you - enemy
"i'll take your fate, into this world"
and i will follow you into the dawn
"i will unbind your chains, release you to reality"
"the army of the dead, will rise again - alive again"
look into the unknown mirror
see the face that burns the land
eye to eye with this evil monster - hand in hand
take your brave heart in a fighting moment
anger rises everywhere
lost leaders give us hope and wake up the dead
"high spirits and emotions, are coming back to us"
"the oppression takes too long, we've lost everything"
"the eyes are turning black, the fighting spirits back"
"we raise our hands in faith, the day of reckoning"
we have a chance
and we're holding back the moment
when the morning comes
the battle will be won
one dream - one heart
we're all for one
we fight for our destiny
one dream - one heart
we're all for one
we're living in our agony
all for one
(solo)
we have a chance
and we're holding back the moment
when the morning comes
the battle will be won
one dream - one heart
we're all for one
we fight for our destiny
one dream - one heart
we're all for one
we're living in our agony
all for one
one dream - one heart
we're all for one
we fight for our destiny
one dream - one heart
we're all for one
we're living in our agony
all for one
all for one
all for one
all for one
all for one
in the days of confusion
mankind creates their own gods.
they fear the opposition.
they fear the truth
but only one word makes them freeze to the bone:
fear the antichrist!!
(lyrics: j. rechberger)
(music: t. koivusaari & e. holopainen)
"terror, when the darkness binds your limbs"
"terror, when the fear freezes your nerves"
"horror, when the pain climbs up your veins"
"darkness, creeping under you skin"
"moment of life,"
"when we all have to choose,"
which way to go
and for whom to sacrifice your life
invoke the god - pray
to lead you back to life - pray
cursed by religion - hate
learned upon church - fake
"in the verge of hell,"
of human mind
"redemption of your soul,"
as darkness binds you tight
"moment of life,"
"when we all have to choose,"
which way to go
and for whom to sacrifice your life
waters' running down
by the silver moonrays -
towards the foundation
reflecting themselves
and creating deadly forms ov life

where the sigil branded
"on the breast, for'head"
and temple ov atlantis
rise we upon the ladder
ov blasphemies
towering o'er the heavens
where our empty laugh rings
and fingers touch the face
are you waiting on something profound in your life?
something to touch your core?
making up for what seems millions of years
"reaping the goods, but not sure"
"come along, come along"
can you see there's more?
not just defeat vain attempts to do things right
more than the toil to endure each day
or the ache you forget and leave behind
if creatures roamed the space in heaven
"they're angels, beasts, or supermen"
do they ease attaining things
no one believed you'd achieve?
so once you may ascend to heaven
someone there has made it so
you could be the one they've been waiting for
still running about seeking sense in your life
what you couldn't make count before
taking much of your time is grieving about things
"well, you could care less, what's that for"
"come along, come along"
can you see there's more?
not just defeat vain attempts to do things right
more than the toil to endure each day
or the ache you forget and leave behind
"come along, come along"
can you see there's more?
not just defeat vain attempts to do things right
more than the toil to endure each day
or the ache you forget and leave behind
if creatures roamed the space in heaven
"they're angels, beasts, or supermen"
do they ease attaining things
no one believed you'd achieve?
so once you may ascend to heaven
someone there has made it so
you could be the one they've been waiting for
"i'm on the run, but i don't know"
"what is the scare, so there's no way to go"
what do i fear to cross my way
it's gonna come like a kick in the a...
"father you've warned me, so i should have known"
something's not right
"set the alarm now, before it's too late"
make it allright
all i want is my own integrity
all i want is a chance of being free
it could be heaven on earth if we are one
all i want is to end what i've begun
that's all i want
it's getting hard to understand
what is the right thing and what's a dead end
don't wanna live like in disgrace
'cause in the end it's a kick in the face
you tread on me and you give me the blame
this is not right
"don't mean to harm you, so treat me the same"
then it's allright
all i want is my own integrity
all i want is a chance of being free
it could be heaven on earth if we are one
all i want is to end what i've begun
i will stand and fight to justify you.
you have bled and died to justify me.
force me down into hate.
your freedom will stop when i can't breath.
i'm taking the path that i don't need.
i'm taking the place so it won't bleed.
broken out and turned away.
burned to the ground and change the face.
bled to death and turned to gray.
resurrect again to say.
"i made my promise, and now i've fallen."
through broken pieces i set you.
i will stand and fight to justify you.
you have bled and died to justify me.
let me see it all die in front of myself so i can't lie.
a hollow design for the new side.
exterior death for the old side.
this is the end of the last time.
bury the old and say the name.
break the mold and new remain.
resurrect again to say.
"i made my promise, and now i've fallen."
through broken pieces i see you.
i will stand and fight to justify you.
you have bled and died to justify me.
"a lifeless body, a broken soul."
"i fall to zero, i've lost control."
"i've lost control, i will stand and fight to justify you."
you have bled and died to justify me.
the night's riding in as the lights go down
"it's time, heed the call"
psyched up expectations erupting in us all
"playing to win, now let the madness begin"
templars of the world
victorious immortals
thunder up your souls

night will come and i will follow
"for my victims, no tomorrow"
"make it fast, your time of sorrow"
"on his trail, i'll make you follow"
quarters for the criminally insane
the sentence read for life i must remain
the path i chose has led me to my grave
to try again i'd have no other way
quarters for the criminally insane
escape for me has fast become a game
"soon to be, i'll leave without a trace"
endangered species end the human race
"(lead: hanneman, king)"
branded in pain
marked criminally insane
locked away and kept restrained
"disapprobation, but what have i done"
i have yet only just begun
to take your fuckin' lives!
[night will come and i will follow
"for my victims, no tomorrow"
"make it fast, your time of sorrow"
"on his trail, i'll make you follow]"
now you see all this time
work nine to five
monday thru friday i'm singing
i sing the blues for you
now i'm standing in the pouring rain
my feet are cold but i cant complain
and i wonder how you have been
i need you love i miss you so
i know it's right but it's always strange
how i scream
all this life's worth all the while
heartache and slave driving pain
i sing the blues for you
now im standing in the pouring rain
my feet are cold but i can't complain
and i wonder how you have been
i need you love i miss you so
i know it's right but it's always strange
"whether he the quaint savant's power doth hold i know not,"
albeit ætat a thousand stars' birth he is -
quoth i that for reasons to me oblivious
"august of a granditude of servants is he held,"
and by plastic consonantry e'en more servants to the host addéd are -
"pelf they are, dare i say!"
maugre his diurnal seraphic deviltry
i say that deviltry - 'tis forsooth deviltry! -
mind not this in scintillating shades clad is;
to claim the glore is he suffer'd.
"«grant me the fatlings», qouth he, «the fatter the better!»,"
and died they of starvation;
they are not slaughtering their fatlings -
they are slaughtering 'hemselves.
"sith i at time of yester the questions durst ask,"
"and dare i say this burthen weightful was,"
"wrack of his machine-like motion was i naméd,"
tho' blind and fond the jesters rebuilt
the machine alike - yet whettéd and dight are its edges...
been down this road too many times
you taught me how it feels to die
we learn what it feels like
to feel pain for the first time
we learn what it feels like
to suffer
give me the strength
to face what's in front of you
in front of me
by any lenght
to face what's in front of you
in front of me
i watch it fall before my eyes
this dream we've built for our
whole lives
we learn what it feels like
to feel pain for the first time
we learn what it feels like
to suffer
give me the strength
to face what's in front of you
in front of me
by any lenght
to face what's in front of you
in front of me
"vanquish that which kills you, darling"
forsake not the dream
"through the world, i feel i'm falling"
forsake not the dream
crest fall in
on the crestfallen
collide
and collapse
crest fall in
on the crestfallen
collide
and collapse
give me the strength
to face what's in front of you
in front of me
by any lenght
to face what's in front of you
in front of me
"vanquish that which kills you, darling"
forsake not the dream
"through the world, i feel i'm falling"
forsake not the dream
forsake

you can't stop them.
"what do you think, we just go on forever?"""

is born in that night

so what can we do with our lives
when it all begins
it's hard and it's cruel
will grace die in pain? will light ever rise again?
"oh, i'm trapped in darkness"
still i reach out for the stars
i'm moving in silence
i leave it all far behind
oh at dawn
i'll face the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll pray at the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll face the edge of thorns
let us march on
"to the fields of sacrifice, wondering why"
i'll carry on
will i betray myself to rise
in the silence
it's time to explain
search for truth in lies
useful lies
needless love's damned
what can we do with our lives
when it all begins
come follow me
and you will see
how it will be
when all the pain is gone away
oh at dawn
i'll pray at the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll face the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll pray at the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll face the edge of thorns
let us march on
though there's no hope at our side
let us be brave
though by glory we are denied
but don't you think
it's time for us
to bring to an end
come play the song of death
the wisdom in us both
will make it
special guaranteed
come play the song of death
i'm lost in the depth of his eyes i can't flee
inner pain caused insanity
it's deep within
the fear and the hunger
enslaved and denied by my love and my enemies
i'm the illgotten
so-o-o-oooo-o-o-oooon
oh at dawn
i'll face the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll pray at the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll face the edge of thorns
we skipped the light fandango
and turned cartwheels across the floor
"yeah, i was feeling kind of seasick"
"but the crowd called out for more, yeah, oh yeah"
and the room was humming harder
and as the ceiling flew away
"we called out for another drink, oh yeah"
the waiter brought the tray
"and so it was that later, yeah"
as the miller told his tale
that her face at first just ghostly
turned a whiter shade of pale
she said there is no reason
and the truth is plain to see
but i wandered through my playing cards
"and i would not let her be, oh, oh yeah"
one of sixteen vestal virgins
who were leaving for the coast
"and oh, and my eyes were open"
they might just as well have been closed
"and so it was that later, oh"
as the miller told his tale
that her face at first just ghostly
"turned a whiter shade of pale, oh yeah"
"oh, and so it was, yeah, oh later"
the miller told his tale
yeah her face was kinda ghostly
"turned a whiter shade of pale, oh yeah"

"not for a day, not for a while"
"you're all alone, you're never satisfied"
"oh, you've been dreaming for a hundred years"
so you began to understand
that your lifetime is running
through your hands
who will forgive you for this trail of tears?
there you go on
"someone to love, easy to find"
fulfill your heart with blood of any kind
unlink the chain before it strangles you
there you go
hearing voices and noises again
there you stand
back in time where it all once began
"there you are, in vain"
"after a shock, time to recompose"
an old bleeding heart
so mistreated and abused
who will forgive you for this trail of tears?
there you go
hearing voices and noises again
there you stand
back in time where it all once began
"there you are, my friend"
wings of desire
primal fear
composição: indisponível
i'm walking the thin line and i realize
there is only one way to go
a one way street back to hell
well i can't go on
cause the truth is mine
i could only wait
my heart beat's the rhythm of time
there's only one destiny
"watch me die again, i'm losing faith"
there is nobody holding the flame
feel the touch of the wing
feel the eagleheart
feel the look of his eyes
it takes me higher and higher
on the wings of desire
who's behind my eyes - who follow me
i'm fighting the pain
running on the edge of a dream
can i save myself
"at the end of the line, the end of the dream"
my soul escapes
come listen to my silent screams
in a dead end street
"watch me die again, take the demons from me"
will you visit my final hour
feel the touch of the wing
feel the eagleheart
feel the look of his eyes
it takes me higher and higher
on the wings of desire
no sign no light is leading my way
some minutes later
i'm back and awaiting the day
there's only a chance to turn
there's only a flame that burns on the wings of desire
"watch me die again, take the demons from me"
will you visit my final hour
feel the touch of the wing
feel the eagleheart
feel the look of his eyes
it takes me higher and higher
on the wings of desire
"far from here, a house forsaken on lands of yesterday"
the silence of the night has crept in
"as weeping of the women, as thoughts of solitude"
as sadness and as grief
in a dim deserted room a token left on the table
"a talisman, a hairbrush from his father"
oozing from the shaft a stream of bitter sap
"dripping scarlet flow, so slow"
they know it to be an emblem of death
a sign of destruction
they recognize the end of a friend
the agony of a man and son
"they look at brush, remember the black hair"
they weep the bitter sap
oozing from the shaft a stream of bitter sap
"dripping scarlet flow, so slow"
"bristles weeping wet, into a pool of red"
you can't kill me. i am living inside you.
i am a part of your existence
twisted thoughts in a twisted mind
provoking you
black is my heart - dark is my soul
my hatred i can not control
evil seed growing stronger
your freewill... dying!
inside you - heart of darkness
a part of you - heart of darkness
"to deny me, is to deny yourself."
the illusion is dissolved
you are no longer in control
the facade crumbles - the transition is complete
...the transition is complete
i come to you in the night
i am your dark subconscience
"i keep you awake, knowing"
i am the heart of darkness
frozen
lyrics and music by theatre of tragedy
cold and risen from the grave
hidden years will tell no tales
now you seek what only heart can see
frozen in so many ways
drifting through the light inside
a lucent image in the dark
fickle and dismayed
someone cast a shadow
blurring all the pictures on the pages
"hide the pieces, i become the sun"
"shining through, what became of you"
"early morning, no time to lose"
"chills my heart, and i come undone"
quiet timeless silhouette
forgotten fragments of my dreams
pleasure and disgust
shining golden figure in the background
"hide the pieces, i become the sun"
"shining through, what became of you"
"early morning, no time to lose"
"chills my heart, and i come undone"

i will rise up - over this
'till i come to a higher place
i will find strength - let go
of all the ties to my disgrace
i'm no more - and no less
than anyone else
looking for a new horizon
i can find in myself
(it's all right) the shadow's gone
(shine your light) with the risin' sun
(it's all right) take me as i am
(yeah yeah yeah) cuz here i stand
no hesitation - holdin' back
i'll take each step one by one
but i might fall - i could stray
if i loose my eye's today
i'm only one in a crowd
i'm just one voice on the line
looking for a new horizon
another place another time
(it's all right) the shadow's gone
(shine your light) with the risin' sun
(it's all right) take me as i am
(yeah yeah yeah) cuz here i stand
coda: in our hands a light shines
we still wonder
change our world into sand
we will hunger
like a child -fears the night-
draws near its mother
like a son -fears no one-
will cast our shadow forever
'cause here i stand
this your only grace.
"the art of conversation,"
regarding common sense.
"as merely an infliction,"
divided we stand
divided we stand
maybe you're content.
"relying on religion,"
you steal without consent.
"just consummates my theory,"
divided we stand
divided we stand
divided we'll stand.
regardless we'll fall.
"how subtle the words we've come to know,"
divided we stand.
determined to fall.
just like this hollow world that sleeps inside of me...
divided we stand

fifteen years in the academy
he was like no cadet they'd ever seen
"a man so hard, his veins bleed ice"
and when he speaks he never says it twice
"they call him judge, his last name is dredd"
"so break the law, and you wind up dead"
truth and justice are what he's fighting for
"judge dredd the man, he is the law"
drokk it!
with gun and bike he rules the streets
and every perp he meets will taste defeat
not even death can overcome his might
"cause dredd and anderson, they won the fight"
when the sov's started the apocalypse war
mega-city was bombed to the floor
"dredd resisted, and the judges fought back"
crushed the sov's with their counter-attack
drokk it!
respect the badge - he earned it with his blood
fear the gun - your sentence may be death because...
i am the law!
and you won't fuck around no more - i am the law
"i judge the rich, i judge the poor - i am the law"
commit a crime i'll lock the door - i am the law
because in mega-city... i am the law
in the cursed earth where mutants dwell
"there is no law, just a living hell"
anarchy and chaos as the blood runs red
but this would change if it was up to dredd
the book of law is the bible to him
and any crime committed is a sin
he keeps the peace with his law-giver
"judge, jury, and executioner"
drokk it!
crime - the ultimate sin
your iso-cube is waiting when he brings you in
law - it's what he stands for
crime's his only enemy and he's going to war
crime - the ultimate sin
your iso-cube is waiting when he brings you in
law - it's what he stands for
crime's his only enemy and he's going to war
i am the law!
and you won't fuck around no more - i am the law
"i judge the rich, i judge the poor - i am the law"
commit a crime i'll lock the door - yes i am the law
"because in mega-city... oh yes, i am the law"
"dwelling inside was an anger, an anger that grew into hatred"
"grinding, churning inside of me"
"seeking, finding the need to feed"
"on my soul, it now appears i've lost control"
"of my mind, it's now begun to tear and grind"
"the pain, its destination my brain"
can't hide from being eaten from inside - inside
"originating deep within, a heart that is now cold and dead"
"tearing its way through my organs, leaving nothing but shreds"
"ripping, tissue is torn away"
"severing, parts and veins in the way"
my insides are on the outside of me
my bones now shatter and explode
"the pain, its destination my brain"
can't hide from being eaten from inside
"left on the ground is my head, waiting for the final blow"
"brain violently corroding, the end won't come fast only slow"
seeing what's left of my body
"drowning, blood is surrounding me"
my skull melts revealing my brain
"exploding, my body's imploding"
"the pain, its destination my brain"
"how many tears must we cry before learning,"
"things that we have they're for real and we're losing,"
"can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away."
"why do you believe that we've got something coming,"
"you took it all, left me standing here with nothing,"
"can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away,"
too far away.
"in your world you must be dreaming, if you think you can survive,"
taking all and giving nothing that's a crime.
"what makes you something special, what about me, i'm here too,"
you don't care what i'm feeling and that's the truth.
"can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away."
"all i need is understanding and the right to survive,"
"only you could see the warnings, and pass them by."
"what makes you something special, what about me, i'm here too,"
you don't care what i'm feeling and that's the truth.
"can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away."
too far away.
"can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away."
"how many tears must we cry before learning,"
"things that we had they're for real and we're losing,"
"can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away."
"too far away, too far away, too far away."

what can i do when the sadness comes through?
i'd better stay asleep inside my bed
when every word could be causing a hurt
i'd better keep the silence than to speak
won't someone help me cause i just can't make my mind up to escape
"morning, another day"
still i'm fighting for a wink of sleep
the clock rings and i must begin
"but i feel so broken, i could weep"
and i find it hard to stay awake
just to make a step costs all my will
"i get no power from a shower, i"
wont' make it in an hour
"and my body's aching, am i ill?"
"oh, just let me out"
"i've tried so hard, i can't get out"
"i just can't get out, my state of"
mind won't let me out
daytime i'm coming round
and the first thing that i hear is bad
then i start to worry everyone around me
and i'm angry and i'm feeling sad
i'm screaming i am fighting with
the people that get in my way
i'm running and i'm pushing and
i'm crying and i'm crushing
my depression made again my day
"oh, just let me out"
"i've tried so hard, i can't get out"
"i just can't get out, my state of"
mind won't let me out
can't get out
awakening this morning
trying to get the sleep outta my eyes
"""i live no more to shame nor me nor you"
"i'm sorry"""
"born from silence, silenced full of it"
perfect concert my best friend
"so much to live for, so much to die for"
if only my heart had a home
sing what you can't say
forget what you can't play
hasten to drown into beautiful eyes
"walk within my poetry, this dying music"
-my loveletter to nobody
never sigh for better world
"it`s already composed, played and told"
every thought the music i write
everything a wish for the night
"wrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin"
died for the beauty the one in the garden
"created a kingdom, reached for the wisdom"
failed in becoming a god
never sigh for better world
"it`s already composed, played and told"
every thought the music i write
everything a wish for the night
"""if you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it"
for i`ve given this its strength and it has become my only strength.
"comforting home, mother`s lap, chance for immortality"
where being wanted became a thrill i never knew
"the sweet piano writing down my life"""
"""teach me passion for i fear it`s gone"
"show me love, hold the lorn"
so much more i wanted to give to the ones who love me
i`m sorry
time will tell (this bitter farewell)
i live no more to shame nor me nor you
"and you... i wish i didn`t feel for you anymore..."""
a lonely soul... an ocean soul...
a lonely soul... an ocean soul...
"""so much more i wanted to give to the ones who love me"
"time will tell..."""
a lonely soul... an ocean soul...
a lonely soul... an ocean soul...

metal galera
this is the band of the galera
"i, i'm on my way back, there's no regret"
there's no appreciation
"i, i lost all my faith, it's killing the blaze"
erases the flame of glory
"wait, we wait for a sign, longing for life"
"it's time to ride, we're riding the sky"
there's no need to cry
flying free like and eagle
on the way to eternity
no more cry no more reason
to forget all the endless pain
"i, i fell of the track, dropped of the edge"
by a slam of my self damnation
"i, i'm taking the blame, but memories remain"
raising the lust for living
"wait, we wait for a sign, longing for life"
"it's time to ride, we're riding the sky"
there's no need to cry
flying free like and eagle
on the way to eternity
no more cry no more reason

everybody needs somebody
everybody's gonna get a flame inside
everybody needs somebody
everybody's gonna get a flame inside
flying free like and eagle
on the way to eternity
no more cry no more reason
to forget all the endless pain
flying free like and eagle
spread your wings and glide away
"live your dream, live forever"
united in harmony
i'm turning back the wheel of time
to try to steal some more
"of passing hours, days and nights, now precious as bright gold"
"and as the wheel is moving slowly, in never ending grind"
the time has come to make the change as things are bound to die
"oh, i just have to light the darkness of my soul"
so i can find a place to hide and reach my final goal
forget the life i led so far and leave it all behind
and in the dawn of a million stars who knows what i will find
"in another time, in another place, in another space"
"in another time, in another place, in another space"
"lake comets fighting in the sky, a blast of shining stars"
"two different souls collide, at last to re-unite as one"
i'm heading back into future time to find where i belong
"the wheel will end his final turn, i complete my return"
"oh, i just have to light the darkness of my soul"
so i can find a place to hide and reach my final goal
forget the life i led so far and leave it all behind
and in the dawn of a million stars who knows what i will find
we live through space and time
we want more life and time
"we want more, more, more"
lost in thought
recounting the cost
when sanity became askew
when turning the pages
of life concentrated
on killing the sorrow
that tears us in two
a faded memory
of what used to be
the burden and the noose
just cut me loose (just cut me loose)
"it can't be mistaken, the spirit is vacant"
when hope for tomorrow is nowhere in view
living so close to a weakness
that continues to keep you held down
hear the sound
of the voice that is screaming
what's lost is now found
a faded memory
of what used to be
the burden and the noose
just cut me loose
oh! yeah!
ghosts of the past no longer torment me
i release the anguish
a faded memory
of what used to be
the burden and the noose
begging you to cut me loose
the burden and the noose
just cut me loose
cut me! cut me!
cut me loose!
"it starts deep within, just a feeling inside"
a hope in my heart i can no longer deny
"to break away, break away, break away, out of here"
"i'm a fool and a dreamer, with no place to run"
a man who's been hoping to touch the sun and
"to set himself free, free to reach for the eternal sky"
"now i feel the urge to follow my dream, forever free"
to spread my wings and fly high into the sky
i feared i would fall and fall down to the ground
but my will to ride free through the oceans of clouds
"is stronger now, stronger now,"
it's stronger than ever before
"i'll be a symbol of warning, of ambition to rise"
to fly beyond the light which is blinding my eyes
now on a strange wings i fly
i soar on the wonderful wings of a dream
never again to be bound by chains within cold walls
my decission is made and the time is now
a legend is born as the eyes of the world see
"icarus ascending, icarus ascending"
icarus ascending into the sky
"icarus ascending, icarus ascending"
icarus ascending into the sky
high into the sky
no one will ever stand in my way
no one will ever force me to stay
"and i'll fly away, fly away, fly far away from here"
i take a deep breath and i close my eyes
my legend is born as the eyes of the world see
icarus ascending into the sky
"i have no place to live, i must transcend"
to the other side
my wings may be burned by the rays of the sun
though my body is falling my spirit is rising high
high beyond the astral sky
icarus is free
maybe i am the man with those mystic two heads
"one facing down, the other facing back"
but i don't know who i am
and you still don't know who i am
maybe i am the man with the legendary four hands
"to finger, to heal, crave and strangulate"
but i don't know who i am
and you still don't know who i am
i am exhausted of returning to a place i've never been
i am exhausted of returning from a place i've never been
maybe i am the man of the universal two words
"the lie and the lie, the scorn and the scorn"
you want to know how i am
to forgive me what i am
i am exhausted of returning to a place i've never been
i am exhausted of returning from a place i've never been
i forgot who i am but i am too tired to be it
i forgot who i am but i am too tired to live/leave it
i am exhausted of returning to a place i've never been
i am exhausted of returning from a place i've never been
the poison is still in your veins
the poison i slipped in your drink
"never saw me,i am but a ghost"
never saw your dangerous host
wake up...you're still alive...wake up and die
all you can see in the darkness above
is the light in my eyes...
i'm standing on the edge of your grave
looking down
into the eyes of a dead...
buried alive...buried alive
wake up...you're still alive...wake up and die
how does it feel with my foot on your chest?
how does it feel?
tell me and i might forget
how does it feel to be so out of breath?
how does it feel?
tell me and i might forget...
buried alive...buried alive
"he started struggling,oh the fool"
moonlight shining in his drool
i slammed the shovel straight between his eyes
"""stay down"",i screamed ""you're here to die"""
"never saw me,i am but a ghost"
never saw your dangerous host
wake up...you're still alive...wake up and die
all you can see in the darkness above
is the light in my eyes...
i'm stoonding on the edge of your grave
looking down
into the eyes of a dead...
buried alive...buried alive
no matter what it is you believe
you're lucky when you die in your sleep
"""murder"",he screamed ""oh why?"" but that's a lie"
"you killed me first,so now die"
"i'm dead,but you die,i'm gonna bury you alive"
"""murder"" he screamed ""oh why?"""
two faced!
i feel you crawling under my skin
sickened by your face
"by the way, to think that you're so fucking kind?"
you ain't!
"hard to find how i feel, especially when you're smothering me"
"hard to find how i feel, please someone help me!"
"i knew when an angel whispered into my ear,"
"you gotta get him away, yeah"
hey little bitch!
be glad you finally walked away or you may have not lived another day.
"hard to find how i feel, especially when you're smothering me"
"hard to find how i feel, please someone help me"
"hard to find how i feel, controlling me every step of the way"
"hard to find how i feel, you greedy little baby"
"hard to find, hard to find, hard to find"
"yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!"
"hard to find how i feel, especially when you're smothering me"
"hard to find how i feel, please someone help me"
"hard to find how i feel, controlling me every step of the way"
"hard to find how i feel, you greedy little baby"
in this strange situation
the future is so unclear
and i stop and think about the times
i tried to disappear
so i wait within the endless days
reaching for the sun
who am i to be?
you could never see
always pretending
what you are to me
what am i to say?
when all you do is hate
got some news
nobody wins this game
this game
if i say i know the reasons
to implications that you bleed
never knowing how to feel
which one of me is real?
who am i to be?
you could never see
always pretending
what you are to me
what am i to say?
when all you do is hate
got some news
nobody wins this game
nobody wins this game
it’s all about yesterday
gonna find a way
someday
all the signs are there
so i’m on this tear
to right the bloody wrongs
to remain real strong
the approaching end
threads of life were spent
tried to justify
the decision’s never mine
if i say i know the reasons
to the unforeseen
i’ve come to clear your conscience
of the burdens
of a thousand dreams
so i walk within the endless days
as i’m reaching for the sun
who am i to be?
you could never see
always pretending
what you are to me
what am i to say?
when all you do is hate
got some news
nobody wins this game
this game
"driving my fist down deep inside it, oh yeah"
gonna take it to a whole new level in spite of your bullshit (baby)
"tasting sweet anxiety, breaking through another day"
maybe i just don't care anymore what you think of me
i'll take it to the edge
i'll take it to the other side
i hear it screaming
it's coming alive
i'll take it to the edge
i'll take it to the other side
i feel it breathing
deep down inside
deep down inside
"tearing through shards of broken glass, oh yeah"
getting one step closer to the edge and taking it all back (baby)
"surging through my blackened veins, uncontrolled in a different way"
i can't wait to get away from everything
i'll take it to the edge
i'll take it to the other side
i hear it screaming
it's coming alive
i'll take it to the edge
i'll take it to the other side
i feel it breathing
deep down inside
"oh yeah, alright"
"i feel it coming alive, yeah"
"oh yeah, alright"
i'm breaking on through the other side
i'll take it to the edge
i'll take it to the other side
i hear it screaming
it's coming alive
i'll take it to the edge
i'll take it to the other side
i feel it breathing
deep down inside
"i'll take it to the edge of life, alright"
"i'll take it to the edge of life, i'm so alive"
"i'll take it to the edge of life, alright"
"i'll take it to the edge of life, alright"
i'm an animal
i'm a victim
i'm the answer to your prayers
i'm a witness
i'm a witch hunt?
i'm the monster up the stairs
i'm the ghost that's
in the mirror
i'm everything that you fear
i'm ripped heart?
i'm soul-shot
i'm the voice that's in your hair
i've seen it all
still can't taste it
smash to the wall
brought me to my knees
i've done it all
"fucked up, wasted"
stealing the blood
now inside i'm seen
i'm the hunted
i'm the predator
i'm the answer to the real
i'm the up-beat
i'm the head-fuck?
i'm the window smashed in the middle
i'm the player
i'm the nyeve (cant spell it)
i'm the one who's not addicted
i'm the logic
to the fuck up
i'm the broken one who fixed it
i've seen it all
still can't taste it
smash to the wall
brought me to my knees
i've done it all
"fucked up, wasted"
stealing the blood
now inside i'm seen
i've seen it all
still can't taste it
smash to the wall
brought me to my knees
i've done it all
"fucked up, wasted"
stealing the blood
now inside i'm seen
i'm just a child with the tears in it's eyes
i am holding this gift that is broken
why do i have
left now
i've seen it all
still can't taste it
smash to the wall
brought me to my knees
i've done it all
"fucked up, wasted"
stealing the blood
now inside i'm seen
i've seen it all
still can't taste it
smash to the wall
brought me to my knees
i've done it all
"fucked up, wasted"
stealing the blood
now inside i'm seen
lyrics by juninho lopes
i am an enemy of everything
my life is not for sale
my heart is in this fight forever
what can you take from me?
there's not a single fucking day i haven't fought to stay alive
we're finding hope in the hopeless
i am still their voice that gets stuck in your head
i am me
and i've come to fucking scare you to death
because that's what you deserve you disgusting piece of shit
i know the only words that you have for me
"are ""give up!"" and ""get out!"""
you'd like to think that we've been beaten
but we're here to stay
forever and always
every single day
"not giving up, living up all my dreams"
so go ahead and look like i'm inferior
"condescension, suffering, callousness and loathing"
are the badges i have earned for my cause
and i am finding hope within hatred
"a reason to persist, to push past everything"
we are here
and we have come to scare you to death
because that's what you deserve
you fucking fake ass hypocrite
i know the only words that you have for me
"are ""give up!"" and ""get out!"""
you'd like to think that we've been beaten
but we're here to stay
forever and always
so loud
we are the ones that you pushed away
for drowning your voice out
you'd like to think that we've been defeated
but we're here to stay
forever and always
we've been through everything
and we all have our scars
we may be broken but you
can't kill all of us
goooooooo!!!
think before you fucking speak
"i am no villain, think before you fucking speak"
people fear what they don't understand
and so now beauty has become the fucking beast
(maybe you didn't hear me?)
i said go fuck yourself!!!
i know the only words that you have for me
"are ""give up!"" and ""get out!"""
you'd like to think that we've been beaten
but we're here to stay
forever and always
so loud
we are the ones that you pushed away
for drowning your voice out
you'd like to think that we've been defeated
but we're here to stay
forever and always

that's it from now. i don't know the solo yet and i don't think i'll be able to play it anyway...
red meat is the inner shrine of our immortal soul
the heart breaking out illusions of innocent blood
desire is pain
eating away the worm in the brain
our flesh burns in mysterious ways
gray matter is the unholy clay of our address on earth
frontiers are coming down between body and the soul
"abrasive, insane"
putting away the spark in the brain
our flesh works in mysterious ways
our flesh burns in mysterious ways
"i wanna know,"
"where did you go, to which part of the city"
"i kept on moving,"
struggling around to find you in all places
city lights turned out in all darkness
"strangers are lost, just searching around"
way down in the chamber of life
"blocked out, just tryin' to survive"
"left all alone, but they had to be strong"
"coming from nowhere,"
and the candle lit the shadows
"we're coming home, we're on our way"
"coming from nowhere,"
and the lightning hit the shadows
"still have a long, long way to go"
a long way to go
"they disappeared, contact lost,"
when did you leave?
"the tide is turning, waves are high,"
overflowing the shore
"high and low, no feel to surrender"
the wind just blows the rain in my face
"holy grail, no time to disgrace"
these ghosts i keep inside
shards of glass in my veins
"release me from myself, release"
from my duality
i face this as a soldier would
but useless is my war
the innocence that smiles today
tomorrow will be lying
"who is that really dies, when all the people look at me?"
and i'm twisting my fingers in my hair
while a mirror reflects me
now i'm digging to the bone
all the painting
"scratching at flesh, drives me mad"
to be alive and free
and the ghosts i keep inside myself
how do they see me?
while again i'm drowning
with my soul
you will save me?
baptised with a perfect name
the doubting one by heart
alone without himself
war between him and the day
need someone to blame
"in the end, little he can do alone"
you believe but what you see
you receive but what you give
reach
for hand-held heart through life
for the dancer to arrive
reach
and catch me before i fall
apart from the wandering pack
in this brief flight of time we reach
"for the ones, whoever dare"
you believe but what you see
you receive but what you give
reach
for hand-held heart through life
for the dancer to arrive
reach
and catch me before i fall
reach
for a friend whoever cares
for someone whoever dares
reach
to catch me when i fall
reaching for the doubting one by heart
hearing voices of the
catch the one who's falling
night is falling
brothers in blood
invincible in their faith
"deceiver, believer,"
stronger than steel
insanity is what i feel
here i stand
take my hand
let us flee
to be free
i'm a liar
i'm a sinner
i feel pain
running through my veins
i'm a liar
i'm a sinner
i feel pain
of my own destiny
"fighting, dying,"
revenge in blood
listen to the tongues of hate
"destroyer, betrayer,"
witness of love
sadness is my lonley fate
here i stand
take my hand
let us flee
to be free
i'm a liar
i'm a sinner
i feel pain
running through my veins
i'm a liar
i'm a sinner
i feel pain
of my own destiny
"you fell away,"
"what more can i say,"
"the feelings evolved,"
"i wont let it out,"
"i cant replace,"
"your screaming face,"
"feeling the sickness inside,"
"why wont you die,"
"your blood in mine,"
"we'll be fine,"
"then your body will be mine,"
"so many words,"
"can discribe my face,"
"this feelings evolved,"
"so soon to break out,"
i cant relate
"to happy states,"
feeling the blood run inside
"why wont you die,"
"your blood in mine,"
"we'll be fine,"
"then your body will be mine,"
why is everything so fucking hard for me?
keep me down to watch you think i should be
must you tempt me and provoke the ministry
keep on trying i'm not dying so easily
(i will not die)
why is everything so fucking hard for me? (i will not die)
why is everything so fucking hard for me? (i will not die)
"why wont you die,"

light fails at dawn
the moon is gone
and deadly the night reigns
deceit
finally i've found myself
in these lands
horror and madness i've seen here
for what i became a king of the lost?
barren and lifeless the land lies
lord of all noldor
a star in the night
and a bearer of hope
he rides into his glorious battle alone
farewell to the valiant warlord
the fate of us all
lies deep in the dark
when time stands still at the iron hill
the fate of us all
lies deep in the dark
when time stands still at the iron hill
i stand alone
noone's by my side
i'll dare you
come out
you coward
now it's me or you
he gleams like a star
and the sound of his horn's
like a raging storm
proudly the high lord
challenges the doom
lord of slaves he cries
slowly in fear
the dark lord appears
welcome to my lands
you shall be damned
lord of all noldor
a star in the night
and a bearer of hope
he rides into his glorious battle alone
farewell to the valiant warlord
the fate of us all
lies deep in the dark
when time stands still at the iron hill
the fate of us all
lies deep in the dark
when time stands still at the iron hill
the iron crowned
is getting closer
swings his hammer
down on him
like a thunderstorm
he's crushing
down the noldor's
proudest king
under my foot
so hopeless it seems
you've troubled my day
now feel the pain
lord of all noldor
a star in the night
and a bearer of hope
he rides into his glorious battle alone
farewell to the valiant warlord
the fate of us all
lies deep in the dark
when time stands still at the iron hill
the fate of us all
lies deep in the dark
when time stands still at the iron hill
the elven king's broken
he stumbles and falls
the most proud and most valiant
his spririt survives
praise our king
praise our king
praise our king
praise our king
sometimes we only live for the here and now
sometimes we're lonely
sometimes we feel we need a place to be grounded
or fly away again
i will fly away again
i will fly away again
i feel rain pouring down
i wait to rot away
live again
here forever
the spiral never ends
never ends
why are we feeling something's familiar around us?
are we just dreaming?
always we search for the answers but nothing is found
we'll fly away again
i will fly away again
i will fly away again
i feel rain pouring down
i wait to rot away
live again
here forever
the spiral never ends
rot away
live again
here forever
the spiral never ends
i feel rain pouring down
i wait to rot away
live again
here forever
the spiral never ends
rot away
live again
here forever
the spiral never ends
it never ends
i will fly away again
i will fly away again
i will fly away again
i will fly away again
shooting from the lip at those tired old cliches
well it takes one to know one
same difference - roughed up for today
every minute blemish is given that street veneer
choreographed to cut the slack
just as long as you learn to sneer
"paper-thin, paper-weight - how's that demographic?"
"a disempowered herd, minds cloud with static"
minds cloud with static
lowest common denominator
give them hard fuck fables
give them middle fingers
give them surface tension
spoon-feed them to the system
"so what's ""nu""? sullen view - it's the clued you"
fighting third world war on parental torpor
fighting third world war
give them hard fuck fables
give them middle fingers
give them surface tension
strike!
fast and hard show no mercy for these men
"the vermin of christ, prophets of lies and their disciples"
"seek them out, hunt them down"
"brake their spirits, crush their hearts"
not even death will set them free from this pain
charge!
ride them down as they flee from our steel
"draw their blood, make them suffer"
before they die by war-field sacrifice
"wipe them out, burn their homes and fields"
"feed the wolves with their offspring, annihilate them all"
masters of war torment every soul
rape every whore that carries the cross
fire!
"burn them all, burn them alive"
send their souls to deathqueens hall
to the land of cold burning flames
send them to the land of famine and despair
eternally they will starve and freeze
(solo: mikkonen)
slaveing for eternity
aiming for construction
wreckless crew abandon me
bringing on destruction
"primal needs, annoying ways"
incapacitation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
a legacy of submankind
who seem to rule this nation
out of touch with your life
can' t you see the signs
for me to know
can you find out
read betwen the lines
no way out
when the cat goes away
over and out
the mice come out and play
unrelentless trilogy
asking to accept them
tempers flare
screams are heard
to uphold the profession
time and time and times again
i will not play your game
i ask you once a billion times
to keep your life the same
no way out
when the cat goes away
over and out
the mice come out and play
no way out
the price that you must pay
over and out
secrets buried deep at the bottom of my heart
"and beaten throughout every color of my life, i fall apart"
"i don't belong, i don't fit in"
"i'm dead and gone, i thought they might come waiting"
i'm holding on to what's within
i'm coming strong with everything i can
"reaching, does anyone still believe in who i am?"
"bleeding, every part of me is being taken from deep within"
"understand, it's who i am"
"i don't belong, i don't fit in"

my end of days i'm hoping will be gone
"i don't belong, i don't fit in"
"i'm dead and gone, i thought they might come waiting"
i'm holding on to what's within
i'm coming strong with everything i can
"i don't belong, i don't fit in"

"understand, it's who i am"
pain and distrust
"and a lust for uncertainty,"
inflict the hearts of the weak
"with your entity,"
disrupt their lives and take flight.
"garbage of god,"
"and disposed to humanity,"
rampaging hurt you
"impose your insanity,"
welter in hate of the
"one who reviled you,"
stripped of the rights that you
"thoght you would never loose,"
driven insane immolate in the agony
"burden the world with your lies of integrity,"
"hell will befall your angelic mistrust,"
thrown fromn the heaven's
disgraced in disugust.
"angel of agony, demonic blasphemy,"
"angel of agony, drown in your vanity,"
"angel of agony, victimize empathy,"
"angel of agony, fall to your death..."
ghost of aggression
"intermix in your self defeat,"
savage desire unrequit
"to the laes of thee,"
"imprison you till you are dead,"
damage undone
"washed away for eternity,"
restore the life that you
"thought you could take from me,"
anger invoked to the point
"of destroying you,"
angel of pain revelate
"in a pending doom,"
dead in the heart
"self destruct in the eyes of he,"
dwelling rejection for
"the pain you refuse to see,"
ingest defeat devastate
"in the final thrall,"
suffer a fate that the
"lord has reserved for all,"
refuse the word underfed
"by the wisest one,"
shower yourself in a blame
"that will not succumb,"
alone you will go to your death...

forgotten images of what we are.

to bring you pain as much as tears
you'll never know what's in my mind
it's an invitation to my way
pray to me or you will pay

"woman, i know it's not easy to say"
but i miss you the longer i'm so far away
"you know me, it's not easy to find the words"
"woman, i miss you each day in the desert"
"woman, tomorrow i might bite the dust"
"believe me, i don't want to stay but i must"
"god help me, i'm so afraid, don't let me down"
"oh, woman, i love you, i love you, i love you,"
"how i long for you, woman"
we belong to each other...
"woman, i'm so afraid, don't let me down"
"oh, woman, i love you, i love you, i love you,"
in the gunfire's roaring sound
when i'm falling to the ground
i can see your face so real
"oh, how i long for you, woman"
we belong to each other...
i wish it would be like before
in the days of the cold war
we could play around in peace
oh how i long for you woman
telepathic illusion injected into mass pathology
lies of all religions of priests
versions of genesis
and non-existent prophets
a dry silhouette of dead god
propelled by the
damaged frontal lobes
the obtuse humans
roam in somnambulism
towards the deaf walls
kneel and pray to nothingness there
as if the dead toll
of bloodless massacre
holy charisma as mind control shift
psychic magnetic field
endless emanation braindeads
pierced by
phalloid obelisks
no one not even there
saviour had ever been resurrected
"abandoned, disposed, discarded"
i order all symbols crumble
i order the consumption of all churches
your face betrays your words
and those words gave way to hurt
the ground between us grows
like wounds that never show
but the distance couldn't mend
'cause the time ran out instead
the ground between us grows
like wounds that never show
of father and son
two lives now come undone
of father and son
"too late, now all is gone"
so tonight
i'm scattering the ashes
i'm scattering the ashes
your face reveals your pain
"seconds lost, i take the blame"
the cold light cuts the night
your ashes come to life
what's left is in my hands
will i ever understand?

i couldn't swim against the tides of blame
i knew there was no other way
you better practice your lines
you better practice your words

pushed down the stairs - built of coffins
morbid fear - in the dungeons
tied to the rack - knife across your breasts
beaten and strangled - brutal shattered chest
suffocate in blood
extorted confession
intense excruciatoin
total evisceratoin
await the execution
nail driven into your eyes
crucifix pressed to your forehead
evil exorcised
fucked by the bishop - in front of a laughing crowd
forced down on your knees - swallow holy cum
torn out vagina - sawed off limbs
glowing iron in your anus - broken on the wheel
ripped to shreds
extorted confession
intense excruciatoin
total evisceratoin
await the execution
now you are carried to the pyre
soon to be released
purity through fire
from the top ov the highest mountain
"prior to descent, my fall for thee"
my weapon is silence
"i, bringer ov light to burn this goddamn eden down!"
behold! i rise from primal silence
as a storm crushing dismal shores ov acheron
my weapon is violence
from the mud ov the earth
back to the womb ov babalon!
sink in the stream ov woe
acheron!
rise above the eyes ov god
necromanteion!
i am the oracle
i am the grace ov god
i am the stream ov woe
i am wrath from above
from neptunian realm arisen
babylon the great i praised
with the voice ov silence
i called the genii ov the heights and depths
i came down as raging mars
as volcanic fire god
totality and i are one
in the absence ov light
infinite i shall become
sink in the stream ov woe
acheron!
rise above the eyes ov god
necromanteion!
you run around your little town preaching
and hiding from facing me
i'm gonna roll in and take away
all your credibility for all to see
"i can see right through you, worthless man"
you seem to underestimate who i am
cause i'll break your face like
"ooh, i'm locked and loaded, you'll get no respect"
"ooh, i'm locked and loaded in your hand, how you like it?"
don't cry to me for sympathy here
"and all your whining, it fucking tires me"
"you don't know me, so get up off your knees"
and start saluting me for your publicity
"i can see right through you, worthless man"
you seem to underestimate who i am
cause i'll break your face like
"ooh, i'm locked and loaded, you'll get no respect"
"ooh, i'm locked and loaded in your hand"
"ooh, i'm locked and loaded, you'll get no respect"
"ooh, i'm locked and loaded in your hand, how you like it?"
"all you do is talk shit like a bitch, never backing it"
hiding behind walls like maggot
i wish you'd step up in my face
don't run away whenever you see me in your space
"hah, you're dead, hah, dead"
"ooh, i'm locked and loaded, you'll get no respect"
"ooh, i'm locked and loaded in your hand"
"ooh, i'm locked and loaded, you'll get no respect"
"ooh, i'm locked and loaded in your hand, how you like it?"
you're hangin' around and got nothin' to do
you wanna get out some pills in front of you
you fly on invisible wings
be careful my friend for too many can kill
you say that the meaning of life's in those pills
you forget all earthly things
you swallow your pill you wanna feel free
a trip to a world made of games
you do it again yet it's never the same
but a junkie's not something to be
starlight fallin' in deep through your eyes
starlight shinnin' down for your soul to rise
now there's a needle lying in front of you
i'm frightened of those things
but i know what you'll do
"you need it to escape from the night, ha ha"
you ride on through heaven you don't feel no pain
you ride on and ride on again and again
on the needle that brings you the light
you feel the mind-blowin' stuff
flow through your venis
you take off and fly to the sun
but when you get to near your wings will be burnt
you'll die in the flames and you'll fall
not long ago but far away
a rainy winters day
all her pain she kept inside
could no longer hide
no cry for help
she killed herself
both life & love could not be saved
she took them both to the grave
a pair of souls become undone
where were two now one
divided by this wall of death
i soon will join you yet
with my blood i'll find your love
you found the strength to end your life
as you did so shall i
oh no
please don't go
it's like a death in the family
a crimson pool so warm & deep
lulls me to an endless sleep
your hand in mine - i will be brave
take me from this earth
"an endless night - this, the end of life"
from the dark i feel your lips
and i taste your bloody kiss
oh no
please don't go
it's like a death in the family
don't die on me
don't die on me
don't die on me
don't die
"legs are tied, these hands are broken"
alone i try with words unspoken
"silent cry, a breath is frozen"
"with blinded eyes, i fear myself"
"it's burning down, it's burning high"
"when ashes fall, the legends rise"
we burn it out a mile wide
"when ashes fall, the legends rise"
"throat is dry, my vision's fading"
i'm paralyzed and left here waiting
"taking time, just one step forward"
"won't lose my mind, i'm here to stay"
"it's burning down, it's burning high"
"when ashes fall, the legends rise"
we burn it out a mile wide
"when ashes fall, the legends rise"
whoa (legends rise)
whoa (legends rise)
(legends rise)
(you gonna do something about it or just stand there and bleed?)
(legends rise)
"it's burning down, it's burning high"
"when ashes fall, the legends rise"
we burn it out a mile wide
"when ashes fall, the legends rise"
whoa (legends rise)
whoa (legends rise)
the thouht of you has plagued my years
i see you now
crawling all over me
symptom of my darkest fears
with me now
living inside of me
in the night
as you sleep
the web begins to form
across your face to suffocate
and kill before the dawn
arachnid
strangely drawn towards her lair
"certain death ,"
she wants to be part of you
lie in wait my choice of mate
i can't resist she
bites and devours you
lift your body
from the ground
strech octapoidal limbs
leave the web
without a sound
the fantasy begins
come into the parlour said the spider
to the fly
not really knowing that the end is
drawing nigh
"making love in ecstacy,the venom she injects"
"death is swift,limbs entwined amid"
arachnid sex
the scent you spread i know so well
could leave me dead
hopelessly mesmerised
your bite will mean the end to me
can you see i'm
helplessly hypnotised
panic stricken
terrified
cocooned within the web
arachnophobic
misery
release me from this living nightmare
if i stalk you must
forgive me
for this dance is my
chemistry
"i remember when, chasing shadows ends"
as a child i was never like this
"many times i've tried, asking myself why"
why i still go on chasing this dream
what am i to do?
all i know is what i feel is true
it's a challenge for life
every day feels like night
"i, i will become, and when i've won"
when i have conquered time and space
i will live on and you will remember what i've done
"in another time, maybe somehow i"
would have gotten another chance
if their minds could change
somehow rearranged
with eyes opened they'd see my deeds
what am i to do?
all i know is what i feel is true
it's a challenge for life
every day feels like night
"i, i will become, and when i've won"
when i have conquered time and space
i will live on and you will remember what i've done
"i, i will become, and when i've won"
when i have conquered time and space
i will live on and you will remember what i've done
"written in stone, i will live on"
you will remember what i've done
"i, i will become, and when i've won"
in time i'll live for ever on
don't leave you said to me
and for a moment i feared i'd stay
but your plea rang hollow so i quietly
walked away
i can see you through the glass
and i wonder was it done in vain
now i'd do anything
to simply make the pain go away
if you'd have me i'd take you back again
and erase the mistakes i've made
if you'd have me i'd take you back again
and add to the mistakes i've made
i remember morning light
and a shower to clear my head
everyday a reminder of what a fool i've
been
seemed when i left you i'd left everything i'd
known
now you have shown me
i'm not the man i thought i was
i believed in you
i had faith in you
i was there for you
now i'm lost in you
all the people gone street fighting mad
(would it matter hard winner)
that's the reason why they join the gang
"no friendship, just cause"
we just stay the way we are
(...) heroes
we control the city roads
free wheelin' on the highway
a hundred enjines are racing around
like thunder and lightning
can't you hear the roaring sound
breaking rules getting on us
"you're thinking fat, you are the star"
"(but we hate you, them faces)"
you're little houses and (...) cars
"hate you hate you, leave us alone man"
keep your stuff and stay where you are
"hate you hate you, leave us alone man"
"keep your stuff, and stay where you are"
"hate you hate you, leave us alone man"
keep your stuff and stay where you are
"hate you hate you, leave us alone man"
"keep your stuff, and stay where you are"
"like leather, steel enjines"
all the people gone street fighting mad
(would it matter hard winner)
that's the reason why they join the gang
"no friendship, just cause"
we just stay the way we are
(...) heroes
we control the city roads
"hate you hate you, leave us alone man"

i am she who spits out the lusts
the root ov sin derived from me
i am born ov sacrilegious uterus
magna peccatrix
i am she who cast the enemies out
i am the spawn ov her vulva obsolete
libera nos blasfemia madonna
magna hecate
with the sound ov trumpets!
with the pounding ov demon drums!
come forth within!
come forth without!
with the roaring thunders
with the blinding light
come to be exalted!
come to be despised!
for i am aurora's son
"with no beginning, with no decline"
sabbath mater dolorosa
a progeny ov her lecherous cunt
love me orgasmically
fuck me ecstatically
genetrix meretix
i pledge my heart to thee
i bow down devotedly
with the sound ov trumpets!
with the pounding ov demon drums!
come forth within!

"cast out ov egypt were we, with lust embraced serpentine heart"
our wrath shalt now shower o'er the earth
"praise to thee, whose tongue doth speak fire"
"dionisos, orpheus, attis, osiris"
"slain now resurrected, shackled now released"
"bring forth ecstasy, the ulmost delight"
come wholly to me as lifes' water is poured by thy side
'twas from sacred society not mother we were spawned
"to manifest by will alone our visions, more it be!"
we are the khaos warriors
the architects ov fate
our sight sees far beyond
the light of the day
our thoughts secluded well
amidst the darkness of night
shall be no final warning
before our battle cry!
"breathe out in ecstasy, swallow the seed of truth"
"transgression is the might, transgression is the key"
"this is the law of scourge, the eye ov true revenge"
placing trust upon our blade against ignorance
"dionisos, orpheus, attis, osiris"
"slain now resurrected, shackled now released"
"hear is crippled souls, behold is ye blind fools"
awake in fear and feel the touch ov bitter bliss
"its no time for repenting, its time to kiss our swords"
"we are the new beginning, we light our torch ov war"
we are the kaos warriors
modern iconoclast
"cleansers, lurking, waiting"
we are all and without equal
our fists crush the concrete walls
our hearts infused with rage
in freedom our souls burn
conquered we can be not
our fate 'tis fueled by forces
awakening to herald
gone... (x2)
the time had finally come to kill the vein.
and i'm dropping down the dirt on your grave
"it might hurt so bad, but i can't feel sad"
rid of a fool like you
the wrath has just begun
the time has finally come
"and it hurts so bad, and it drives me mad"
life with a blinded view (of you)
it makes them disappear
it fills their life with fear
when their future isn't clear
it makes them disappear
- gone - (x2)
so the coward has up and run to be saved
"but with each step taken down, you sink in your grave"
"it might hurt so bad, but i can't feel sad"
rid of a fool like you
get the fuck on down the road
(solo)
(hang on) got to go
preview what they oughtta know
keep your head down and fucking die
(wake up) rise and shine
gotta take another pint
dig heads and watch out for the night
when the sun comes down and the moon comes up in the sky
the battle of the day and the night
"(kill, kill, kill) go fuck another one"
candlelight burns in a wood so high
on a carpet (flying high) take it down to the other side
the way beyond it may lie
when the moon comes up and is rescuing under the night
"the reaper is on the other side, let's go"
bodom after midnight
bodom after midnight yeah
now the time has come for to leave this land
take my charge with pride sacrifice
oooh
running and hiding i'm left for the time
to bring back the order of devine
hunted by goblins no gandalf to help
with swords in the night
oh the last part of the game
decision of death and life
blood for sauron they'll call tonight
the final battle cry
running and hiding i'm left for the time
to bring back the order of devine
there exist no tales and hobbits are crying
for all
children of death
i have a dream
the things you've to hide for
deliver
our kingdom and our reich
don't fall in panic
just give me the thing
that i need or i kill
don't run away
for what have i done
refrain:
oooh majesty
your kingdom is lost
and you will leave us behind
oooh majesty
your kingdom is lost
and ruins remind of your time
now come back
refrain:
oooh majesty
your kingdom is lost
and you will leave us behind
oooh majesty
your kingdom is lost
and ruins remind of your time
"run, run, run"
cries
cries in a dark land
hear the voice it's cold as ice
eyes
they are watching
they look for me but cannot find
creature is following no place to escape
my last steps will find the right way
where is the future the call of the blind
cause there is none to find
watch the sky you see no light
my weapons burst with fear
with the howling wolves the nazgul will die
for all
children of death
cries
cries in a dark land
hear the voice it's cold as ice
eyes
they are watching
they look for me but cannot find
run
run for the whole world
it's time you cannot wait
lost
lost in a dark world
you feel the strange but cannot see
too many battles we carry along from the war
and too many frightens we feel from his law
for so many victories we're praising so strong
for so many blood we've lost
refrain:
oooh majesty
your kingdom is lost
and you will leave us behind
oooh majesty
your kingdom is lost
and ruins remind of your time
"run, run, run"
behind
"run, run"
i won't live to see tomorrow
there won't be another breath
none of them will ever sorrow
those who sentenced me to death
i've been waiting here for ages
for the hangman to appear
soon the priest will read some pages
from the bible for my fear
i see a place an evil place
comin' my way
what can i do where can i run
i'm gonna die anyway
things are getting clearer
this is the price i have to pay
i feel like screaming out my anger
there is so much left here to do
when it happened i was younger
and my destiny was you
i see a place an evil place...
what can i do about leaving you
we were only halfway through
what can i say
there was no other way
they wouldn't let me stay
approach and try to live me backwards
then without looking behind
surviving is somewhat confusing
although i never mind
if only silence could ever talk
how loud will be the voice
"of this sincerely yours, violently yours"
without you i am mute
"without you, raped and nude"
(without you) [no] (while you are the) one can touch me like i do
if only you could crawl by yourself
and release me from all your weight
would i still love you to the point of hate?
cherish my guilt and then juggle with it
that paper jesus on your bedroom wall
will bleed us to redeem
without you i am mute
"without you, raped and nude,"
(without you) [no] (while you are the) one can hurt me like you do
i want to know how it feels
to proceed without sharing it
your devil disguise is breaking
your face is now so crude
conscious blind and deaf and mute
it is the only way to be just near of you
it is the only way to show myself to you
without you i am mute
"raped and nude, without you..."
silent rage (jorn & russell)
refused to see the misery
don't you hear the crying souls
refused to give a helping hand
you give me no choice
but to show you the world around you
show you a life in pain
there is no world going on here
right before your eyes
i wonder why
you keep denied
the silent rage going on right now
don't walk away
you need to stay
the silent rage won't be silent
silent no more
oooouuuuououooooohhhh
won't be silent no more yeah
refused to see the sadness
don't you see the bleeding hearts
refused to give them second thoughts
you give me no choice
but to show you the world around you
show you a life in pain
there is no world going on here
right before your eyes
i wonder why
you keep denied
the silent rage going on right now
don't walk away
you need to stay
the silent rage won't be silent
silent no more
silent no more
mmmmmmhhh mmmmmhhhhh
mmmmmhhhhh
won't be silent
no more
i wonder why
you keep denied
the silent rage going on right now
don't walk away
you need to stay
the silent rage won't be silent
silent no more
won't be silent
silent no more
i am the world that hides the universal
secret of all time
destruction of the empty spaces is my
one and only crime
i've lived a thousand times
i found out what it means to be believed
the thoughts and images
the unborn child who never was conceived
when little worlds collide
i'm trapped inside my embryonic cell
and flashing memories
are cast into the never ending well
the name that scorns the face
the child that never sees the cause of man
the deathly darkness that
belies the face of those who never ran
you gotta believe me
i'm talking to you
well i know its hard for you to know the reason why
and i know you'll understand when it's time to die
don't believe the life you have will be the only one
you have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on
i want you to listen
i'm trying to get through
love has given life to you and now its your concern
unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return
still i look but not to touch
the seeds of life are sown
curtain of the future falls
the secret stays unknown
just remember love is life
and hate is living death
treat your life for what its worth
and live for every breath
looking back i've lived and learned
but now i'm wondering
here i wait and only guess
what this next life will bring
ha ha!!
breaking news just another fool
despicable people rule
prevaricating manifests
questioning common senses is the test
why should the world be yours?
while we open all those doors
it seems as if the truth was stolen
society indeed is broken
by the millions serve and relay
on our nation's good will in place
bestowing upon common folk
"dependency, conformity"
why should the world be yours?
while we open all those doors
it seems as if the truth was stolen
society indeed is broken
how can only a few of them
lead millions into despair
like lab mice expendable
by the masses they must be hanged
[turner]
welcome to the aftermath of the incidence
that made the tower fall
another screw to another wheel
for another mind won't stray anymore
oh won't stray away from its brain
oh no…

the time will come: you will know what you need

you don't mind what you don't see at all
[turner]
the tongue of nations brought the line
reason occupied: the god-machine oh
a splendid steaming dream will tower to the sky
[sammet]
we'll exploit another 'morrow
we drained another day
the glowing of the future in our eyes
and time will reveal what we need
the watchmakers' dream
the watchmakers' dream
[turner]
we must finalise the giant
to zeroise the will and level off all minds
the time will come that you
will know what you need
[sammet]
the watchmakers' dream
the watchmakers' dream

the watchmakers' dream - will we slice infinity
the watchmakers' dream - for all the world to see
the watchmakers' dream - we give you what you need

(merci à madsoul pour cettes paroles)
in a lifetime
there's a moment
to awaken
to the sound of
your heartbeat
unbroken
and you? re free now
and i will remain
still dreaming
alive and aware
the love that i once believed in
and one day you? ll feel me
a whisper upon the breeze
and i? ll watch you stand there
unafraid
and i'll speak to you silently
and know that you hear me
the feeling is more than i've ever known
and one day you? ll feel me
a whisper upon the breeze
and i? ll watch you stand there
unafraid
and i'll speak to you silently
and know that you hear me
come back to me
please believe
the feeling is more than i've ever known
i can? t believe it was just an illusion
the feeling is more than i've ever known
and one day you? ll feel me
a whisper upon the breeze
since love has come to me
since then you've walked away
life is a mystery
the roses on my coffin
are the dreams you gave to me
love is blind
and all the flowers died for you
"this land so black, so fair for you"
here in this wonderland
purple the ecstasy
"mist enticing, penetrating"
lust i inhale
cold is the night today
darker than months of may
love is blind
your arms where a hearse for me
desire driving me
into this grave
and all the bells shall ring for you
transparent love we shall see through
sleep in this wonderland
of purple ecstasy
"mist enticing, penetrating"
lust i inhale
fear not the wind
it's telling a tale
into the whitest night
we slip away...
...not dead enough to be alive
i've seen strange signs on my way
silent shadows
dancing shapes
and angels fallen on the earth
face up
and look there
when the root ov thy being cannot reach
art thou nephilim child?
are ye looking for thy elysium?
here among the living trees?
"among the fading stars, variablility ov forms?"
"sometimes love, sometimes sadness ov things"
"sometimes rapture, and wine o sabbath"
"sometimes hatred, divine rage"
"and 93 rears, no limit, beyond the sin - gilgolem"
ye taught me the secret words:
iao sabao
protect thy daimon
why why whisper thoughts
but might is raised
when conjurer of seasons
"hums the song...sorrowful, joyful"
night is eternal
and day is eternal
with runes ov life
and runes ov death
"as above, so below"
beyond two thousand in the future wars beyond the limits of our mind
central computer that control and know the simple weakness of mankind
humanoid living in a structured will walking in a lifeless path
motor with a need to kill need to kill need to kill
searching through the wreckages of molten steel and glass seeing all in infra red and heavy in its mass
terminate exterminate the son of connor reese you must prevent the bastard ever being born
stop at nothing kill at will but rid the earth of this small child you must deter this fucking evil spawn
mark the dogs for only they know your not human your ot flesh at all
break the jaw before it speaks and kill the men that answer to its call
justified in genocide and leave them in theiir broken pride until they realize that it's no use
unsuspecting victim one guerilla fighter with a gun the terminator's finally been let loose
try to run but only they know there's nowhere to run nowhere to hide
cornered trapped by the death machine don't you go to sleep don't close your eyes ah
beyond twp thousand in the future wars beyond the limits of our mind
"central computer, that control and know the simple weakness of mankind"
and still the armies of robotic men crushing the humans in their path
lifeless of pain and a void of sorrow create a crimson aftermath
[music and lyrics by p. wagner]
"i awoke, i could not stay for more,"
i tried to tell the others what i'd seen before.
"no one believed me, ""it's a dream"" they said."
but i have seen eternity when i was dead.
who decided who's to go and who's to stay on this old world?
this time now my path lead me to life.
there was a vision that lightened up my life
and now i know it was death that i have tried.
"although i came back i've seen the other side,"
so i will never forget until i die.
i remember seeing my body lying
"after the accident, my soul was drifting away,"
passing darkness to a golden light
into the arms of jesus with my fathers eyes.
he decided i'd to go and stay for longer in this world
until i have walked my path of life.
there was a vision...
"there's a legion of the long - gone there,"
a bundled energy of all that once were here.
"no one's lost, a comfort we can share,"
"like a kind of existence, timeless, everywhere."
"walking through the city, looking oh so pretty,"
i've just got to find my way.
see the ladies flashing. all there legs and lashes.
i've just got to find my way.
well you see me crawling through the bushes
with it open wide.
what you seeing girl?
"can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it,"
can't you believe your eyes?
it's the real thing girl.
"got me feeling myself and reeling around,"
got me talking but feel like walking around.
got me feeling myself and reeling a...
got me talking but nothing's with me...
got me feeling myself and reeling around.
hands on the wheel
all is straight ahead
left behind
second guessing all that i once said
i once said
i once said
my spirit is bent and there's blood on my hands
"the more i'm down, the less i understand"
"once so found, now so lost"
all is black and white
wouldn't change even if i could
i'll take what i'm handed
whether it's damned or if it's good
if it's good
if it's good
my spirit is bent and there's blood on my hands
"the more i'm down, the less i understand"
"once so found, now so lost"
my spirit is bent and there's blood on my hands
"the more i'm down, the less i understand"
"once so found, now so lost"
[music: d. klupp - words: r. mythiasin]
in these days that we're presently living
so much tension complicating the flow
too many tribes of this earth in conflict
the fire raging now about to explode!
humanity is standing at the crossroads
faced whit decisions and it's outcome unknow
"looking to the shaman for wisdom,"
we smoke with him and visions start to unfur!
he spoke of a time of cleansing
when mother earth could be defiled no more!
"rainmaker bring down the water,"
washin' all over the earth
"for too long we breathe in pollution,"
is that what all mankind deserves?
sitting in a circle chanting
"smoke fills the air, we fall in trance again"
drumbeats pounding in hypnotic rhythms
remotely viewing all the future events
cataclysms devour the coast-lines
the ozone layer has finally collapsed!
"rainmaker bring down the water,"
washin' all over the earth
"for too long we breathe in pollution,"
is that what all mankind deserves?
"cleansing of the white man, abusing mother earth,"
"the prophecy unfolding, so cryptic are these words!"
[solo danny]
is there time to change our fate?
"or is there no time, because it's too late?"
is that what all mankind deserves...

"you are not a friend of mine, spare the fucking gospel time"
"try to turn the world around, lord's direction has you down"
"adolescent intellect, fearful of this crucifix"
is the bliss of what you gain worth a lifetime here in pain?
"couldn't deal what life has dealt, it's always blaming someone else"
"fool yourself, you think he cares"
"contradiction, it is there"
wither from the inside out
destiny with god in doubt
on the cross he died for sin
"look around, what did he win?"
preach your hell and you will see
you are your worst enemy
"the lord is dead, jesus, where have you gone?"
"retreat to greed, indeed, you are his son"
"prepare for death, confess, is it pretend?"
"killing yourselves for god, he is your friend?"
"all you life a testament, walking ornament of him"
"is forgiveness what you need, give in to hymn too easily"
"indecision you behold, live in torment as you're told"
sanctify this will of god by everything you've ever done
"will you ever know defeat, blinded by the agony"
"never sure of what you feel, the world you live in is not real"
"fool yourself, you think he cares"
contradiction it is there

i'm always on the run with my guitar and my old shoes
i'm movin' and i'm groovin' and i really got the
blues
i'm always havin' fun and i've got nothin' left to
lose
i never tune my guitar 'cause i like the way it
grooves
sitting in a sleazy bar i'm slowly goin' down
i ain't got no more money but i know you'll be around
early in the morning and the first kiss isn't far
i ain't got nothing better than my girl and my guitar
we're rockin' and we're rolling and we don't know what we do
we play so loud and out of tune i need a new tattoo
we don't give a damn-shit we five horsemen on the run
we only wanna go out there and have a lot of fun
sitting in a sleazy bar i'm slowly goin' down
i ain't got no more money but i know you'll be around
early in the morning and the first kiss isn't far
i ain't got nothing better than my girl and my guitar
take me through the night and i will always be with you
"feel me, touch me, hear me, yes i love the things we do"
love me and i show you just the way i love you too
we belong together and i never let you go
driving the the pouring rain
my heart's heavy filled with pain
i think of you and of what went wrong
i wonder how i can carry on...oh baby
like a coin in a wishing well
keeping secrets i can never tell
passing roads that lead to hell
as love is slowly dying
tell me why you said goodbye
and left me in the storm
i'll never know the reason why you're so cold
"always just a fool in love, blinded by your smile"
but in your eyes i saw the lying
i surrender - surrender to the state of heartache
a love pretender - only you can set me free
you left your burning chains around my soul
always just a fool in love
now i pray to the lord above
is there a way to stop the crying
i surrender - surrender to the state of heartache
a love pretender - since the day you went away
you left eternal pain inside my heart...ooh
tell me why you said goodbye
and left me in the storm
i'll never know the reason why you're so cold
i surrender...ooh

revenge!
follow me through the night
we are sisters of the light
we are daughters of sin
we are laughter in the wind
follow me through the night
we are sisters of the light
"we are wild, we are free"
through the darkness follow me!
i am here to break the silence and
i want you to be the voice of mine
follow me now
follow me through the night...
"you alone, you can let time stand still and"
you create the missing element
we're the fires of hell
we're the deep rough sea
we're the stormy air
we are we
we're the ashes of time
and we are banshee
"through the darkness, sisters,"
follow me!
follow me now
follow me through the night...
"(lyrics: araya, king; music: hanneman)"
cascaded darkness
walls close in on me.
nailed shut but my eyes still see.
severe anguish as my body evolves.
the pain of life after death it resolves.
lead: hanneman
"emptiness in twilight's rebirth,"
the faint sounds of shoveled earth.
madness growing as your mind dissolves.
merely secret in my dreams.
lead: king
"night grows cold, twilight's near,"
on the edge of madness the wounds are sheared.
"forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass"
no spared breath.
"imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode."
"dead soul,"
"stone cold,"
out into the night.
voices inside my head
hold me under.
voices oppress.
like roaring thunder.
an echo bouncing inside my brain.
"how much can i take of the pain,"
the pain!
"a war raging deep inside my head,"
a split decision that will end with me dead.
"you see the agony in my eyes,"
"protruding aimless,"
i think it's time to die.
lead: king
a cannibal's desire feeds the fire
that burns in your head.
lead: hanneman
"intense pain eats away at your brain,"
thorazine pumping through your veins.
lead: king
"death walks inside you,"
"smell death around you,"
"hell's evil spell takes a soul,"
hear the sound of the bell
counting off death tolls.
lead: king
"laughing as you eternally rot,"
searching for human flesh
and life's blood.
lead: hanneman
live undead.
there's never been any reason
or escape for the treason
you just think of a time far away
i feel your flame and your anguish
i know your plans and your last wish
you just can't face another day
"angel of mercy, take her to your homeland"
"angel of mercy, you can feel the signs,"
"it's the end, it's the end"
you've stood along the life line
you've played the fool for the last time
you just want the joy and the peace
you've heard all the laughter
you've seen what you're after
you just want the rest and the sleep
"angel of mercy, take her to your homeland"
"angel of mercy, you can feel the signs,"
"it's the end, it's the end"
"angel of mercy, angel of mercy"
[lead: stefan]
[solo: stefan]
you can hear the clock's tick
"as you scheme for your last fix,"
from a place you never will awake
i hear your cry into the night
i hear you die within my fright
but now you've saved your mistake
angel of mercy...
"angel of mercy, angel of mercy"
i'd sign - a contract with the devil
i've tried - for so very long
i'd die - to become immortal
that's why i sing this song
am i a wannabe? - have i no dignity.
who'd give up all my life.. to be
in the book of heavy metal.. metal!
in the book of heavy metal
in life - i have no religion
besides the heavy metal gods
wear nothing but black skin tight leather
my skin's clad with metal studs
am i a wannabe? - have i no dignity.
i give up all my life to be..
in the book of heavy metal.. metal!
in the book of heavy metal
"some twenty years ago, the goods put down there feet,"
"so firmly in to the ground that no man of sword nor pen,"
could ever chains the rules upon which
the very fundament of metal was made.
"read all about it, in the book of heavy metal"
"read all about it, in the manual"
"read all about it, in the book of heavy metal"
read all about it
"don't need no flashy house, no kids/car or ugly wife"
"the only thing i want, is what my parents don't"
"need no widescreen tv, no in all honesty"
the only thing i want to be (to be or not to be)
in the book of heavy metal - in life - metal!
in the book of heavy metal - to death - metal!
i've signed - a contract with the devil
i'd like to become a star
i'd die - to become immortal
that's why i play the guitar
all eyes see
such shattered scenes
of sorry surrender
"secrecy, an empire bleeds"
its fallen pretenders
fear the isolation
returning life it dies in the dark
the fear it yearns
the years they burn
all my dreams
a make believe
a sorry endeavour
self-esteems entire need
demolished forever
the fear it yearns
the years they burn
until the hour we adapt
until the hour we collapse
they will try to crush your spirit
everyday just trying to bear it
dire thoughts to escape this suffering
tear this pain away
with the blade in your wrist
something in you says you must resist
they are weak you are strong
accept this
you must take control
you are rising
the strength inside you
with your defiance you will not be broken
this torment
has its reasons
your defiance takes your spirit higher
parasites that try to hurt you
manipulate and strip your virtue
you are the master of yourself
they will never take away
smash through the wall of their hate
just pawns to insecurities
they decay in sorrow and rage
their malice fades away
you are rising
the strength inside you
with your defiance you will not be broken
this torment
has its reasons
your defiance takes your spirit higher
never falter
find your solace
rise! fight!
no more weakness!
rise! fight!
exile torment!
rise! fight!
wiping tears and blood from your face
rise above the cowards of disgrace
realize they're just as beaten
overcome the fear
you must know they can't break your soul
"you are strong, stronger than you know"
their power inside is fiction
oppressor is defied
you are rising
the strength inside you
with your defiance you will not be broken
this torment
has its reasons
your defiance takes your spirit higher
murdering wilderness teaming with life
cold blooded killers armed with mechanized knife
razor sharp blades slicing limb from limb
"when the motor is revving, let the cutting begin"
tooth picks from logs or pulp and paper
"raping a harvest, stealing from nature"
ravaging hillsides until nothing remains
"depleting oxygen, an industries pains"
the chainsaw
at the core an industry
that makes its money from society
give the people what they need
"take a forest, plant a seed"
"slice and dice, chemically treat"
over and over it will repeat
"oak, maple, birch, and pine"
the receding of the forest line
the chain of blades do spin round
taking trees to the ground
deadly cost to environment
watch just where your money's spent
supply demand is on the rise
self destruction in disguise
blades of steel that never stop
the cutting of another crop
the chainsaw
i'm trying hard to understand
i'm trying hard to do the things it takes to be a man
life's slipping away from me
it's not the way i thought it'd be
life's slipping away from me
it's not the way i thought it'd be
i'm trying hard to understand
and to know just who i am
i'm trying hard to get a break
or just to give a damn
i'm trying hard to get away
but i always seem to stay
i'm trying hard to understand
the fucking words you say
life's slipping away from me
it's not the way i thought it'd be
life's slipping away from me
it's not the way i thought it'd be
(away from me)
somebody help me
i'm in this mess and i'm slipping away
somebody help me
i'm in this mess and i'm slipping away
i'm trying hard to understand
but i don't know if i can
i'm trying hard to make the best
out of this mess i'm in
life's slipping away from me
it's not the way i thought it'd be
life's slipping away from me
it's not the way i thought it'd be
life's slipping away from me
i can't hold on
i can't believe it
life's slipping away from me
it's not the way i thought it'd be
somebody help me
i'm in this mess and i'm slipping away
somebody help me
i'm in this mess and i'm slipping away
i'm trying hard to understand
i fell from the sky
so don't ask me why
i'm feeling so down
watching the stars falling down from the sky in the night
crashing from out of the heavens they're burning so bright
"descend through the atmosphere, glowing with fiery light"
"dragging a tail of white sparkles, and oh, what a sight"
"oh, where did i go, how could i know"
defies all reason now
i fell from the sky
so don't ask me why
i'm feeling so down
"attacked, shot down and wrecked"
there's no turning back
to find my way home
"hey little alien, little grey"
where's the place your people stay
have you found a place beyond
where eternity moves on
"let me detach you, help me find"
what goes on in your captor's mind
for eternity awaits
on the brink of our escape
"we're twisting, we're turning"
"we're running, we're burning"
out on the run through the maze
on through the madness
no time for sadness
and no one can show us the way
through hangar 18
the tension now grows
we're getting so close
"enter the ship, start the engine and open the gates"
of hangar 18
"onwards to the sky, the stars are bright, they'll shine forever"
"on and on we fly, so far away"
hey little alien
what have they done to you
are there survivors here
or have they all just disappeared
i fell from the sky
so don't ask me why
i'm feeling so down
"attacked, shot down and wrecked"
was no turning back
to find my way home
"the dark, the fear of the night"
and the pain settles down deep within
coming home to a place still unknown
and the hope as i dream is undying
"when the sky falls, and the world you know comes crashing down"
"when the sky falls, and everything is changing"
"changes came across the sky, welcome to the other side"
and everything is changing
when the sky falls
when the sky falls
the majestic horns of baphomet
are indeed our occult banners proudly up in the air!
the androgenious light of lucipher
"is our noble passion, most dear and rare!"
oh! faustian spirit of conquest
may be thy allied in this infimious battle
against the arauts of desrespect
those who step with muddy feet the sapient inscriptions of our cradle.
to our strenghtening i proudly confess:
"i worship thee, for they are my weapons to hurt god."
oh! great wings of beelzebuth
will you honour me and lay the head
"of a son of caym, in the soft sands of manitou"
where i'll sleep under this neophyth sky of anxiety.
for the dawn of knowledge has a southern sign
delfos will once again desveil its light
and those with eyes will drink this precious wine
"but for the blind, ignorance shall be the only sight!"
to our strenghtening i will re-affirm:
i worship thee. they are my shield.
and their message i shall reveal.
"because: ""quod sciptum, scripsi!"""
and this southern blend of esoteric sapience
this sensual mediterranic philosophy
will be the only and holy science
and these lines both dream and prophecy!
"""ecce homo!"" - those you'll call the wise"
who will destroy this pitful hole of common sense
of desrespect for the true occult devise
"those who from, the lambs, shall feel the sharpened spears of intelligence!"
"i worship thee. ""quod sciptum, scripsi!"""
"i worship thee. ""consummatum est!"""

"lyrics : shane embury / music : mitch harris , shane embury"
"all this pain is a hate disease,"
intravened into my heart.
bittersweet emotional fall
choking dry the lifeline strong ?
a time stretched farce.
who do we fool ?
salacious thoughts
pulling at strings.
"intake decay,"
the vision burns.
"intake decay,"
stranger now.
feed on the lie
that kept it strong.
do we confess ?
admit our worth.
"i drown myself in my fears insecure,"
how can i trust passing time reassure ?
there's no more me.
"i drown myself in my fears insecure,"
how can i trust passing time reassure ?
"reclusive me, instigate, fence off blows."
forced to admit - realise how it goes.
"lest we forget scorched earth policies,"
"of megaton and hydrogen,"
"and taut muscle of an armory that flexes,"
to show the world we mean business!
"it's all smiles and handshakes,"
but who moves to disarm.
"radium, uranium -"
one more isotope to add the collection.
"that's gonna eat us even more,"
when there's ashes to remind us.
the age of outrage
has been reasoned into submission.
and cries for peace
are no longer in fashion.
i wonder if we'll see the point
through cataracted eyes.
"or draw breath from irradiated lungs,"
and sigh as we exit times seven.
made myself a prisoner
i locked myself away
can't remember the last time
i saw the light of day
don't want to face life
feel i've been betrayed
i want you tell me
where our love went astray
so can't you wait one more minute
why can't you wait one more day
let's get it straight
'cause it's a big mistake
we better think about it
i don't want to break it up
why do we have to break it up?
never ever want to break it up oh no
i only wanna make it up tonight
you say you've thought about it
but you sound so cold
you make it look like our love
can be bought or sold
you won't listen
you say it's way too late
that something is missing
and now you just can't wait
why can't you wait one more minute?
why can't you wait? give me one more day
let's get it straight
this is a big mistake
we better think about it
i don't want to break it up
why do we have to break it up?
never ever want to break it up
"ooh no, i only wanna make it up tonight"
"so don't say break it up, break it up"
"i wanna hear you say we'll make it up, make it up"
i don't want to break it up
"oh baby, why can't we make it up tonight?"
"make it up tonight, make it up tonight"
and i ask myself
what's wrong with me?
how could i be so blind?
i know she tried to give me everything
but i still couldn't see
now as i watch our love slip away
"i'm begging you, begging you, please"
"don't break it up, break it up"
"take a little time and make it up, make it up"
i don't want to break it up
"oh no, i only wanna make it up tonight"
don't want to break it up
baby let me make it up
"oh no no, no no"
"i, don't break it up, no no"
"tonight, make it up, make it up"
"ooh yeah, make it up, make it up"
ravens of death
calling my name
right out of hell
with an evil spell
there is no romance
only fire and screams
darkness rising
and killing your dreams
revelation has arrived
in the fire you will die
the reaper is back
with angels of black
hells bells hell funeral
the reaper's not dead
he's dead ahead
hells bells hell funeral
pounding sound
get down to the ground
into the blackness
where silence is dead
wafts of mist
cover the land
see my coach and coffin
be sure it's your end
the reaper has returned
a lesson they should learn
from darkness he will rise
he kills all the silent cries
the reaper has returned
all human life is burned
"anguish, fear and pain"
welcome to reaper's reign
"i was born by the river, just like this river"
i?ve been moving ever since
ain't got nobody to call my own
you know i?ve been moving since the day i was born
life is a game just made for fun
"you know i don't love nobody, i don't love no one"
"yes, i?m a mover, baby"
following the footsteps;
one fine day when i asked the wise man
which was the way he said:
"""follow your heart and look for yourself and come"
"back and tell me what you have learned"""
"went back and told him, i found me a wife"
eleven children and a real good life
told him of love and there's a happy home
but i need to return to that long winding road
"yes, i?m a mover, baby"
gotta move on down
mmmmove on
fallen souls in fields afar
eternal hearts of fire
rows and rows of endless ghosts
their memories inspire
dreams of glory dreams of war
a generation died
through the trenches
hear their songs
and wear their badge with pride
stand up and fight
march at first light
into the great battle we ride
onwards tonight
wait for the strike
brothers in arms we unite
guardians of heaven
in the night skies together
remembered forever
through the centuries of time
honour and glory
we salute you the fallen
united we stand
the hearts of great men
we'll raise our flag high
for the heroes lost in time
photographs of sons long gone
a dusty picture frame
crosses stand on foreign lands
their memories never fade
fields now green which once were scarred
a million warriors lay
hear the stories gone untold
on this remembrance day
stand up and fight
march at first light
into the great battle we ride
onwards tonight
wait for the strike
brothers in arms we unite
guardians of heaven
in the night skies together
remembered forever
through the centuries of time
honour and glory
we salute you the fallen
united we stand
the hearts of great men
we'll raise our flag high
for the heroes lost in time
"for the king, for our queen"
for the glory of our great country
"over land, on the sea"
"for our homeland we fight, fight to be free"
guardians of heaven
in the night skies together
remembered forever
through the centuries of time
honour and glory
we salute you the fallen
united we stand
the hearts of great men
we'll raise our flag high
for the heroes lost in time
heroes lost in time
heroes lost in time
heroes lost in time
i can't wait much longer
revenge is overdue
you took your chance and screwed me
way back in '82
inside my hate is burning
my brain's on overload
my innocence is over
now i'm ready to explode
i'm gonna be your nemesis - i like it when you scream
i'm the mother of your nightmares - got a contract to redeem
this one's for you - right in your face
just sit on this and spin around
this one's for you - your time is up
stick it - shove it - where the sun don't shine
you've always been a wise guy
you played at being rough
i stripped away your masquerade
and now you ain't so tough
you're a coward with no backbone
i will crush you with my heel
put the scrapings in my blender
add some bourbon - what a meal
i'm gonna be your nemesis - i like it when you scream
i'm the mother of your nightmares - got a contract to redeem
this one's for you - right in your face
just sit on this and spin around
this one's for you - i hold the ace
stick it - shove it
this one's for you - right in your face
just sit on this and spin around
this one's for you - a bunch of fives
stick it - shove it
this one's for you - right in your face
just sit on this and spin around
this one's for you -no one but you
stick it - shove it - where the sun don't shine
i hear you talking your shit
wondering if it's ever going to end
your bored all the time with the things that you do
i don't pity your life
i see your acting all weird
it all seems so clear
your making no sense in a world so immense
stop wasting my time
always judging a face
what the fuck is wrong with you
sucking out the life of anyone that you can reach
a mind so sick
blood sucking leech
life taking leech
blood...
blood sucking leech
life wasting leech
blood sucking leech
life wasting leech
ask yourself where you're
heading for.
deviate - no need
to conform.
all it takes is some
confidence.
"seize the day, it might not"
come again.
only the strong will survive
stand tall and never say die
come out from where you hide
no need to swallow your pride
only the strong will survive
get up and reach for the sky
don't wait for no-one and
don't let your heart be denied
face the truth and
control your fate.
set the pace
never hesitate.
all that scares you and
makes you doubt
"break the silence, just"
spit it out.
"ride, ride, ride, ride up from hell"
armed with magic sons of demons and men
this song of greeting written for your tragic end.
so long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
black winds blow where we ride near.
"maim and kill them, take the women and children."
hot pitch and chain take to the air
our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
"steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield."
their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
"maim and kill them, take the women and children."
fallen brother as i hold closed your side
i fear this wound your last.
mighty earth now doth drink your blood
and i remember days long past.
"your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep"
"for you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet."
"for when we march, your sword rides with me."
"for when we march, your sword rides with me."
"for when we march, your sword rides with me."
"for when we march, your sword rides with me."
you who killed my brother and all who take your side
this be your last hour. let your steel be tried.
now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
kill me if you can.
death is life!
by the full moon they rise from their graves.
"through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage."
"swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood"
"we are one, we know not fear! born to fight not run."
"maim and kill them, take the women and children."
no longer i roam on the shores that i love
the ship that i am sailing is lost at sea
lord knows i long for the blue skies above
"you know, home is where the heart is"
why can't you see?
but now they are asking questions
so be careful for what you say
"""step into room sixteen, sir"""
please come right this way
because you are in exile
exile no!
i cannot believe they are wasting my time
please tell me what is happening
cause i don't have a clue
it's so hard to conceive that i'm still
standing in line
"i'm feeling so lonely, i could cry the blues"
but then there is a ray of hope somewhere
at least that's what they always say
"again ""step into room sixteen, sir"""
because you are in exile
exile no!
your light shined out bright
shined out for all to see
but it really only shines for only me
and when the day runs out of light
we feel each other
our love is burning bright
sunlit nights
your love is burning away
brighter everyday
sunlit nights
feel my love goin' up in flames
warms with a touch
you know just what to do
sparks me with a fever
that burns me all night through
bring on the heat
turn out the light
we will be melting
melting down tonight
sunlit nights
your love is burning away
brighter everyday
sunlit nights
feel my love goin' up in flames
all through the day
i try and keep it cool
but all my day dreamin'
brings me back to you
(and our)
sunlit nights
your love is burning away
brighter everyday
sunlit nights
feel my love goin' up in flames
sunlit nights
your love is burning away
brighter everyday
sunlit nights
feel my love goin' up in flames
an empty gaze reflects the contradiction
"alleged strength, so fragile"
no more than compassion
ephemeral gatherings without interaction
be sincere and announce your departure
a vallum of fairy tales smashed into reality
projected on the ruins of a castle in the air
say - to where do we belong
say - how far did we come
it seems to me we all agree
humanity can rest in peace
too bad but love is dead
"hey, who wakes the world"
when there's no one that will hear
i'm kneeling in front of the altar
satan's cross upon the wall
"strange emptiness, a crystal ball between two candles"
melissa has entered another life
"melissa, you were mine"
"melissa, you were the light"
she was a witch
why did they take you away?
"melissa, you were the queen of the night"
"melissa, you were my light"
i swear revenge on the priest
the priest must die
he must die in the name of hell
"melissa, can you hear me?"
"melissa, are you there?"
nothing is left outside at the stake
they take her far away
from me
(i think melissa's still with us)
no flickering light at the end of the path
confront repressions of the past
fear... prevail... insanity... obey!
draw back in silence to dwell in anxiety
"no matter where i am, i'm alone"
my dreams are shattered
into thousand running tears
"the tears keep dripping down, down,"
"deep, down from my veins"
i'm walking towards dead end i'm walking all alone
two steps behind insanity
there's no starlight guiding my way throught this downward death row
soon will be the time i have to go...
little by little the end is drawing near
another night and so little blood to spare
(ya can hurt me... but ya can't possess me 'y know...)
"kill me, hurt me, fuck me, rape me, you won't have me!"
"draw back in silence to dwell in anxiety,"
"no matter where i am, i'm alone. i'm crying outloud"
"the tears of blood i bleed, so fuck the world,"
"i'll go now, i don't care. (who cares?)"
"i'm walking towards dead end, and i'm walking all alone"
two steps ago i past insanity
there's no starlight guiding my way out this downward death row
so now is the time i have to go
"""leaving you for me"""
"album: ""so what"" (2005)"
i´m sitting here alone
what else could i have done?
i can´t regret ´cause
i don´t even know what i did wrong
freedom died with you
i´m searching for myself
when i feel alive
(what about me?)
leaving you for me (what about us?)
try to understand
that i´m only leaving you for me
i try to hold back
deep inside my head
it won´t let go
hiding from the truth
his strange been
through his thoughts
i can't let go exploring
every corner of his soul
life has to go on
you still find your way
or i feel alive
(what about me?)
i've locked the door
deep inside
different memories
lost what counts
"deep inside,"
different stories...
(what about me?)
leaving you for me
(what about us?)
try to understand
that i´m only leaving you for me
i try to hold back
deep inside my head
it won´t let go
i see a special magic
it's in my mind
a place where god is healing
and the devil's running blind
and washed away is sorrow
he flooded every soul
embraced the world in glory
and took away the cold
they all could see him rise
up to the angels that waited in the sky
surrender did you and i
but it's all in fantasy
my visions not real
in a time of jealousy
there's no truth to reveal
surrounded by madness
in a wolrd without hope
we're led by destruction
captured as our souls
i feel a special sadness
it's in my life
stung by a thousand spears
and coloured by the night
they all would watch him die
and everyone there just turned a blind eye
he surrendered for you and i
all it's all in fantasy
my visions so real
no more lies or jealousy
only love shall reveal
surrounded by happines
in a world full of joy
no more wars to be ended
released as our souls
mailbox full of bills to pay
get up - get out and save your day
all the girls with barbie curls
where's the boy with wooden toys
they are surfing the net
remembering that day
i see my body below me
sighs rend the air
night will it find the day
or will i slumber for eternity
there's a knocking at the gates
the darkness is calling me
how will i know what awaits?
pulled through these hollowed halls
the light in the distance
as my spirit falls
i must not leave this world
but i lost my resistance
heaven held before me
i can see the fires are churning
is this really how it has to be?
parting visions in my head
calling out your name
it screams to be heard
voices in my head
parting visions in my head
calling out your name
it screams to be heard
holy diver
you've been down too long in the midnight sea
"oh, what's becoming of me"
ride the tiger
you can see his stripes but you know he's clean
"oh, don't you see what i mean"
gotta get away !
holy diver !
shiny diamonds
like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
something is coming for you
race for the morning
you can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
"oh, we will pray it's all right"
gotta get away !
get away !
between the velvet lies
there's a truth that's hard as steel
the vision never dies
life's a never ending wheel
holy diver
you're the star of the masquerade
no need to look so afraid
jump on the tiger
you can feel his heart but you know he's mean
some light can never be seen
holy diver
you've been down too long in the midnight sea
"oh, what's becoming of me"
ride the tiger
you can see his stripes but you know he's clean
"oh, don't you see what i mean"
gotta get away !
get away !
gotta get away !
get away !
holy diver !
soul surviver !
you're screaming
holy diver ! x 4
never came in the middle coming to you !
holy diver ! x 2
get away ! x 3
get out !

the songwriter's dead
the blade fell upon him
taking him to the white lands
of empathica
of innocence

innocence
"""home"""
the dreamer and the wine
poet without a rhyme
a widowed writer torn apart by chains of hell
is still the same old song
oh christ how i hate what i have become
take me home
"getaway, runaway, fly away"
lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
i cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
"i cannot die, i, a whore for the cold world"
forgive me
i have but two faces
one for the world
one for god
save me
i cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
"i cannot die, i, a whore for the cold world"
my home was there 'n then
those meadows of heaven
adventure-filled days
one with every smiling face
"please, no more words"
thoughts from a severed head
no more praise
tell me once my heart goes right
take me home
"getaway, runaway, fly away"
lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
i cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
"i cannot die, i, a whore for the cold world"
forgive me
i have but two faces
one for the world
one for god
save me
i cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
"i cannot die, i, a whore for the cold world"
"""the pacific"""
sparkle my scenery
with turquoise waterfall
with beauty underneath
the ever free
tuck me in beneath the blue
"beneath the pain, beneath the rain"
goodnight kiss for a child in time
swaying blade my lullaby
on the shore we sat and hoped
under the same pale moon
whose guiding light chose you
chose you all
"""i'm afraid. i'm so afraid"
"being raped again, and again, and again"
i know i will die alone
but loved
you live long enough to hear the sound of guns
long enough to find yourself screaming every night
long enough to see your friends betray you
for years i've been strapped unto this altar
now i only have 3 minutes and counting
i just wish the tide would catch me first
"and give me a death i always longed for """
"""dark passion play"""
2nd robber to the right of christ
cut in half - infanticide
the world will rejoice today
as the crows feast on the rotting poet
everyone must bury their own
no pack to bury the heart of stone
"now he's home in hell, serves him well"
"slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell"
"the morning dawned, upon his altar"
remains of the dark passion play
performed by his friends without shame
spitting on his grave as they came
"getaway, runaway, fly away"
lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
i cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
"i cannot die, i, a whore for the cold world"
forgive me
i have but two faces
one for the world
one for god
save me
i cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
"i cannot die, i, a whore for the cold world"
"""today, in the year of our lord 2005"

"and 1000 pages of erased text. """

"be still, my son"
you're home
oh when did you become so cold?
the blade will keep on descending
all you need is to feel my love
"search for beauty, find your shore"
"try to save them all, bleed no more"
you have such oceans within
in the end
i will always love you

i step off the train
i'm walkin' down your street again
and pass your door
but you don't live there anymore
it's years since you've been there
and now you've disappeared somewhere
like outer space
you've found some better place
and i miss you
like the deserts miss the rain
and i miss you
like the deserts miss the rain
could you be dead?
you always were two steps ahead
of everyone
we'd walk behind while you would run
i look up at your house
i can almost hear you shout
down to me
where i always used to be
i step off the train
i'm walkin' down your street again
and pass your door
but you don't live there anymore
it's years since you've been there
but now you've disappeared somewhere
like outer space
you've found some better place
and i miss you
and i miss you
like the deserts miss the rain
and i miss you
like the deserts miss the rain
and i miss you
(like the deserts miss the rain)
like the deserts miss the rain
and i miss you
(like the deserts miss the rain)
like the deserts miss the rain

when i say rise up
when i say war
that means the time is now
to even up the score
the leader speaks
his plan has failed before
enlisted soldiers
awaiting orders
it's time for justice
just like before
our troops protect and serve
are they ever coming home
so much regret
another killed by war
such a tragedy
enlisted soldiers
obey their orders
when i say rise up
you say war
when i say rise up
you say war!
rise up... war!
rise up... war!
rise up... war!
rise up... war!
the smell of death
reeks through the air
the stench of burning bodies
bloodshed everywhere
scattered remains
and bullet shells
send in the dogs of war
unleash the hounds of hell
it's time to rise up!
it's time to rise for war!
it's time to rise up!
black is death!
and red is war!
yeah i said rise up
