well you asked me to tell you about her
since we have been friends for so long
well she's really an outstanding woman
more precious than any i've known
she's soft she's kind and she's gentle
she likes to be loved tenderly
she's the kind you won't ever get over
and she should belong to me
don't leave her at night she'll be frightened
she's afraid when the darkness sets in
and blue is her favorite color
and she prefers home loving men
she likes roses on special occasion
champagne makes her laugh and feel free
she wants to be held when she's lonely
and she should belong to me
she should be here with me in these two arms of mine
happy like we used to be
she no longer needs me i've run out of time
oh she should belong to me
oh she should belong to me
you’re a single mom with three kids
and just as many jobs
your candle burns at both ends
but you can’t make it stop
you’re a farmer on a john deere
honest work for little pay
throw that thing in park
it’s time to play…
like it’s midnight in vegas
mardi gras in new orleans
new year’s eve in new york city
you know what i mean
it’s like lovers in paris
sunset strip in l.a.
doesn’t matter where you are
"well, it’s alright,"
it’s alright to play
"oh, yes it is"
where there ain’t no drugs or doctors
who can get you what you need
i’ve got the got the magic potion
and it doesn’t cost a thing
"yeah, you’ve seen some hard times"
life just works out that way
but when you’re smack dab in the middle
you gotta play…
like it’s midnight in vegas
mardi gras in new orleans
new year’s eve in new york city
you know what i mean
it’s like lovers in paris
sunset strip in l.a.
doesn’t matter where you are
"well, it’s alright,"
it’s alright to play
"hey, hey"
like a kiss in the moonlight
barefoot walks on the beach
like sipping champagne straight from a bottle
you know what i mean…
like it’s midnight in vegas
mardi gras in new orleans
new year’s eve in new york city
you know what i mean
like lovers in paris
sunset strip in l.a.
doesn’t matter where you are
"well, it’s alright,"
it’s alright to play
"(it’s alright to play, it’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright to play)"
"c’mon, c’mon, c’mon,"
"(yeah, it’s alright, it’s alright)"
"(it’s alright to play, it’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright to play)"
it’s alright to play
"(it’s alright to play, it’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright to play)"
"(yeah, it’s alright, it’s alright)"
"well, it’s alright to play (it’s alright, it’s alright)"
"yeah, it’s alright to play"
"yeah, it’s alright to play"
"(yeah, it’s alright, it’s alright)"
"well, it’s alright, it’s alright"
"well, it’s alright, it’s alright"
"it’s alright, yeah"
i'm for the law and order the way it should be
this song's about the night they spent protecting you from me
someone called us outlaws in some old magazine
and new york sent a posse down like i ain't ever seen
don't you think this outlaw bit's done got out of hand
what started out to be a joke the law don't understand
was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man
maybe this here outlaw bit's done got out of hand out of hand
[ guitar ]
we were wrapped up in our music that's why we never saw
the car pulls up the boys get out and the room fills up with law
they came boundin' through the backdoor in the middle of a song
they got me for possession for something that was gone long gone
don't you think this outlaw...
don't you think this outlaw bit's done got out of hand
all alone at the end of the evening and the bright lights have faded to blue
i was thinkin' about a woman who might have loved me and i never knew
you know i've always been a dreamer spent my life running round
and it's so hard to change can't seem to settle down
but the dreams i've seen lately
keep on turnin' out and burnin' out and turnin' out the same
so put me on a highway and show me a sign and take it to the limit one more time
[ piano ]
you can spend all your time making money you can spend all your love making time
if it all fell to pieces tomorrow would you still be mine
and when you're looking for more freedom when nobody seems to care
and you can't find the door well you can't find it anywhere
when there's nothin' to believe in
still you're coming back you're running back
you're coming back for more
so put me on the highway and show me a sign and take it to the limit one more time
take it to the limit take it to the limit take it to the limit one more time
well the road was hot and flat as a ruler
good hundred miles between me and medulla
that violet top wasn't gettin' no cooler
i stopped at a quickie sack
well i figured i'd need about a sixth of miller
and one of those things so i wouldn't spill 'er
i asked the girl if the beer was in the back
she said
it's a dry town
"no beer, no liquor for miles around"
i'd give a nickel for a sip or two
to wash me down
outta this dry town
"so i turn right around, no hesitation"
cursed the law for ruinin' the nation
waved goodbye to the boy at the station
but she wouldn't go in gear
he said it sounds like your transmission
"you need bob, but he's gone fishin'"
"his day off, he gets a long way from here"
cause
it's a dry town
"no beer, no liquor for miles around"
i'd give a nickel for a sip or two
to wash me down
outta this dry town
well if i call a friend you can get a dose of
something strong from your local grocer
so i walked down til i got a little closer
to a place called happy jars
he said i keep something here for colds and fevers
down underneath where i usual leave her
just last night i felt a cold comin on
it's a dry town
"no beer, no liquor for miles around"
i'd give a nickel for a sip or two
to wash me down
outta this dry town
there's a campfire burning on the missippi river bank
my old pickup speakers are cranking out alot of hank
that's the sheriff's daughter dancin' on my hood
with an empty bottle this can't be good.
there's an unwritten law in this sleepy little town
there ain't no drinkin on the river when the sun goes down
think i see the blue lights comin' through the woods
"its the sheriff and his posse, this can't be good"
everybody is runnin' like the end of the world is comin'
with a buffard t kinda law man closin' in
she just keeps on rockin guess i better do some talkin
she's too dumb to run n' i'm too drunk to swim
"this can't be good, this can't be good, this can't be good"
aww stay tuned...
this ol' haybarn's full of last years grass
i got a whole tin can full of campfire gas
theres a little bitty flame on this piece of firewood
and when it all comes together it can't be good
everybody is runnin like the end of the world was comin
with a wildfire burnin' like a freight train outta control
"she just keeps on rockin', babe there ain't no time for talking"
throw her over my shoulder run with everything i can
hold on babe looks like were jumpin in...
"now you know, when we get to the other side, were gonna have to take all"
"these wet clothes off, and hang out awhile... you know, this could be good."
yea!
there's a saying old
says that love is blind
still we're often told
"""seek and ye shall find"""
so i'm going to seek
a certain lad
i've had in mind
looking everywhere
haven't found him yet
he's the big affair
i cannot forget
only man i ever think
of with regret
i'd like
to add his inital
to my monogram
tell me
where is the shepherd
for this lost lamb?
there's a somebody
i'm longin' to see
i hope that he turns
out to be
someone to watch over me
i'm a little lamb
who's lost in the wood
i know i could
always be good
to one
who'll watch over me
although he may
not be the man some
girls think
of as handsome
to my heart
he carries the key
won't you tell him please
to put on some speed
follow my lead
"oh, how i need"
someone to watch over me
won't you tell him please
to put on some speed
follow my lead
"oh, how i need"
someone to watch over me
someone to watch over me
"his fastball is fading, his sinker is gone,"
"they sent him doun to the minors 'cause he wore out his arm,"
but his eyes shine brighter than the young kids' it seems
"so he keeps on playing, holding on to the dream."
lord knows that it ain't for the money
"cause he's broke almost every day,"
and it ain't for the fame or the glory
guess he'll do it cause he still loves to play
guess he'll do it cause he still loves to play.
he's been in the saddle since he was a kid
the rodeo came but he keeps it well hid
and someday he'll have to set his pony free
but 'til he does he'll be riding the dream.
"lord knows that it ain't for the money,"
"'cause he's broke almost every day,"
and it ain't for the fame or the glory
guess he'll do it cause he still loves to play;
"guess he'll do it, cause he still loves to play."
we ain't getting no younger and that is the truth
"but these games we keep playin,' they're our fountain of youth."
from boston to boulder and down to orleans
from highlights to lowlife and everything in between
well i guess we could grow up and quit wearing our jeans
but we still feel like playing and living the dream.
"lord knows that it ain't for the money,"
"'cause he's broke almost every day,"
and it ain't for the fame or the glory
guess he'll do it cause he still loves to play;
"guess he'll do it, cause he still loves to play."
"he saw her after school, sippin on a coke"
"acted like a fool, crackin crazy jokes"
"she turned his motor on, man his heart was gone"
"fire down below, easy as you go"
"easy as you go, steady as you fly"
"keep it in the road, keep an eagle eye"
"turn it on a dime, man you never know"
"take a little time, whoa easy as you go"
"graduation night, out behind the stands"
"in the fading light, he became a man"
she discovered love better be enough
"cause baby's gonna grow, easy as you go"
"easy as you go, steady as you fly"
"keep it in the road, keep an eagle eye"
"turn it on a dime, man you never know"
"take a little time, whoa easy as you go"
"judgemental frowns, teacher's lookin down"
"parents all ashamed, passin out the blame"
"they got a little room, service station view"
"the rents too high, pays to low whoa"
easy as you go
there ain’t nothing like a daughter or a son
to make a mama old and keep a daddy young
"make a body dream, and give a life a theme"
take the highs and the lows whoa
easy as you go
"said the night wind to the little lamb,"
"""do you see what i see? do you see what i see?"
"way up in the sky, little lamb,"
do you see what i see? do you see what i see?
"a star, a star, dancing in the night"
"with a tail as big as a kite,"
"with a tail as big as a kite."""
"said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,"
"""do you hear what i hear? do you hear what i hear?"
"ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,"
do you hear what i hear? do you hear what i hear?
"a song, a song, high above the trees"
"with a voice as big as the sea,"
"with a voice as big as the sea."""
"said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,"
"""do you know what i know? do you know what i know?"
"in your palace warm, mighty king,"
do you know what i know? do you know what i know?
"a child, a child shivers in the cold--"
"let us bring him silver and gold,"
"let us bring him silver and gold."""
"said the king to the people everywhere,"
"""listen to what i say! listen to what i say!"
"pray for peace, people, everywhere,"

"he will bring us goodness and light,"
"he will bring us goodness and light."""

"you've got this confidence, yeah it was obvious"
the way you walked in here
you look sensational and totally capable
of buying your own beer
but you shouldn't have to
you shouldn't have to
i hate to think about everything you've done without
or how it's been before
you've ever walked home alone or sat and waited by the phone
or opened your own door
you shouldn't have to
you shouldn't have to
do you ever wonder when your dreams will come true
a girl like you can do anything
but anything you don't wanna do
you shouldn't have to
you shouldn't have to
you ever long for a back rub
all alone in your bathtub
need your glass of wine topped off
"but you have to get out and dry off, aw"
you shouldn't have to
you shouldn't have to
do you ever wonder when your dreams will come true
a girl like you can do anything
but anything you don't wanna do
like wash your own car or bait your own hook
"get all made up, wonder how you look"
"make your own breakfast, make the first move"
feel like you ain't being listened to
"kill your own spiders, change a flat tire"
"stoke your own fire, mow your own grass"
"pump your own gas, ever feel pain"
wish you had a ring on your hand
feel like anything less than the best-lookin' thing this town's ever seen
have a dress you'd love to wear but you gotta wait
'cause there ain't nobody there to help you zip the thing
you shouldn't have to
you shouldn't have to
you shouldn't have to
"when my little girl gets that sleep in her eyes,"
"and she settles in with her head on my chest,"
why do i feel like my heart's gonna burst?
that i'm willing to die for this angel at rest?
"and why am i filled with unshakeable faith,"
when i look at that child so fragile and sweet?
"there's something eternal i see in her face,"
something much more than her mother and me.
maybe i'm looking at the face of god.
"makes me think i may be looking at the face of god,"
and he's smiling back at me.
"why do i feel like the smallest of things,"
when i try to count all the stars in the sky?
"when i see the world that we're in at it's worst,"
why do i feel like it'll all be all right?
i can't see the wind as it moves through the trees.
"so how do i know that i know that i know,"
that somebody out there is speaking to me?
"saying: ""i love you and you're not alone."""
maybe i'm looking at the face of god.
"makes me think i may be looking at the face of god,"
and he's smiling back at me.
"oh, i know that i know that i know that he's out there."
somebody’s out there.
"when i look at the beauty around me,"
and the love that surrounds me.
maybe i'm looking at the face of god.
"makes me think i may be looking at the face of god,"
and he's smiling back at me.
maybe i'm looking at the face of god.
and he's smiling back at me.
that cold north wind is blowing grey eyes you know
the years are quickly going grey eyes you know
and the good life i promised you so long ago
is dead but for a dreaming grey eyes you know
we never had much money grey eyes you know
more rainy days than sunny grey eyes you know
and life has been a long hard road to hoe
but you stuck right by me smiling grey eyes you know
hard times took the blue from your eyes
leaving them grey as the winter's skies
we've had our talk now i must walk away
leave you here beneath this mound of clay
and i feel so empty as i turn to go
for my heart lies there beside you grey eyes you know
my heart lies there beside you grey eyes you know
"i like candy, i like cake, i like jam but goodness sake"
there's nothin' as sweet as my baby
"golden hair and big, blue eyes she could win a beauty prize"
there's nothin' as sweet as my baby
if i ever lose her i'll lay me down and die
if sugar seems sweet then you ought to meet
my honey coated sweetie pie
"i like candy, i like cake, i like jam but goodness sake"
there's nothin' as sweet as my baby
"i like candy, i like cake, i like jam but goodness sake"
there's nothin' as sweet as my baby
i feel like a honey bee when she's buzzing 'round with me
there's nothin' as sweet as my baby
got pounds of candy kisses but i can't spare an ounce
"she's sweeter than wine and brother, she's mine"
and that's the only thing that counts
"i like candy, i like cake, i like jam but goodness sakes"
there's nothin' as sweet as my baby
well i first kissed you on a hollow log
down by the river they call the dog
we fell in love and we vowed that day
like the flow of the river our love won't change
well we married that spring and we built a house
on the bank of the river where the rock juts out
now the river? still here but you're long gone
you left me and the river here all alone
i got the dog river blues
i?e walked holes in both my shoes
now i still got the river but i ain't got you
i got the dog river blues
well the rain came down and the river rose up
filled up the cab on my pickup truck
it came in the house and down the hall
and washed your picture right off the wall
well my heart still yearns and the river still rolls
and i pray someday it'll bring you home
so if you change your mind honey i'll be here
waiting on the banks of that olddog river
in the twilight glow i see her
blue eyes crying in the rain
when we kissed goodbye and parted
i knew we'd never meet again
love is like a dying ember
only memories remain
through the ages i remember
blue eyes crying in the rain
someday when we meet up yonder
we'll stroll hand in hand again
in a land that knows no parting
blue eyes crying in the rain
blue eyes crying in the rain
blue eyes crying in the rain
blue eyes crying in the rain
you tell me today that you're leaving
but just think a while
i'm sure that you must know
today might be the day that you walk away
"but you left me a long, long time ago."
today's just the day that ends it all
except the usual mem'ries
that always lingers on
and today might be the day that you walk away
"but you left me a long, long time ago."
i stood with helpless hands
and watched me lose your love
a little more each day
then it was gone
and i kept wond'rin'
just how long until this day would come
how long could your pride keep hangin' on.
so please don't say you're sorry
don't say anything
don't try to say why you must leave
just go
and today might be the day that you walk away
"but you left me a long, long time ago."
"you left me a long, long time ago"
flattop guitar
down around the campfire

and wash out all the lipstick stains once more
pretend i don't know about those bad things you do
what i go thru to keep holding on to you
pretend that i'm asleep when you come in
so i won't have to ask you where you've been
cause i'm afraid you'd tell me what i didn't want is true
what i go thru to keep holding on to you
everybody wonders why i make it and even you must wonder why i take it
but everytime you step across that line
my crazy heart knows maybe it's the last time
i've learned to hide my hurt behind a smile
and hoped that you'll be true for just a while
but all the time i know you'll do just what you want to do
what i go thru to keep holding on to you
what i go thru to keep holding on to you
whatcha gonna do when the show is over?
whatcha gonna sing when the song ends?

where you gonna reach when the goals get higher?
how are you gonna make it through
when you think you lost your chance

counted the stars on the 4th of july
wishing we were rockets bursting in the sky
talking about redemption and leaving things behind
as the sun sank west on the mendocino county line
as fierce as monday morning feeling washed away
"i orchestrated paradise, couldn’t make you stay"
you dance with the horses through the sands of time
as the sun sinks west on the mendocino county line
i have these pictures and i keep these photographs
to remind me of a time
these pictures and these photographs
let me know i’m doin’ fine
i used to make you happy once upon a time
but the sun sank west on the mendocino county line
the two of us together felt nothin’ but right
feeling near immortal every friday night
"lost in our convictions, left stained with wine"
as the sun sank west on the mendocino county line
i have these pictures and i keep these photographs
to remind me of a time
these pictures and these photographs
let me know i’m doin’ fine
i used to make you happy once upon a time
but the sun sank west on the mendocino county line
i don’t talk to you too much these days
i just thank the lord pictures don’t fade
i spent time with an angel just passing through
now all that’s left is this image of you
counted the stars on the 4th of july
wishing we were rockets bursting in the sky
talking about redemption and leaving things behind
i have these pictures and i keep these photographs
to remind me of a time
these pictures and these photographs
let me know i’m doin’ fine
we used to be so happy once upon a time
once upon a time
but the sun sank west on the mendocino county line
and the sun sank west on the mendocino county line
tuesday night crowded bar
some guy lights a cheap cigar
bartender yells at him
so he walks out and you walk in
right through the cloud of smoke
catcalls and dirty jokes
scan the room a couple times
find a seat right next to mine
lonely eyes
"well, it sure looks like"
you just might
be looking for something
"for something, whoa"
look at me
and i think you'll see
those lonely eyes
don't have to be alone tonight
they analyze your glass of wine
roll away a pickup line
now and then they check your phone
catch mine and let 'em go
from the little bit i've seen
they're the perfect shade of green
next time they come my way
heaven don't make 'em stay
don't make me pay my tab
catch a cab
go home and kick myself to sleep tonight
gimme a sign
just a smile
"baby, i'll be glad to lose myself deep inside"
lonely eyes
lonely eyes
sure looks like
you just might
be looking for something
"for something, whoa"
look at me
and i'll think you'll see
those lonely eyes
they don't have to be alone tonight
"lonely eyes, you don't have to be alone tonight"
"now and then, here and there, i still see you"
"and sometimes my memory lets me hear your voice, so soft and low"
"but like the wind you travel in, you seem to come and go"
"at times, my mind is crystal clear"
and then i think of you
then the spin of the room i'm in
brings you into view
love that once
held my mind completely in control
now makes it spin like tornado wind
as it comes and goes
"well, look who's here"
i told myself that you'd be coming soon
i hope that you can stay for a little while
it's so lonesome in this room
and you look just the same today
do you still love me so?
"what's that you say, you can't stay?"
you seem to come and go
at times my mind is crystal clear
and then i think of you
then the spin of the room i'm in
brings you into view
love that once
held my mind completely in control
now makes it spin like tornado winds
as it comes and goes
i'm going home to magic valley where hay turns into rose
i'm going home to magic valley leaving for my home above
now don't you cry because i'm leaving for you see i've had my day
i've led the life that's not for grieving so rejoice with me and pray
for i hear my lord telling me put down that heavy load
you'll reach your gold now follow me come on up the golden road
for i hear my lord telling me...
if i'm not in love with you
"what is this i'm going through, tonight"
and if my heart is lying then
what should i believe in
why do i go crazy
every time i think about you baby
why else do i want you like i do
if i'm not in love with you
and if i don't need your touch
"why do i miss you so much, tonight"
if it's just infatuation then
why is my heart achin'
to hold you forever
give a part of me i thought i'd never
give again to someone i could lose
if i'm not in love with you
oh why in every fantasy
do i feel your arms embracing me
lovers lost in sweet desire
oh why in dreams do i surrender
like a little baby
someone help explain this feeling
someone tell me
if i'm not in love with you
"what is this i'm going through, tonight"
and if my heart is lying then
what i should believe in
why do i go crazy
every time i think about you baby
"why else do i want you like i, i do"
if i'm not in love with you
been wound up tighter than a banjo string
price of gas groceries and all those things
they sound little till you add 'em all up
then you really feel the crunch.
"man, i've had enough."
"i need to chill, give it a rest"
get down to the lake with a full ice chest
"and chill, and let a cold corona"
lift this world right off my shoulders
"climb in the water, steak on the grill"
i think its way past time for me to chill
just chill.
this morning 65 was a parking lot
bumper to bumper just start and stop
sometimes i think we're like a bunch of rats
getting caught in our own traps
"well, i say to hell with that."
i need to chill give it a rest
get down to the lake with a full ice chest
"and chill, and let a cold corona"
lift this world right off my shoulders
"climb in the water, steak on the grill"
i think its way past time for me to chill
just chill.
before we go to therapy and take another pill
"we just need to chill, give it a rest"
lay down in a hammock and take a deep breath
"and chill, it don't cost a dime"
to reel in your troubles and just unwind
cork in the water and time to kill
you can't tell me this ain't a great way to chill
just chill
"man, i need to chill."
just chill.
i've been wondering if i was more like water
"would i still find, a place to hide?"
'cause i don't want to stay here hidin' in my corner
"if i was more like water, i'd surround you like the tide"
would i cry for you?
would i freeze over?
would i slip through the cracks unnoticed?
or crash into you? crash into you
"when i feel like a storm is on its way, and my skies are turning grey"
"i know that i can take it, as long as i can face it"
"your love like shelter from the rain, and that touch i can't explain"
"i know that i can take it, as long as i can face it, with you"
"as long as i can face it, with you (you, ooh-ooh, ooh)"
i can see so clearly standing on your shoulders
"it takes more than me, it takes you, baby"
let the days turn into years as we grow older
will you run with me?
even if we don't know where we're going?
"when i feel like a storm is on its way, and my skies are turning grey"
"i know that i can take it, as long as i can face it"
"your love like shelter from the rain, and that touch i can't explain"
"i know that i can take it, as long as i can face it, with you"
"as long as i can face it, with you (you, ooh-ooh, ooh)"
would i cry for you?
would i freeze over?
would i slip through the cracks unnoticed?
or crash into you? crash into you (woah)
"when i feel like a storm is on its way (on its way) , and my skies are turning grey"
"i know that i can take it (i know) , as long as i can face it (i can face it)"
"your love like shelter from the rain (from the rain) , and that touch i can't explain"
"i know that i can take it, as long as i can face it, with you"
"as long as i can face it, with you (you, ooh-ooh, ooh)"
(as long as i)
as long as i can face it with you
as long as i can face it with you
as long as i can face it with you
as long as i can face it with you
"i've been blinded, by my feelings"
self pity and sorrow was all i could see
tears i was crying
"kept me from seeing, i didn't love"
that man as much as he loved me
looking for excuses and other reasons
to keep myself in a constant doubt
after all my searching and undo hurting
i nearly lost the only good thing i ever found.
bring on the sunshine
take away the rain
bring on the sunshine
my baby's coming home again
take away the grey skies
hello love of mine
happy days are coming my way
bring on the sunshine.
no more sorrow is going to find me
i have made my last mistake
"and once i get him, right here beside me"
i'm gonna give him all the love he'd care to take.
bring on the sunshine
take away the rain
bring on the sunshine
my baby's coming home again
take away the grey skies
hello love of mine
happy days are coming my way
bring on the sunshine.
bring on the sunshine
take away the rain
bring on the sunshine
my baby's coming home again
take away the grey skies
hello love of mine
happy days are coming my way
bring on the sunshine.
bring on the sunshine
take away the rain
bring on the sunshine
my baby's coming home again
take away the grey skies
hello love of mine
happy days are coming my way
bring on the sunshine
i walk around like a nervous wreck
"i'm a fool, but what the heck"
i'm standing here up to my neck in desire
"i wanna call, want you to know"
what i'm feeling in my soul
"girl, i tried, but i can't control this fire"
it's killing me
you're all i see
one life is not enough
"you're all i need, the air i breathe"
i can't live without your love
i've been searching all my life
just to feel this way inside
now that i do i just can't hide no more
"the touch, the feel of your skin"
makes me feel alive again
and it shakes me to the core
it's killing me
you're all i see
one life is not enough
"you're all i need, the air i breathe"
i can't live without your love
i just wanna hold you
for the rest of my life
"you're all i need, the air i breathe"
i can't live without your love
can't live without your love
i walk around like a nervous wreck
"i'm a fool, but what the heck"
i can't live without your love
"i want to call, want you to know"
what i'm feeling in my soul
i can't live without your love
"way down in columbus, georgia"
want to be back in tennessee
way down in columbus stockade
friends all turned their backs on me
go and leave me if you wish to
never let it cross your mind
if in your heart you love another
"leave me little darling, i don't mind"
last night as i lay sleeping
i dreamt i held you in my arms
when i awoke i was mistaken
i was peering through the bars
many a night with you i've rambled
many an hour with you i've spent
thought i had your heart forever
now i find it's only lent
his pulpit's a corner
on 19th and main
his grip on the gospel
his one claim to fame
he hurls fire and brrimstone
at the cars passing by
and he offers salvation
for the savior on high
his khakis are tattered
and he aint bathed in weeks
his bout with the bottle
shows up on his cheeks
he looks like a scarecrow
a sight to behold
as he works for the shepherd
bringin lambs to the fold
he points to the bible
he holds in his hands
says im proof that the good lord
can save any man
"son, it aint what youre driving"
or the clothes that you wear
material possessions
wont matter up there
and someday in heaven
when the angels all sing
these rags that im wearin
will be fit for a king
hes fighting a fever
in spite of the chill
he pulls up his collar
and he speaks of gods will
his body is weakend
but his faith is sitll strong
for hes filled with conviction
for the mission he's on
he knows soon in heaven
hell be homeless no more
as his work will soon echo
from that far distant shore
(chours)
and someday in heaven
when the angels all sing
these rags that i'm wearin'
will be fit for a king
and someday in heaven
when the angels all sing
these rags that i'm wearin'
i went to church last sunday
so i could sing and pray
but something quite unusual
happened on that day
now church it started right on time
just like it does without a doubt
and everything was all just fine
except when it came time to let us out
you know the preacher he kept preaching
he told us i have one more thing to say
children before you think of leaving
you better think about the judgment day
now everyone got nervous
because everyone was hungry too
and everyone was wondering
what was the next thing he would do
and the preacher he kept preaching
he said now i'll remind you if i may
you all better pay attention
or i might decide to preach all day
and now everyone was getting so hungry
that the old ones started feeling ill
and the weak ones started passing out
and the young ones they could not sit still
and the preacher's voice rose higher
so i snuck up on the balcony
and i crept into the choir
"and i begged them brothers, sisters, help me please"
i said when i give you a signal
i said when i raise up my hand
won't you please join with me together
and praise the lord i have a plan
and the preacher he kept preaching
"long is the struggle, hard the fight"
"and i prayed, father please forgive me"
and then i stood up and with all my might
i sang
to the lord let praises be
it's time for dinner now let's go eat
we've got some beans and some good cornbread
and i listened to what the preacher said
now it's to the lord let praised be
it's time for dinner now let's go eat
yes and i did give a signal
yes and i raised up my hands
and then joined with me the choir
"yes every woman, child, and man"
they sang
to the lord let praised be
it's time for dinner now let's go eat
we've got some beans and some good cornbread
and i've listened to what the preacher said
now it's to the lord let praised be
it's time for dinner now let's go eat
and the preacher he stopped preaching
and a hush the church did fill
and then a great white dove from up above
landed on the window sill
and the dove flew down beside him
and a fork appeared right in his hand
and with everybody watching
the preacher ate that bird right there and then
and now everyone got really nervous
and the preacher he did start to glow
and as we watched in disbelief
these were the words he spoke
he said now mama's in the kitchen
and she's been there all day
and i know she's cooking something good
so let's bow our heads and pray
and he sang
to the lord let praises be
it's time for dinner now let's go eat
we've got some beans and some good cornbread
now listen to what the preacher said
he said to the lord let praised be
it's time for dinner now let's go eat
and the moral of this story
children it is plain but true
god knows if a preacher preaches long enough
even he'll get hungry too
and he'll sing
to the lord let praises be
it's time for dinner now let's go eat
we've got some beans and some good cornbread
now listen to what the preacher said
he said to the lord let praised be
it's time for dinner now let's go eat
they like to kick you when you're down
they like it better when you're there on the ground
and up 'til now i've never made a sound
"(hey, hey!)"
i bet they never had a broken heart
but they sure know how to beat the hell out of one
sometimes i think they do it just for fun
"(hey, hey!)"
"but no, i'm not leaving, even though i'm bleeding"
even though this nightmare makes me wish i was dreaming
"even though i hate it, i'm gonna take it"
until i win
"'cause i'm a comeback, i'm a comeback kid"
"don't know why bad things happened, but they did"
"i don't think i deserve the hurt i get, but i'm made for it"
"it's not the end, no, it's not the end"
i'm a comeback kid
down for a minute; i'll get up again
"looks like i'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet"
cause in the end
"i'm a comeback, i'm a comeback kid"
i'm gonna finish what i started now
you interrupted me with all your doubts
how dare you forget where i started out
"(uh-oh, uh-oh)"
"but no, i'm not leaving, even though i'm bleeding"
even though this nightmare makes me wish i was dreaming
"even though i hate it, i'm gonna take it"
until i win
"'cause i'm a comeback, i'm a comeback kid"
"don't know why bad things happened, but they did"
"i don't think i deserve the hurt i get, but i'm made for it"
"it's not the end, no, it's not the end"
i'm a comeback kid
down for a minute; i'll get up again
"looks like i'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet"
cause in the end
"i'm a comeback, i'm a comeback kid, uh-huh"
i believe in what i am; i believe in what i was
"i believe in losing you, i've never been given so much"
"i believe it's been a year, the worst one i've ever lived"
i believe i'm better now than i have ever been
i believe that ever since everything went south
i believed in every word that ever came out of my mouth
"i believe you missed me, but you don't have to miss me, cause"
i'm not leaving again
"'cause i'm a comeback, i'm a comeback kid"
down for a minute; i'll get up again
"looks like i'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet"
'cause in the end
"yeah, i'm a comeback, i'm a comeback kid"
"i'm not leaving, i'm not leaving"
"not leaving again, i'm not leaving"
"not leaving again, i'm not leaving"
i'll save you a spot at my big parade
you're all invited on my comeback day
i'll serve you ice cream and lemonade
"(hey, hey!)"
(rodney crowell)
down in louisiana bayous by and by
a peir or a pole or your natural soul
keeps you tied to a tree high tide
beer joint lights come on
and then crowd starts rollin' in
pretty soon you got stars on the water
you got stars on the water
you got stars on the water
when it rains
beaumont to biloxi sea breeze at your door
gypsy rains dang hurricanes
white silver sandy shores
blue light lounge is shinin'
way out on the pier
makes it look just like stars on the water
just like stars on the water
just like stars on the water
when it rains
when it's midnight down in mobile
shining moon beams on the bay
they come from miles around
to dance the jukebox down
to hear the good time sounds they play
and all across the harbor night life shinin' on
makes you feel just like stars on the water
just like stars on the water
just like stars on the water
"one in a million in a lonely town,"
"two hundred people trying to keep me down,"
"i've taken all i can, i ain't lookin' back."
"small town boy in a back yard lot,"
can't make a living with the luck i've got
"i'm gonna leave it all, i ain't looking back."
"that's the way i remember, it seemed to me when i was young."
"but i can still see the leaves slowly fall to the ground,"
and the snow on the trees as the winter comes down.
still i go home again in my heart.
my father worked hard on the railroad track;
"37 years cut across his back,"
he gave it all he had for what he believed.
"like every other kid that came before,"
i grew up believing there was something more
"and i still believe, i still believe."
"that's the way i remember, it seemed to me when i was young."
"but i can still see the leaves slowly fall to the ground,"
and the snow on the trees as the winter comes down.
still i go home again in my heart.
but i can still see the lightning on a warm summer night
and the rain on the roof when i close my eyes;
i can still hear us laughing on the front porch in the dark.
there are days when i know that i've traveled so far
"that i'll never find the road leading back to the start,"
still i go home again in my heart
still i go home again in my heart
"in my heart, in my heart"
it's like a storm
that cuts a path
it's breaks your will
it feels like that
you think you're lost
but you're not lost on your own
you're not alone
i will stand by you
i will help you through
when you've done all you can do
and you can't cope
i will dry your eyes
i will fight your fight
i will hold you tight
and i won't let go
it hurts my heart
to see you cry
i know it's dark
this part of life
"oh, it finds us all"
and we're too small
to stop the rain
"oh, but when it rains"
i will stand by you
i will help you through
when you've done all you can do
and you can't cope
i will dry your eyes
i will fight your fight
i will hold you tight
and i won't let you fall
don't be afraid to fall
i'm right here to catch you
i won't let you down
it won't get you down
you're gonna make it
"yeah, i know you can make it"
'cause i will stand by you
i will help you through
when you've done all you can do
and you can't cope
and i will dry your eyes
i will fight your fight
i will hold you tight
and i won't let go
oh i'm gonna hold you
and i won't let go
won't let you go
no i won't
i couldn't believe it the day that you left
"cleaned out your closet, cleared off your shelves"
loaded your car and you drove out of sight
but i never said goodbye
i'll never say goodbye
"the door's always open, i leave on a light"
i'm always waiting in case you drop by
i'll never say goodbye
people have told me you have a new love
my heart's not willing to give up on us
i've convinced myself they're just telling me lies
and i'll never say goodbye
i'll never say goodbye
"the door's always open, i leave on a light"
i never wanted you out of my life
and i'll never say goodbye
i'll never say goodbye
"the door's always open, i leave on a light"
i'll be loving you till the day that i die
and i'll never say goodbye
"if you'll just come back, i won't even ask why"
"i'll never say goodbye, no i'll never say goodbye"
i'm in a hurry to get things done
"(oh,) i rush & rush until life's no fun"
all i really gotta do is live & die
"but, i'm in a hurry & don't know why"
don't know why
i have to drive so fast
my car has nothing to prove
"it's not new, but it'll 0-60 in 5.2, oh"
can't be late
i leave in plenty of time
shakin' hands with the clock
i can't stop
"i'm on a roll & i'm ready to rock oh,"
i hear a voice
it says i'm running behind
i better pick up my pace
it's a race & there ain't no room for someone in 2nd place
to taos pueblo out in new mexico
one night my weary feet did go so i stopped that night in taos
there's a story in taos town that if a stranger comes around
when a fresh snow is on the ground a new love will be born in taos
that night there came a snow in the mountains and the valleys below
and i found a love that's true i know in taos new mexico
[ ac.guitar ]
that night in taos town it seemed love was all around
and the pretty little girl i found a new love was born in taos
from the first time we met i knew her love would always be true
and i know i'll always love her too the love that i found in taos
some night if it should snow there's a place you really ought to go
there's a legend that it's true i know in taos new mexico
"you told me you don't love me, when you walked out the door"
"i stood there feelin' lonely, then the tears began to pour"
"what else could i do, i'd never felt like that before"
so i cried an ol' blue river in the middle of the floor
now i'm up to my ears in tears
i'm cryin' night and day since you went away
"the things you used to say honey, i no longer hear"
"the water's cold and clear, i'm drownin' for you dear"
up to my ears in tears
well i found some old love letters you wrote me years ago
but the words all ran together when the tears began to flow
'cause you left that water runnin' now it's got nowhere to go
if i can't wash away your memory guess i'll just go under slow
'cause i'm up to my ears in tears
i'm cryin' night and day since you went away
"the things you used to say honey, i no longer hear"
"the water's cold and clear, i'm drownin' for you dear"
up to my ears in tears
yeah i'm up to my ears in tears
i'm cryin' night and day since you went away
"the things you used to say honey, i no longer hear"
"that water's cold and clear, i'm drownin' for you dear"
up to my ears in tears
yeah that water's cold and clear
i'm drownin' for you dear
up to my ears in tears
every time that someone walks in
she turns around to see if it's him
she checks her watch by the clock
i can't count the times he's stood her up
and one's too much
how could anybody break a heart like hers
i can't stand to watch her hurt
i would gladly take his place
if she'd just love me that way
he must not know what it's worth
i don't understand how anyone
could break a heart like hers
she keeps saying he'll change someday
he wasn't always this way
she things he hung the moon and stars
but all he's done is string her along like this
it don't make sense
how could anybody break
a heart like hers
my daddy's hands held three's and two's while mom's were holding me
and daddy's hands lost everything to a hand of kings and three's
and daddy's hands they shook so bad that he turned to wine
but mama's hands were strong and calm as they held on to mine
yes mama's hands held on to mine to guide me day and night
and it took the schem of mama's hands to teach me wrong from right
when times were bad and money's slim she'd fold her hands in fray
ands somehow she would make the food hold out another day
now mama's hands they tremble when she prays
but her voice is strong as she thanks god for the bygone days
she looks at me and then she smiles she knows i understand
that everything i am today i owe to mama's hands
everything i am today i owe to mama's hands
written by d. frazier and a. owens
the honey bees are gonna be hummin'

no more tears are gonna be fallin'
i done heard my true love callin'
open arms are waitin' yonder 'round the bend

big sweet flowers are gonna be growin'
when i'm back in my baby's arms again
the voice of love is gonna be talkin'

"oh, honey"
santa looked a lot like daddy
or daddy looked a lot like him
it's not the way i had him pictured
santa was much too thin
well he didn't come down the chimney
so mama must have let him in
santa looked a lot like daddy
or daddy looked a lot like him
well they thought that i was fast a sleepin'
they thought that i was tucked in bed
they never thought that i'd come a peepin'
or that i'd hear what was said
santa put his arm around mama
and mama put her arm around him
so if santa claus ain't daddy
them i'm gonna tell on them
santa looked a lot like daddy
or daddy looked a lot like him
it's not the way i had him pictured
santa was much too thin
well he didn't come down the chimney
so mama must have let him in
santa looked a lot like daddy
or daddy looked a lot like him
i never saw dancer or prancer
i never heard the sleigh bells ring
and i never saw the red nosed reindeer
like they show him on the tv screen
but he sure brought a lot of presents
so santa claus he must have been
santa looked a lot like daddy
or daddy looked a lot like him
santa looked a lot like daddy
or daddy looked a lot like him
it's not the way i had him pictured
santa was much too thin
well he didn't come down the chimney
so mama must have let him in
santa looked a lot like daddy
or daddy looked a lot like him
i seen the bright lights of memphis
and the commodore hotel
and it was there beneath a streetlamp
where i met a southern belle
well she took me to the river
where she cast her spell
and it was neath that memphis moonlight
she sang this song so well
if youll be my dixie chicken
ill be your tennesee lamb
and we can walk together
down in dixie land
down in dixie land
we hit all the hotspots
my money flowed like wine
till the lowdown southern whiskey
began to fog my mind
well i dont remember church bells
or the money i put down
on the white picket fence and boardwalk
at the house on the edge of town
now but boy do i remember
the strain of her refrain
and the nights we spent together
and the way she called my name
its been a year since she ran away
guess that guitar player sure could play
she always liked to sing along
he was always handy with a song
then one night in the lobby
of the commodore hotel
i by chance met a bartender
who said he knew her well
and as he handed me a drink
he bagan to hum a song
and all the boys there at the bar
began to sing along
merry christmas
merry christmas to everyone
merry christmas
christmas on the square
everybody's there
"laughing, singing"
bells are ringing
snow is in the air
carolers singing

i remember how your eyes used to light up
over promises that i made
but for the first time in my life
i know now how it feels to be afraid
i don't know what i’d do if you go away
this would sure be one lonely old town
for a man's so busy going up in the world
that he couldn't see love coming down
love coming down
i remember all the times you told me
love's all that matters to you
"and looking back now, wondering how i believed"
i had things more important to do
i can see how i must have looked to you
like some fool on a merry-go-round
and that a man's so busy going up in the world
that he couldn't see love going down
love going down
can't you see how everything i’ve learned
would just be wasted if you leave me
if you just give one more try
i swear i’ll always be here when you need me
if you can find it in your heart to forgive me
i'll try to keep both my feet on the ground
but if a man's so busy going up in the world
that he couldn't see love coming down
love coming down
this is a call to the colorblind
this is an iou
stranded behind a horizon line
try to be something true
"guess, i'm grounded"
got my wings clipped
i'm surrounded by
all this pavement
guess i'll circle
while i'm waiting
for my fuse to dry
someday i'll fly
someday i'll soar
someday i'll be
so damn much more
cause i'm bigger than my body
gives me credit for
why is it not the time?
what is there more to learn?
i've shed this skin i've been tripping in
and i've never quite returned
"guess, i'm grounded"
got my wings clipped
i'm surrounded by
all this pavement
guess i'll circle
while i'm waiting
for my fuse to dry
cause i'm bigger than my body now
maybe i'll tangle in the power lines
and it might be over in a second's time
but i'll gladly go down in a flame
if the flame's what it takes to remember my name
"to remember my name, oh"
"yes, i'm grounded"
got my wings clipped
i'm surrounded by
all this pavement
guess i'll circle
while i'm waiting
for my fuse to dry
cause i'm bigger than my body
bigger than my body
bigger than my body now
come and listen you fellows
so young and do fine
and seek not your fortune
"in the dark, dreary mines"
it will form as a habit
seep in your soul
'til the blood in your veins
runs as black as the coal
there's many a man
that i've known in my day
who lived just to labor
his whole life away
like a fiend with his dope
and a drunkard his wine
a man will have lust for
the lure of the mine
it's dark as a dungeon
damp as the dew
the danger is double
and the pleasures are few
where the rain never falls
where the sun never shines
it's dark as a dungeon
way down in the mine
i hope when i'm gone
and the ages shall roll
my body will blacken
and turn into coal
then i'll look out the door
of my heavenly home
and i'll pity the miners
a-diggin' my bones
it's dark as a dungeon
damp as the dew
the danger is double
and the pleasures are few
where the rain never falls
where the sun never shines
it's dark as a dungeon
way down in the mine
where the rain never falls
where the sun never shines
it's dark as a dungeon
way down in the mine
girl i've been at work all work

the last one to know so i'm gonna put
mountains and deserts and rivers between us
go as far as i can go
might make it to memphis
but that ain't far enough
"i speed down the highway to tulsa, mizzoula"
so fast that the hurt can't catch up
i'm burning your memory
one mile at a time
all the way to tacoma
by then i hope you're out of my mind
might be some tears in topeka
a couple of sleepless nights in cheyenne
and the time i miss you
i'll hit the gas as fast as i can
might make it to memphis
the kansas city line
all the way to tacoma
by then i hope you're out of my mind
all the way to tacoma
by then i hope you're out of my mind

"well you can't eat, can't sleep down on the floor"
cause you never fell man's heart before
now there's nothing in this world you want more
then to be free
"and you're lost somewhere, you swore you'd never go"
and the way back looks like a dead end road
"but with one step, one breath, one smile at a time"
let me get you out of here
wipe away all your tears
now you're safe in these arms of mine
i won't ever let you down
your heart will start to come around
we gonna change your life
one sunrise at a time
"well, you can't get rid of all his lies"
thinkin' 'bout him all the time
can i be the reason you've got nothin' on your mind
"oh, let me get you out of here"
wipe away all your tears
now you're safe in these arms of mine
i won't ever let you down
your heart will start to come around
we gonna change your life
one sunrise at a time
let me hold you tight
all through the night
till you awake
till all this pain
is gone with yesterday
gone with yesterday
"oh, let me get you out of here"
"oh, i won't ever let you down"
your heart will start to come around
we gonna change your life
one sunrise at a time
"oh, one sunrise"

sittin up on the roof
sneakin a smoke by the chimney
checkin out the moon
and the city lights
takes off his flannel shirt
and he drapes it around his shoulders
he slides up behind her and holds her tight
and she says
i don't want this night to end
why does it have to end?
tomorrow she'll be rollin' down 19 baton rouge l.s.u.
18 years in her rear view
"he's got a friday paycheck lined up down the block,"
and daddy's shop it isn't much but it's a job
they've been dreadin' this moment all summer long
the night before life goes on
a tear falls off her cheek
right when it hits his arm he says
come on baby let's get out of here
they take one last ride around time
and man it already looks different
he bangs the wheel and says
life's not fair
"this growin' up stuff,"
man i don't know
i just don't wanna let you go
yeah (her infamous rock growl in the word yeah..
mwahah)
that's what my mama told me
and just like those kids
i didnt' wanna listen to no one
yeah there's nothin you can do
there's nothin you can say
and i know how it feels
when love goes away
he went bad with his child and wife lord he leads a miserable life
but still he thinks the bottle is his right hand
yes and he can tear down more than he's ever built before
a man can be a drunk sometimes but a drunk can't be a man
he lets his business led behind or the nightlife he can find
why he does all this he'll never understand
and in the morning when he wakes up lord he can't wait to fill his cup
a man can be a drunk sometimes but a drunk can't be a man
for he goes from doctor jackill to mr hide
he seem proud to have the devil for his guide
still he keeps on reaching out lord he needs a helping hand
but a man can be a drunk sometimes but a drunk can't be a man
yes a man can be a drunk sometimes but a drunk can't be a man
"'tis so sweet to trust in jesus,"
and to take him at his word;
"just to rest upon his promise,"
"and to know, ""thus saith the lord."""
refrain:
"jesus, jesus, how i trust him!"
how i've proved him o'er and o'er!
"jesus, jesus, precious jesus!"
o for grace to trust him more!
"i'm so glad i learned to trust thee,"
"precious jesus, savior, friend;"
"and i know that thou art with me,"
wilt be with me to the end.
(refrain)
(paul brandt/steve rosen)
the shadows move slowly
they climb up the walls
till the light hits the metal and glass
it shines through the dust
revealing the love
in an old black and white photograph
that was before
but it's not anymore
'cause outside the frame
you're getting on with your life
i wonder if i ever will
'cause inside my heart
i picture us frozen in time
just you and i standing still
now everything's changed
outside the frame
the look in your eyes
your hand in mine
and we're both holding on to a dream
i'm still trapped in that moment
where the sun always shines
and i don't ever want to be free
"no, i want to stay"
as the light fades away
'cause outside the frame
you're getting on with your life
i wonder if i ever will
'cause inside my heart
i picture us frozen in time
just you and i standing still
now everything's changed
outside the frame
outside the frame
where you're getting on with your life
and i know that i never will
'cause inside my heart
i picture us frozen in time
just you and i standing still
now everything's changed
outside the frame
i keep waiting for something to change
but the picture inside stays the same
i don't want to hear it no more fussin' and a fightin' baby hold me tight
let's let bygones be bygones let's think about tomorrow boy our future's bright
i know i was wrong but i was just a fool too blind to see
you were the only boy for me
ah but now i see the light and everything's gonna be alright baby hold me tight
pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa...
i know i was wrong...
you know i love you ooh you know i need you
i don't mean maybe you will always be my baby
pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa...
ever ever after
"storybook endings, fairy tales coming true"
deep down inside we wanna believe they still do
"and a secret is heart, it's our favorite part of the story"
let's just admit we all want to make it too
ever ever after
if we just don't get it our own way
ever ever after
it may only be a wish away
"start a new fashion, wear your heart on your sleeve"
sometimes you reach what's realest just by making believe
"unafraid, unashamed"
there is joy to be claimed in this world
you even might wind up being glad to be you
ever ever after
though the world will tell you it's not smart
ever ever after
the world can be yours if you let your heart
believe in ever after
no wonder your heart feels it's flying
your head feels it's spinning
each happy ending's a brand new beginning
"let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through"
to ever ever after
forever could even start today
ever ever after
maybe it's just one wish away
your ever ever after
ever ever ever aftter
(i've been dreaming of a true love's kiss)
"oh, for ever ever after"
a little white house with black wooden shadows
a porch with its columns all covered with vine
my broken dream house where he lives with another
but this was supposed to be mine
two little children that look like their daddy
with the same smile and the same eyes that shine
the only thing wrong iæš¦ not their mommy
but they were supposed to be mine
heæš¯ given to her what he promised to me
the plans that we made never can be
for each night he holds and carresses another
and she is supposed to be me
heæš¯ given to her what he promised to me
the plans that we made never can be
for each night he holds and carresses another
and she is supposed to be me
and he is supposed to be mine
minni-ha-cha was the name of the maid
that was old kawliga's gal
the customer took far far away
but kawliga's with her now
minni-ha-cha
she left a trail for ol' wooden head to find
now ol' kawliga's with her all the time
she dropped her beads along the way
to make a trail for him
she knew if ol kawliga stayed her life would be so grim
minni-ha-cha
how she loved that poor ol' wooden head
the man of knotty pine with a face so red
minni-ha-cha
years have passed and now at last they got papoose by the score
kawliga beats his old tom tom while she sweeps the floor
minni-ha-cha
she works her fingers to the bone
while ol' kawliga sings an indian song
minni-ha-cha
now you've heard the story about a wooden head affair
an indian with a tomahawk and a maiden with the coal black hair
minni-ha-cha
they're as happy as anyone can be
‘cause they're together and have a family
minni-ha-cha
(gary harrison/tim mensy)
i know she must've cut you deep
she's gone but you won't let her leave
i know your heart has not healed yet
but sometimes i think that you forget
that wasn't me
that wasn't me
i'm not the one
who made love bring you to your knees
you can't love if you can't trust
her memory's hurt you long enough
let your heart see
that wasn't me
i can no longer pay the price
for damage done by her careless lies
we can't move on 'til you let go
i always thought by now you'd know
that wasn't me
that wasn't me
i'm not the one
who made love bring you to your knees
you can't love if you can't trust
her memory's hurt you long enough
let your heart see
that wasn't me
you can't love if you can't trust
her memory's hurt you long enough
let your heart see
when the last breath of life is gone from my body and my lips are as cold as the sea
when my friends gather round to my farewell party
please won't you pretend you love me
there'll be flowers from those who'll cry when i'll go
and leave you in this old world alone
will you shed a tear at my farewell party or will you be glad when i'm gone
don't be angry with me a wanting to keep you
till my life in this old world is done and through
you'll be free at the end of my farewell party but i'll go away loving you
there'll be flowers from those...
you say you and her are really over
don't wanna make up just to fall apart again
you say you want off this roller coaster
"well, friend, let me ask you this"
can you stand to see her dancin' in somebody else's arms?
do you think that you'll go crazy every time you see her car?
"if you can't scroll by her number, not dial it on your phone"
well that's all you need to know
don't leave her
if you can't let her go
i ain't saying you ain't got good reason
for wanting to take a match to everything
but before you set your mind on leavin'
you really oughta stop and think
can you run across her picture and not wonder where she is?
can you catch the scent of her perfume
and not think about her kiss?
if you can't stop dreamin' 'bout her when you're sleepin' all alone
well that's all you need to know
don't leave her
swallow your pride and turn this thing around
cause this here is a road
you don't wanna go down
if you can't stand to see her dancin' in somebody else's arms
or you think that you'll go crazy every time you see her car
if you can't scroll by her number and not dial it on your phone
well that's all you need to know
don't leave her
don't leave her
if you can't let her go
if you can't let her go
if you don't take me to paris
on a lover's getaway
"it's all right, it's all right"
if i'd rather wear your t-shirt
than a sexy negligee
"it's all right, it's all right"
every dinner doesn't have to be candelit
it's kinda nice to know that is doesn't have to be
perfect
baby every little piece
of the puzzle doesn't always fit
perfectly
"love can be rough around the edges, tattered at the seams"
but honey if it's good enough for you
it's good enough for me
if your mother doesn't like
the way i treat her baby boy
"it's all right, it's all right"
if in every wedding picture
my daddy looks annoyed
"it's all right, it's all right"
don't you know that all the fairy tales tell a lie
real love and real life doesn't have to be
perfect
baby every little piece
of the puzzle doesn't always fit
perfectly
"love can be rough around the edges, tattered at the seams"
but honey if it's good enough for you
it's good enough for me
you don't mind if i show up late for everything
and when you lose your cool it's kinda cute to me
ain't it nice to know that we don't have to be
perfect
baby every little piece
of the puzzle doesn't always fit
perfectly
"love can be rough around the edges, tattered at the seams"
but honey if it's good enough for you
it's good enough for me
it's good enough for me (perfect)
yeah good enough for me (perfect)

"so draw the curtain, honey"

she's history
no one would give her a star on the walk
she'd have a hundred if pillows could talk
where have i seen her before?
she's the face on the cutting room floor
it's no mystery
acting in school at the tenderest age
lit up the room when she stepped on the stage
came to la for some more
she's the face on the cutting room floor
she had visions of contracts
and thousands of people in line
to see her;
"knocking on door after door after all of this time,"
now she's not sure
up in hollywood
stayed with an agent she met in a bar
laughed when he told her he'd make her a star
where has she heard that before?
she's the face on the cutting room floor
one night he told her that she'd never get anywhere
in her clothes
that's what it takes to play movieland musical chairs
now she knows
goodbye hollywood
leaving tonight on the 2:30 'hound
sunrise or sunset she won't be around
but they'll replace her with so many more
she's the face on the cutting room floor
poor little face on the cutting room floor
they’re comin across the border by the thousands everyday
lookin’ for a better life in the good ol’ u.s.a.
"well, everybody’s talkin’ about the aliens invadin’"
while i’m savin’ every dime for a mexican vacation
"me, i’m headed your way, hasta luego jose"
"you say “hola”, i’ll say “hi”"
when i pass you at the border slap me a high five
you better pack a poncho ‘cause it sure gets cold up here
"me, i’m headed south for hot women and cheap beer"
here’s the keys to my chevrolet
you can have the house and the bills i pay
welcome to the good ol’ u.s.a.
"i’m headed your way, jose"
"(cuervo that is, lil’ sunshine, some margaritas,"
"cabo san lucas, maybe go see chichinitza, i love that word)"
up here we work our asses off just tryin’ to get ahead
but you can’t spend a dollar if you’ve worked yourself to death
from what i hear you way of life is an afternoon siesta
then back to work for a little while for an all night long fiesta
"me, i’m headed your way"
well sounds to me like a pretty fair trade
"you say “hola”, i’ll say “hi”"
when i pass you at the border slap me a high five
you better pack a poncho ‘cause it sure gets cold up here
"me, i’m headed south for hot women and cheap beer"
here’s the keys to my chevrolet
you can have the house and the bills i pay
welcome to the good ol’ u.s.a.
"i’m headed your way, jose"
"(white sandy beaches, pesos and jalapenos,"
"palm trees, ocean breeze, ah man, dos equis)"
"you say “hola”, i’ll say “hi”"
when i pass you at the border slap me a high five
you better pack a poncho ‘cause you’ll freeze your ass off here
"me, i’m headed south for hot women and cheap beer"
here’s the keys to my chevrolet
you can have the house and the bills i pay
"me, i’m kickin’ back in the mexican shade"
"i’m headed your way, jose"
"(yeah, i’m hittin’ the road, man, give me a little burro to ride on, you"
"can have my car, that gas is killin’ me)"
i heard the front door closing softly as i weaken from my sleep
with the last touch of her lips lord like a whisper on my cheek
and i cursed the sun for rising for the worst lord is yet to come
cause this morning she's just leaving but come sundown she'll be gone
see the lipstick on the pillow that i placed beneath her head
and the soft sheets still feel warm lord where she lay upon my bed
and it hurts to know it's over for the hurt lord had just begun
cause this morning she's just leaving but come sundown she'll be gone
"i heard an old, old story, how a savior came from glory"
how he gave his life on calvary to save a wretch like me
"i heard about his groaning, of his precious blood's atoning"
"then i repented of my sins, and won the victory"
"oh, victory in jesus, my savior forever"
he sought me and bought me with his redeeming blood
he loved me 'ere i knew him and all my love is due him
he plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood
"i heard about his healing, of his cleansing power revealing"
how he made the lame to walk again and caused the blind to see
"and then i cried, ""dear jesus, come and heal my broken spirit"""
and somehow jesus came and brought to me the victory
"oh, victory in jesus, my savior forever"
he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood
he loved me 'ere i knew him and all my love is due him
"he plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood, oh"
oh yeah
"sweet, sweet jesus"
mm
ooh
mm
"yes, victory in jesus, my savior forever"
he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood
he loved me 'ere i knew him and all my love is due him
"he plunged me to victory, beneath the cleansing flood"
"yes, he plunged me to victory, beneath the cleansing flood"

"hey baby let's go to vegas,"
kiss the single life goodbye.
"hey baby let's go to vegas,"
"bet on love, and let it ride."
"find a little wedding chapel,"
"a pair of rings, and a preacher, too."
underneath the neon steeple
"will take a gamble and say ""i do."""
"hey baby let's go to vegas,"
kiss the single life goodbye.
"hey baby let's go to vegas,"
bet on love and let it ride.
viva las vegas!
"sparkle lighs,"
"dangerous living, tumbling dice."
"you're my ace in the hole now, honey,"
and i'm your lady luck.
"pack a few things and a little money,"
and put it in the truck.

"i love my life, love my husband"
"without those kid's, man i ain't nothin'"
"i love my fans, love my band"
love my little tennessee piece of land
sometimes my life can get so hectic
out of the blue when i least expect it
somewhere between the hubbub and the drama
i get to thinkin' bout mama and
i'm caught up in missing missouri
'cause i wanna be with my family
instead of stuck out on this road i'm on
everytime my bus wheels hit the bootheel
there's no limelight and i'm alright
'cause i'm almost home
"where they love me, where they know me"
where they show me back in missouri
the road just ain't no place for whiners
"it's motels, truck stops, all night diners"
hoping that your song'll sell
and having to smile when it ain't doin well
so when everything just gets too much
and i feel like i'm givin up
i close my eyes and say a little prayer
and its like i'm there and
late summer nights sneakin out the window
me and the girls driving down the backroads
tobacco fields and bumblebees
and the cardinals playing on tv
"out on highway 1, i saw a camper van parked out on the shoulder"
"thinkin' they had broken down, i pulled over"
there was a little old lady and her old man kickin' back relaxin'
"they said ""sit down and help us celebrate our golden anniversary"""
"they had foldin' chairs, they were holdin' hands starin' at the fields"
"i said ""man this ain't no movie, this is real"""
love should be as simple as that
"foldin' chairs, holdin' hands and matching baseball caps"
love is wanting what you have
love should be as simple as that
"they said ""stay awhile"", i siad ""i thought i might and ask some burnin' questions"""
"like how'd you make love last so long, they started laughing"
"he said ""to keep our love from danger, i treat her like a stranger"""
"courteous, considerate and kind"
love should be as simple as that
"foldin' chairs, holdin' hands and matching baseball caps"
love is wanting what you have
love should be as simple as that
"so i went home and i said ""baby, baby listen"""
there's something missin' in our lives
"she said "" i know, i been tryin' to tell you"""
"we need more communication, an exotic vacation"
"big screen tv, redwood jacuzzi"
"dinners out, concerts and movies"
"new kitchen, big addition, a pool, jewelry"
"sauna, fish pond and a five acre lawn"
"i said "" get in the camper"""
love should be as simple as that
"foldin' chairs, holdin' hands and matching baseball caps"
love is wanting what you have
love should be as simple as that
love should be as simple as that
love should be as simple as that
"i been up, i been down."
"take my word, my way around"
i ain't askin' for much
"i said, lord, take me downtown,"
i'm just lookin' for some tush
"i been bad, i been good,"
"dallas, texas; hollywood"
i ain't askin' for much
"i said, lord, take me downtown,"
i'm just lookin' for some tush
"take me back way back home,"
"not by myself, not alone"
i ain't askin' for much
"i said, lord, take me downtown,"
i'm just lookin' for some tush
"take me, take me to your darkest room"
close every window and bolt every door
the very first moment i heard your voice
i'd be in darkness no more
take me to your most barren desert
a thousand miles from the nearest sea
the very moment i saw your smile
it would be like heaven to me
there's not any mountain to rugged to climb
no desert too barren to cross
"darlin', if you would just show a sign"
"of love, i could bear with all loss"
take me to siberia
and the coldest weather of the winter time
and it would be just like spring in california
as long as i knew you were mine
"yes, it would be just like spring in california"
as long as i knew you were mine
well i married a gal from ole alabam
and i figured they'd feed me on chicken and ham
but to my surprise i got fooled
and they put me to plow with an ole blind mule
cleanin' new ground choppin briars and sleepin' by myself
i's invited out to supper the other night
and some of the boys they started a fight
they called the police you can plainly see
they all got away but poor ole me
i went to town with the sheriff he introduced me to the judge
and i stayed thirty days with the jailor actin' a big shot nice man
[ fiddle ]
now me and my wife's a goin' down the street
when my ole used to be i chanced to meet
she gave me the wink and my wife looked back
and boy you ought to seen me ball the jack
i run red lights turned corners and got caught just my luck
i was down in the barnyard the other night
it was awful dark and i had no light
i scrambled around and got hold of a goose
and the folks all thought i should turn him loose
i jumped rose bushes dodged bullets and fell in the creek
[ guitar ]
i was down in the barnyard on my knees
and i thought i heard a chicken sneeze
it was just an ole rooster sayin' his prayers
and givin' out a hymn to the hens upstairs
such preachin' the hens were all singin' too
rooster's prayin' takin' up a collection and payin' off in eggs
[ guitar ]
that ole trouble sure follows me
if i never see your loving face again
i’ll go on loving you ’till the end
and if my broken-hearted love dont find a way to mend
i’ll go on loving you ’till the end
the years and miles may separate you from me
the pain may lessen more as time goes by
but as for me your memories will never fade
and i’ll go on loving you ’till the end
if we’re ever free to love again i know
straight back to your waiting arms is where i’ll go
and i’ll stay forever and i’ll prove to you again
i’ll go on loving you ’till the end
and i’ll go on loving you ’till the end

i used to live in a darkened room
had aface of stone
and a heart of gloom
"lost my hope, i was so far gone"
cryin' all my tears
with the curtains drawn
i didn't know until my soul broke free
i've got these angels watching over me
oh watch me go
i'm a happy girl
everybody knows
that the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
in the whole wide world
is a happy girl
i used to hide in a party crowd
bottled up inside
feeling so left out
standing in a corner wearing concrete shoes
with my frozen smile
and my lighted fuse
now every time i start to feel like that
i roll my heart out like a welcome mat
laugh when i feel like it
cry when i feel like it
that's just how my life is
that's how it goes
oh watch me go
i'm a happy girl
and i've come to know
that the world won't change
just 'cause i complain
let the axis twirl
i'm a happy girl
"oh, yeah oh, yeah"
i'm a happy girl
(w. nelson):
i scandalized my brother while admitting that he sang some pretty songs
i heard that he'd been scandilizing me and lord i knew that that was wrong
now i'm looking at over something cool and feeling fool enough to see
"what i had called my brother,now he had every right to call on me"
"don't ever cuss that fiddle,boy unless you want that fiddle out of tune"
"that picker there in trouble,boy ain't nothing but another side of you"
"if we ever get to heaven,boy it ain't because we ain't done nothing wrong"
we're in this thing together so let settle down and steal each other's songs
(w. jennings):
i found a wounded brother drinking bitterly away the afternoon
and soon enough he turned on me like he'd done every face in that saloon
well we cussed him to the ground and said he couldn't even steal a decent song
but as soon as it was spoken we were sad enough to wish that we were wrong
i know that it sounds silly but i think that i just somebody's song
"(w. jennings,w. nelson):"
she's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
she loves him in spite of my ways that she don't understand
through teardrops and laughter we'll pass through this world hand in hand
a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
i still love you
"the door still creaks, the roof still leaks"
when the rain comes fallindown
the dog still barks at every car that comes around
"my boss at work, heæš¯ still a jerk"
that ainæš° nothing new
"iæš¦ such a dope, my heartæš¯ still broke"
æ…ause i still love you
my favorite picture of you is still on my windowsill
you wrote to me donæš° ever change
and iæš¦ afraid i never will
when day is done the night still comes
and i still toss and turn
"i still try to have some pride,"
"my arms still ache, my heart still waits"
and i know thereæš¯ no use
iæš¦ still a fool and itæš¯ so cruel
æ…ause i still love you

my window faces the south i'm almost halfway to heaven
snow is falling but still i can see fields of cotton calling to me

my window faces the south...

hangin’ out at the old park pool
right after sunday school
"banana boat, a rubber float"
another summer afternoon
bon fire at the creek tonight
bubba bringin’ some homemade wine
just enough to catch a buzz
and get us countrified
"oh, my my, that’s just the way we do it"
cut off levi’s and kickin’ country music
"miles from nowhere, there ain’t no city limits"
and that’s where you’re gonna find us havin’ a small town big time
a population 903
half of them are kin to me
and those that ain’t they know my name
we’re like one big family
gather at that old camp site
to lie about the fish and their size
uncle carl and his old guitar
singin’ louisiana saturday night!
"oh, my my, that’s just the way we do it"
cut off levi’s and kickin’ country music

"had to steal daddy's car, park it far from her house"
and throwing rocks at her window till she's sneaking out
how to get a college kid to get you good stuff?
mix a perfect drink in a sonic cup?
"how to lean back, fake a yawn"
stretch your arm 'round her shoulder
pull her closer til she let you lean in for a kiss?
how to turn a twenty into saturday night?
how to make her momma let you have her till midnight?
how not to let her know she's got you caught?
these are the things that you learn
"when your heart just wants to burn, burn"
these are the steps that you take
when you're only thinking one thing
and you don't know nothing 'bout a promise and forever
all you know is nothing's better than being together
"and the only thing you want in the world, is a girl"
how to act like you're listening to her about her day
when she's talking and she's blocking the game?
how to shut your mouth when it's that time of the month
knowing when she's mad and when she's really just drunk?
and you swear that you'll change all your ways
just to get her to believe you and move into your man cave
how to hide a ring in your pocket for weeks?
how to say them four words and make 'em sound so sweet
"that she'd never ever say no? no, no, no"
these are the things that you learn
"when your heart just wants to burn, burn"
these are the steps that you take
when you're only thinking one thing
and you don't know nothing 'bout living ever after
but you know you're nothing unless you get to have her
"and the only thing you want in the world, is a girl"
"oh, you won't believe the way she's got you acting"
she'll talk you into things you never thought would happen
"when the only thing you want in the world, is a girl"
"mm, yeah, just a girl"
"mmhmm, just a girl, just a girl"

sitting here with you
you ask me why my tongus is tied
i've tryed to make some since of all these things i feel inside
i've been searching for the perfect words to say
they've been said a thousand times
but they mean more today
'cause i'm head over heels for you
and all of the things you do
the heavens and earth have moved
i'm falling head over heels for you
so baby there it is i've let it go and now you know
it's funny how a feeling starts so small and starts to grow
i had every line rehearsed i'd say to you today
then you looked into my eyes and they just slipped away
'cause i'm head over heels for you
and all of the things you do
the heavens and earth have moved
"i'm falling, head over heels for you"
head over heels heart over mind you've got me body and soul
i've never dreamed in a million years i'd lose complete control
i'm head over heels for you
and all of the things you do
the heavens and earth have moved
i'm falling head over heels for you
head over heels for you
i'm falling head over heels for you
oooo ohh i'm falling
mmmm i'm falling
how long will i love you
i don't really know
i'd like to think forever
is how far we could go
so let me paint a picture
of how it's gonna be
the day you don't mean everything to me
when a nickel's worth a dollar
and gold ain't worth a dime
when they build a ship on waters that will take you back in time
when the stars have all been counted
and i stop lovin' you
honey they'll be driving buicks to the moon
now you don't have to worry
about what comes to pass
this old world may wear out
but my love's gonna last
if they ever build that highway to the moon
i'll just find something else to promise you
when a nickel's worth a dollar
and gold ain't worth a dime
when they build a ship on waters that will take you back in time
when the stars have all been counted
and i stop lovin' you
honey they'll be driving buicks to the moon
oh when the stars have all be counted
and i stop lovin' you
honey they'll be drivin' buicks to the moon

mhm when you're not strong and need someone to lean on
let me be your strenght when you're weak
when you need somebody to comfort and love you let mine be the arms that you
seek
i want to be what you need whatever it is come to me
you'll always know where i'll be cause i want to be what you need
when life gets to be more than you can endure my hand is always in reach
and i'm always waiting and i'm always willing to give you whatever you need
i want to be what you need...
yes i want to be what you need
i get this going fever everytime i hear a tune
that talks about south texas where the cactus is in bloom
i feel i oughta be there every evening after dark
to hear the fiddler fiddlin' around a tune called old joe clark
we played that show in tulsa then it was ft worth bound
we headed south on 35 to that south texas town
it's a different world and a lot of fun if you like that country sound
you can find yourself a partner when they boil that cabbage down
if you're ever down in texas and feeling all alone
there's a lot of kicker places just south of san antone
ain't nothin' fancy mind ya just a place where good folks go
you can hear the bootheels start to click when they play the cotton eyed joe
"(alan jackson, ron jackson, andy loffin)"
well i was sitting in a roadhouse down on highway 41
you were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
"i knw you didn't see me, i was in a corner booth"
of course you weren't my waitress mine was missing her front tooth
so i flagged you down for coffee
but i couldn't say a thing
but i'm in love with you baby and i don't even know your name
"i'm in love with you baby, i don't even know your name"
i've never been to good at all these sexual games
so maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
i'm in love with you baby and i don't even know your name
"so i ordered straight tequila, a little courage in a shot"
i asked you for a date and then i asked to tie the knot
"i got a little wasted, yeah i went a little far"
but i finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
the last thing i remember i heard myself say
"i'm in love with you baby, i don't even know your name"
"i'm in love with you baby, i don't even know your name"
i've never been to good at all these sexual games
so maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
i'm in love with you baby and i don't even know your name
"the next thing i remember, i was hearing wedding bells"
standing by a woman in a long white lacy veil
"i raised the veil, she smiled at me without her left front tooth"
and i said 'where the heel am i and just who the hell are you?'
she said 'i was your waitress and our last name's now the same'
'cause i;m married to you baby and i don't even know your name
"i'm married to a waitress, i don't even know her name"
i've never been to good at all these sexual games
i never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
hey i'm married to a waitress and i don't even know her name
well i'll never forget the first time that i heard
that pretty mouth say that dirty word
and i can't even remember now what she backed my truck into
but she covered her mouth and her face got red
and she just looked so damn cute
that i couldn't even act like i was mad
yeah i live for little moments like that
well that's just like last year on my birthday
she lost all track of time and burnt the cake
and every smoke detector in the house was goin' off
and she was just about the cry until i took her in my arms
and i tried not to let her see me laugh
yeah i live for little moments like that
i know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for me
and i thank god that she isn't 'cause how boring would that be
it's the little imperfections it's the sudden change in plans
when she misreads the directions and we're lost but holdin' hands
yeah i live for little moments like that
when she's layin' on my shoulder on the sofa in the dark
and about the time she falls asleep so does my right arm
and i want so bad to move it 'cause it's tinglin' and it's numb
but she looks so much like an angel that i don't wanna wake her up
yeah i live for little moments
when she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it
yeah i live for little moments like that
you know people been talking about the end of time ever since time began
we've been living in the last days ever since the first day ever since the dawn of man
well nobody knows when the end is coming but some people tell you they do
"well it might be today, it might be tomorrow, or in a million years or two..."
"in the meantime, in between time, let us make time to make it right"
"and let us not fear what is not clear; faith should be your guide, just follow this advice.."
and...
think about love; think about living
think about love sharing and giving
drop the doomsday attitude and let the spirit flow
these are wonderful times we're living in
god still walks in the hearts of men
and eden's garden waves within so let the flowers grow
"well we rant and we rave about the ""good ol' days"" and how different it was ""back then"""
well the greatest days we've ever known are the days we're living in
"well we worry about earthquakes, aliens from outer space, nuclear holocaust"
well we're so consumed with the fear of dying; the joy of living is lost
"in the meantime, in between time, let us make time to make amends"
"lead the good life, just treat this planet right and try to all be friends and say with me again.."
ohhh...!
think about life; think about living
think about love - caring and giving
drop this doomsday attitude and get on with the show
we've walked on the moon; been to mars
technically we've come so far
but still we wonder who we are
the farther along we go
(doodle-doodle doo-doo-doo... ooh-ooh)
you know people been talking about the end of time ever since time began
we've been living in the last days ever since the first day ever since the dawn of man
well nobody knows when the end is coming—well that's what the scriptures say
"but that's a secret known only to god, he says to just watch and pray"
"in the meantime, what's the hurry?"
in the meantime now don't you worry
"in the meantime live, laugh- be merry"
"in the meantime, in the meantime"
in the meantime troubles gonna show us
in the meantime the sky is still above us
in the meantime you know god's gonna love us
"in the meantime, in the meantime, in the meantime..."

you'll cry and cry and try to sleep
but sleep won't come the whole night through
your cheatin' heart will tell on you
when tears come down like fallin' rain
you'll toss around and call my name
you'll walk the floor the way that i do
your cheatin' heart will tell on you
your cheatin' heart will pine someday
and crave the love you threw away
the time will come when you'll be blue
your cheatin' heart will tell on you
when tears come down like fallin' rain
you'll toss around and call my name
you'll walk the floor the way i do
your cheatin' heart will tell on you

though the miles are between us
i thought our love would strengthen
as it has so many times before
but something has happened
i can see it in your eyes
i can feel my world is crumblin'
and the blues are at my door
the last letter that you wrote was
on a blue piece of paper
that old feelin's back
the clouds are movin' in
the beginning of the end is near
i feel your love has faded into darkness
it seems i have no friend
i feel the blues movin' in
oh it's not the words you wrote that made me sad
and broken-hearted
that's put me in this sad shape i'm in
between the lines are mixed emotions
and there's teardrops on the paper
you said that's all i'll write today
i'll cose for now old friend
my state of mind is desperate
and this hole that i'm sinkin' in
gets deeper while i'm diggin' to get out
oh please give the right answer to the questions i'm askin'
tell me you still love me
that would turn my world about
i guess i finally found what i do best
i always knew there was something i'd be good at
every man has something he does better than the rest
i still can't believe how much i miss you
and i guess i finally found what i do best
when it came to lovin' oh you were something
i took all the love you gave and i surely made a mess
yes i lost in love but in sadness i've been succesful
yes i guess i finally found what i do best
they say that every man has given talent
but if hurtin' is a talent then i know that i've been blessed
oh missing you just seems to come so natural
and i guess i finally found what i do best
oh if there's something i wish i wasn't good at
but i guess i deserve what i do best
as i turn out the light and bow my head to pray
the answered prayer i'm thankful for
is i made it through today
well her leavin' took its toll on me
and it took a lot of faith
to find the strength to carry on
but i made it through today
oh i was guilty of takin' her heart for granted
lettin' love slip through my hands
'til i was empty-handed
and now i know how much i have and i ain't gonna lose it
'cause i've been given a second chance
and i intend to use it
i'm not tryin' to change the world
i'm just tryin' to find my way
and i still stumble now and then
but i made it through today
whoa i was guilty of takin' this life for granted
lettin' time slip through my hands
'til i was empty-handed
now i know how much i have and i ain't gonna lose it
'cause i've been given a second chance
and i intend to use it
as i turn out the light and bow my head to pray
the answered prayer i'm thankful for
is i made it through today
mmm-mmm i made it through today
mmm-mmm i made it through today
mm-hmm mm-hmm
we always wanted a big two story house
back when we lived in that little two room shack
we wanted fame and fortune
and we'd live life the way the rich folks do
"we knew some how we'd make it, together me and you"
with dreams and hopes of things to come
we worked and never stopped
not much time for you and me
we had to reach the top
we bought that big two story house
and soon became the envy of the town
with all our work behind us
we'd finally settled down
now we live (yes we live) in a two story house
"whoa, what splendor"
but there's no love about
i've got my story
"and i've got mine, too"
"how sad it is, we now live, in a two story house"
the house is filled with rare antiques
there's marble on the floor
beauty all around us
like we've never seen before
there's chandeliers in every room
imported silks and satin all about
we filled the house with everything
but somehow left love out
now we live (yes we live) in a two story house
oh what splendor
but there's no love about
i've got my story
"and i've got mine, too"
"how sad it is, we now live, in a two story house"
the bright lights of the city are a pretty site to see
perhaps they're extra pretty to a country girl like me
temptation waits at every turn and it won't let me be
so mama when you pray tonight
say a special prayer for me
i miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding
the good-night kisses i get now are cruel and so demanding
so mama when you pray tonight
and while you're on your knees
mama say a special prayer for me
the nights get cold and lonely
when you're faraway from home
and lonely makes it easy for a good girl to go wrong
evil eyes search through the night for lonely girls like me
so mama when you pray tonight
say a special prayer for me
i miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding
these good-night kisses i get now are cruel and so demanding
so mama when you pray tonight
and while you're on your knees
mama say a special prayer for me
all aboard america here comes the freedon train
all aboard america here comes the freedon train
the freedom train is rolling down two hundred years of track
two hundred years of glory never to turn back
the train is called america your ticket is a dream
that left the torture of freedom for all the world to see
she left the station in lexington in 1776
and rode to philadelphia where the liberty bell was fixed
george washington was the engineer john adams shovelled coal
and franklin punched the tickets tom jefferson added soul
all aboard america here comes the freedon train
she rode to new orleans the battle of 1812
with old hickory at the throttle she drove the british out
the freedom train's a fine train the toppest of world it seemed
her whistle blows for the liberty with a mighty head of steam
wheels of fortune sweaty pittsburg rolled across the mississipp'
from texas to misoury to one real exciting trip
then bang of track was broken smashed by a cannonball
that blew in great divided will the nation stand or fall
all aboard america here comes the freedon train
will annistage stepped into the cab and the wheels began to roll
freedom train must never stop republic never fall
to the bloody fields of gettysburg the tear show in his eyes
she drove the train with fury the freedom train survive
again the train rode westward to california shores
to the deserts and prairies even stronger than before
from atlantic to pacific she drove the rail with pride
she travelled a track to glory with the good lord on her side
all aboard america here comes the freedon train
there's much more to this story like wilson and roosevelt
they left the train to truman who stoked it mighty well
then old dwight d eisenhower or lbj we sing
two brothers known as kennedy and martin luther king
and still the train rolls forward over history's rugged trail
straightin' by the journey and the land beneath her rail
and you and i roll along and stroke the freedom fire
for we stand to all americans hold old honor can't be hired
all aboard america here comes the freedon train
i've seen the south of france
i've seen the sunset dance
over sunset avenue
i've seen the rolling stones
got real high on rock n roll
seen a lot of dreams come true
but ain't no moment like when i'm holding onto you
ain't no moment like when i'm holding onto you
baby you're above the years
i've been moved to tears
by the wonders of this old world
one of god's mysteries
didn't ever fail to get to me
is the moment when i'm holdin onto you
ain't no moment like when i'm holding onto you
i've seen a newborn child
puts stars in her mamas eyes
and i pray to the man in the moon
i got drunk with the highway men
felt the burn of the desert wind
seen some promise and i do's
ain't no moment like when i'm holding onto you
ain't no moment like when i'm holding onto you
baby you're above the years
i've been moved to tears
by the wonders of this old world
one of god's mysteries
it never fails to get to me
is the moment when i'm holding onto you
ain't no moment like when i'm holding onto you
baby we just rolled in
it's cold here in michigan
got a sold-out show tonight
pretty soon we'll hit the stage
i'll feel the lights hit my face
we'll see some magic in the room
ain't no moment like when i'm holding onto you
ain't no moment like when i'm holding onto you
no no no no
ain't no moment like when i'm holding onto you
ain't no moment like when i'm holding onto you
i'm waitin' on the sun to set
'cause yesterday ain't over yet
i started smoking cigarettes
"there's nothing else to do, i guess"
dusty roads ain't made for walking
spinning tires ain't made for stoppin'
i'm giving up on love
'cause love's given up on me
i gave it everything i had
and everything i got was bad
life ain't hard but it's too long
to live it like some country song
trade the truth in for a lie
cheating really ain't a crime
i'm giving up on love
'cause love's given up on me
forget you high society
i'm soakin' it in kerosene
light 'em up and watch them burn
teach them what they need to learn ha!
dirty hands ain't made for shakin'
ain't a rule that ain't worth breakin'
well i'm giving up on love
'cause love's given up on me
"now, i don't hate the one who left"
you can't hate someone who's dead
he's out there holding on to someone
i'm holding up my smoking gun
i'll find somewhere to lay my blame
the day she changes her last name
well i'm giving up on love
'cause love's given up on me
well i'm giving up on love
"hey, love's given up on me"
there's a fork in the road
on my way home
"temptation waits: wine, women, and song"
lord my will breaks
where that road bends
and tonight i took a turn for the worse again
left was home
right was wrong
and you can bet by now she knows which road i'm on
it's a road i know like the back of my hand
but tonight i took a turn for the worse again
my old truck
pulls a little to the right
seems to get a lot worse on friday night
things are bad at home
lord i'm sick of work
so tonight i took a turn for the worse
january's always bitter
"but lord, this one beats all"
the wind ain't quit for weeks now
and the drifts are ten feet tall
i been all night drivin' heifers
closer in to lower ground
then i spent the mornin' thinkin'
'bout the ones the wolves pulled down.
charlie barton and his family
stopped today to say goodbye
he said the bank was takin' over
the last few years were just too dry
and i promised that i'd visit
when they found a place in town
then i spent a long time thinkin'
'bout the ones the wolves pull down.
"lord, please shine a light of hope"
on those of us who fall behind
and when we stumble in the snow
could you help us up while there's still time.
"well, i don't mean to be complainin' lord"
you've always seen mme through
and i know you got your reasons
for each and every thing you do
but tonight outside my window
"there's a lonesome, mournful sound"
and i just can't keep from thinkin'
'bout the ones the wolves pull down.
"oh lord, keep me from bein'"
the one the wolves pull down
you're just as good as gone
you've been leaving for so long
"ain't been yours, you ain't been mine"
it's been over for quite some time
so go ahead walk on out the door
you don't love me anymore
we know that this just can't drag on
it's too bad you're just as good as gone
i see that you've made up your mind
and goodbye's for good this time
no need to fight no need to fuss
it's too late for the two of us
i feel so bad i feel so blue
in my heart i know that we are through
i'm losing you and oh lonely won
"it's obvious, you're just as good as gone"
you're just as good as gone
you've been leaving for so long
"ain't been yours, you ain't been mine"
it's been over for quite some time
so go ahead walk on out the door
you don't love me anymore
we know that this just can't drag on
it's too bad you're just as good as gone
you're just as good as gone
you've been leaving for so long
"ain't been yours, you ain't been mine"
it's been over for quite some time
so go ahead walk on out the door
you don't love me anymore
we know that this just can't drag on
it's too bad you're just as good as gone
it's so sad you're just as good as gone
it's you that
i run to
whenever i need to
"darling, you console me"
when trouble surrounds me
when bad times have found me
just reach out your arms and hold me
hold me
hold me
darling please take me
in your arms of safety
reach out your arms
and hold me
hold me
when my feelings are showing
when my tears are flowing
just reach out
reach out and hold me
hold me
hold me
you know all of my needs
you fill them completely
you know
that you control me
i depend on
your lovin'
without you
i'm nothin'
so reach out
your arms and hold me
hold me
hold me
darling please take me
in your arms of safety
reach out you arms
and hold me
hold me
when life is demanding
when i need understanding
reach out
reach out and hold me
hold me
hold me
sad songs sound sadder
on an old gibson
it only gets better
played a thousand times
like an old georgia pine can't pick up and run from its roots
"home is still home, no matter which road you choose"
you can't put reins on a wild palomino
you won't see an old cowboy cry
long as god's still in church
and hard work still works
and this collar on my shirt's still blue
i'll never stop lovin' you
a broke heart keeps breaking
sitting at a bar
whiskey's a band-aid
it just leaves more scars
like an old georgia pine can't pick up and run from its roots
"home is still home, no matter which road you choose"
you can't put reins on a wild palomino
you won't make a rolling stone stay
long as god's still at church
and hard work still works
and that collar on my shirt's still blue
i'll never stop lovin' you
i can't change your mind
can't change the weather
if you need some time to run free
i made you a promise
for worse or for better
even though missing you's killin' me
you can't put reins on a wild palomino
and you won't see this old cowboy cry
long as god's still in church
and hard work still works
and that collar on my shirt's still blue
i'll never stop lovin' you
i'll never stop lovin' you
"i've had good luck, and bad luck"
"and no luck, it's true"
but i always get lucky with you
"i've been turned on, and turned down"
when the bars close at two
but i always get lucky with you
i've had two strikes against me
most all of the time
and when it's down to just a phone call
i'm minus a dime
"i've had good days, and bad days"
but when the day is through
i always get lucky with you
"oh, i always get lucky with you"
memories and drinks don't mix too well.
jukebox records don't play those wedding bells.
"lookin' at the world through the bottom of a glass,"
all i see is a man who's fading fast.
tonight i need that woman again.
what i'd give for my baby to just walk in.
"sit down beside me and say: ""it's alright."
"""take me home and make sweet love to me tonight."""
"but here i am again, mixin' misery and gin."
sittin' with all my friends and talkin' to myself.
"i look like i'm havin' a good time but any fool can tell,"
that this honky tonk heaven really makes ya' feel like hell.
"i light a lonely woman's cigarette,"
we both start talkin' 'bout what we want to forget.
her life story and mine are the same.
we both lost someone and only have ourselves to blame.
"but here i am again, mixin' misery and gin."
sittin' with all my friends and talkin' to myself.
"i look like i'm havin' a good time but any fool can tell,"
that this honky tonk heaven really makes ya' feel like hell.
joy to the world! the lord has come:
let earth receive her king.
"let every heart prepare him room,"
"and heaven and nature sing, and heaven and nature sing,"
and heaven and heaven and nature sing.
joy to the world! the savior reigns:
"let men their songs employ,"
"while fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains,"
"repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy,"
"repeat, repeat the sounding joy."
"he rules the world with truth and grace,"
and makes the nations prove
the glories of his righteousness
"and wonders of his love, and wonders of his love"
"and wonders, wonders of his love."

he's a giver he'll give her the kind of attention that she's never known
he's a helper he'll help her to open the doors that she can't on her own
he's a lover and he'll love her in ways that she's never been loved before
he's a getter he'll get her by gettin' her into the world she's been hungering for
he's a charmer he'll charm her with money and manners that i never learned
he's a talker he'll talk her right off of her feet but he won't talk for long
cause he's a doer and he'll do her
the way that i'd never damned if he won't do her wrong
he's a taker he'll take her to places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
he'll take his time before takin' advantage takin' her easy and slow
and after he's taken the body and soul she gives him he'll take her for granted
take off and leave her taken all of her pride when he goes
he's a taker he'll take her...
like a cigarette without a light
like a whipper wheel without the night
a broken buzz that's lost it's high
"oh, baby, that's what i feel like"
"i'm so low, i'm so low"
like a diamond ring without a stone
like a guitar without a song
everything that was right is wrong
"ever since, baby, you been gone"
"i'm so low, i'm so low"
"yeah, i'm low and blue"
i'm so lonesome for you
"oh, yeah"
"oh, whoa, oh"
"yeah, yeah"
"oh, i've hit rock bottom, i'm in it deep"
"i can't get no air, i can't get no sleep"
without you by my side
"i tried to see the light, baby, but i can't"
'cause way down here in the world
"i am, the sun don't shine"
"'cause i'm low, low, low, low"
i'm so low
i'm so tangled up and blue
i'm so lonesome for you
and i don't know what to do
'cause i'm so lonesome for you
"yeah, i'm so lonesome for you"
where does a little tear come from where does a little tear come from
it comes from a heart that's been broken apart
that's where a little tear comes from
where does the broken heart come from where does the broken heart come from
it comes when you find that you love the roving kind
that's where the broken heart comes from
where does the roving kind come from where does the roving kind come from
from the wild and restless river that wanders on forever
that's where the roving kind comes from
where does the restless river come from where does the restless river come from
it comes from little tears that i shed through the years
that's where the restless river comes from
where does a little tear come from
love so cruel
yeah that's all that i got from you
tell me what in the world could i do
but leave after all that you've done to me
now it's so easy to say i'm over you
"'cause baby i cried a little too hard, a little too long"
what i thought was right was way too wrong
and too far gone
i can't bring back the love
there just ain't enough
"available, impossible, unsaveable"
here you come tryin' to make up fpr what you've done
it's too late to say you're sorry now
now it's your turn
you're on your owm
when will you learn
love
there's someone out there for me
who thinks i'm beautiful
i've got to go
i forgot to forget
now i live to regret
like when we walked away
all the words i didn't say
could've changed things i did
now i try to break down
that our love could've end
though i swore i wouldn't [?]
or recall the day we met
i forgot to forget
i forgot to forget
your love alone
now memory has said
on your grace and charm
i never look at the moon
or think of the star
we laugh at her
beating in my heart
i forgot to forget
now i live to regret
like when we walked away
all the words i didn't say
could've changed things i did
now i try to break down
that our love could've end
though i swore i wouldn't [?]
or recall the day we met
i forgot to forget
"set me free, set me free, set me free"
"i am a look at the moon, or think of the star"
"well now that hurt, we can [?] heart"
i forgot to forget
now i live to regret
like when we walked away
all the words i didn't say
could've changed things i did
now i try to break down
that our love could've end
though i swore i wouldn't [?]
or recall the day we met
i forgot to forget
though i never would've bet
how my mind is so sad
i forgot to forget
now my memory is gonna
and the heart is wanna get
'cause i forgot to forget
oh i forgot to forget
"oh, holy night"
the stars
are brightly shining
it is the night of the dear
saviour's birth
long lay the world in sin
and error pining
'til he appeared
and the soul felt
it's worth a thrill of hope
the weary world rejoices
for yonder breaks a new
and glorious morn
fall on your knees
"oh, hear the angel voices"
"oh, night divine"
"oh, night"
when christ was born
"oh, night divine"
oh night
"oh, holy night"
fall on your knees
"oh, hear the angel voices"
"oh, night divine"
"oh, night"
when christ was born
"oh, night divine"
"oh, night"
"oh, holy night"

"hey girl, i wanna give you some friendly advice"
"he's got you cryin', oh he's done it again"
he's made a date and he didn't show
you know he's done this to you so many times
when you gonna let him go
he doesn't treat you little a lover should
he could be so downright cruel
can't understand why you're hangin' with him
"girl, don't you be a fool"
go on and dump the dude
you know he's got a rotten attitude
he always leaves you in a cryin' mood
"take my advice, don't you think twice"
listen to what i'm telling you
go on and dump the dude
you know that we've been friends for so many years
and i've never ever seen you this way
"so torn apart, how he gets to your heart"
with all the little games that he plays
"just give him up, get him out of your life"
promise me that once and for all
you're gonna tell him that it's over and done
"the very next time he calls, ain't you now"
dump the dude
you know he's got a rotten attitude
he always leaves you in a cryin' mood
"take my advice, find somebody nice"
listen to what i'm telling you
go on and dump the dude
"girl, i know you may think this is none of my business"
but the fact that we're friends i believe that makes it my business
i care about you but i ain't preachin'
i think you should dump the dude
i don't know why you'd want to settle for less
when you could have so much more
you know that you deserve only the best
so what are you waiting for?
go on and dump the dude
you know he's got a rotten attitude
he always leaves you in a cryin' mood
"take my advice, don't you think twice"
find yourself somebody nice
go on and dump the dude
i've got a never ending love for you
"from now on, that's all i want to do"
from the first time we met i knew
i'd have a never ending love for you
after all this time of being alone
we can love one another
feel for each other
from now on
feel so good i can hardly stand it
"i live for the phone, i die for the mail"
i took your picture right off the nail
and put it right by my bed
so i could see you instead
of the darkness of night
i hold conversations with you in my mind
they only tighten the knot deep inside
and teh aching won't end
'til i hold you again
if i only survive
why did you have to go
why am i missing you so
one heartbeat at a time
i'm going out of my mind
"missing you, missing you"
"i started a letter, i stared at your name"
there wasn't a line that didn't echo my pain
there was no sound at all
but the slow lonely fall
of an unspoken tear
why did you have to go
why am i missing you so
one heartbeat at a time
i'm going out of my mind
"missing you, missing you"
life may take us in different directions
"but i always end up deeper, deeper in my true affection"
why did you have to go
why am i missing you so
one heartbeat at a time
i'm going out of my mind
"missing you, missing you"

in my mind i've made love to you often but only in my mind can it be so
cause there's someone at home that's countin' on me
and if i did i'm sure that he would know
yes he would know yes he could tell
for he has loved me long enough to know me very well
and if i lie he sees it in my eyes i know my guilt would show and he would know
but i must admit you're someone very special and it would be so easy to let go
making love to you could be so easy but if i did i'm sure that he would know
yes he would know...
my conscience just won't let me make love to you
i know it would be sweet but i just can't
when i go home to him i must be able to look him in the eyes and say i ain't
cause he would know...
"standing on the promises of christ my king,"
through eternal ages let his praises ring;
"glory in the highest, i will shout and sing,"
standing on the promises of god.
refrain:
"standing, standing,"
standing on the promises of god my savior;
"standing, standing,"
i'm standing on the promises of god.

"i've had good luck, and bad luck"
"and no luck, it's true"
but i always get lucky with you
"i've been turned on, and turned down"
when the bars close at two
but i always get lucky with you
i've had two strikes against me
most all of the time
and when it's down to just a phone call
i'm minus a dime
"i've had good days, and bad days"
but when the day is through
i always get lucky with you
(darrell brown/radney foster)
it ticks just like a timex
it never lets up on you
who said life was easy
the job is never through
it'll run us 'til we're ragged
it'll harden our hearts
and love could use a day of rest
before we both start falling apart
i pray that it's raining on sunday
stormin' like crazy
we'll hide under the covers all afternoon
baby whatever comes monday
can take care of itself
'cause we've got better things that we can do
when it's raining on sunday
your love is like religion
a cross in mexico
and your kiss is like the innocence
of a prayer nailed to a door
oh surrender is much sweeter
when we both let it go
let the water wash our bodies clean
and love wash our souls
and pray that it's raining on sunday
stormin' like crazy
and we'll hide under the covers all afternoon
and baby whatever comes monday
can take care of itself
'cause we've got better things that we can do
when it's raining on sunday
"ooh, oh oh"
i pray that it's raining on sunday
stormin' like crazy
we'll hide under the covers all afternoon
and baby whatever comes monday
can take care of itself
'cause we've got better things that we can do
when it's raining on sunday
"ooh, oh oh"
when it's raining on sunday
when it's raining on sunday
let it rain
how long has it taken me to find you?
"500 years, 500 thousand miles"
it don’t matter now
love’s always on time
meet me underneath the oklahoma sky
"lightening flashed, everything went silent"
a feather could have knocked me to the floor
missing piece was found
i was finally alive
meet me underneath the oklahoma sky
with the speed of sound
i’m homeward bound
mmmhmmm
all our sorrows swept away forever
each and every tear washed out to sea
there ain’t no goodbye with your hand in mine
meet me underneath the oklahoma sky
oklahoma sky
lately you leave me in a cold state of mind
your goodbyes are never on time
the blues just keep coming and drying out your eyes
"don't you think i feel it, too?"
"a slow train, a cold rain, i'm all inside out"
the lights just aren't shining on me
"to live it again, i'd believe in a lie"
"don't you think i feel it, too?"
"in a world of my own, where the ground is my home"
"and the lights, they shine only from the sky"
"like you, like a fool, i'm lost in the blues"
"and don't you think i feel it, too?"
"in a world of my own, where the ground is my home"
"and the lights, they shine only from the sky"
"like you, like a fool, i'm lost in the blues"
"and don't you think i feel it, too?"
lately you leave me in a cold state of mind
your goodbyes are never on time
the blues just keep coming and drying out your eyes
"and don't you think i feel it, too?"
"and don't you think i feel it, too?"
there's a mountain dew can with lipstick on it
rollin' round his truck bed.
"he just leaves it back there,"
one of the things he still has left of her
when he drives into the late day sun
you can see a set of footprints.
"he ain't going to clean that windshield,"
he'd rather just live with the hurt.
he's holdin' on to the wheel
to the way she made him feel.
"to the shifter, to the pictures."
every precious moment with her.
like the left behind colors in the sky
when the sun is gone.
he's holdin' on.
"oh, he's holdin' on."
there's that voicemail on his cell phone
he don't dare erase.
"she ended with i love you,"
and he saves it just in case
it might still be true.
no he ain't through.
to the past
to the last time he held her
the breath on his neck.
the three words she said.
oh oh oh
he's holdin' on to the wheel
to the way she made him feel.
"to the shifter, to the pictures."
every precious moment with her.
he's holdin' on
"yeah, he's holdin' on"
he's holdin' on
he's holdin on
"she said, ""please don't let me go"""
"i said, ""i gotta let you go"""
and love just laughed
that's all that i remember
it was a bitter cold december
and love just laughed
love is still laughing
but you can't go back
what's done is done
"yeah, that's a fact"
but it was fun in a strange kind of way
we can look back and smile and say
"""whatever happened brought us down to the day"""
that love just laughed
and then love cried
"i said, ""where are you going? """
we're just getting started
and love just laughed
we were meant forever
but that's turned into never
and love just laughed
love is still laughing
but you can't go back
what's done is done
and that's a fact
but it was fun in a strange kind of way
we can look back and smile and say
"""whatever happened brought us down to the day"""
love just laughed
and then love cried
love is still laughing
but you can't go back
what's done is done
that's a fact
but it was fun in a strange kind of way
we can look back and smile and say
"""whatever happened brought us down to the day"""
and love just laughed
and then love cried
and then love cried
"when it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do"
"when it's family, you accept them, 'cause you have no choice but to"
"when it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you"
and they always put you to the test
and you always try to do your best
"and just pray for god to do the rest, when it's family"
"some are preachers, some are gay"
"some are addicts, drunks and strays"
"but not a one is turned away, when it's family"
"some are lucky, others ain't"
"some are fighters, others faint"
"winners, losers, sinners, saints, it's all family"
and when it's family you trust them and your heart's an open door
"when it's family, you tolerate what you'd kill others for"
"when it's family, you love and hate and take, then give some more"
"somehow you justify mistakes, try to find some better way"
"to solve the problems day to day, in the family"
you take the trouble as it comes and love them more than anyone
"good or bad or indifferent, it's still family"
"you choose your lovers, you pick your friends"
"not the family that you're in, nah"
"they'll be with you 'til the end, 'cause it's family"
"and when it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do"
"when it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you"
"when it's family, when it's family"
let me be all that i should be to the family
i'm her world and she revolves around me
juest being close to me makes her love grow
each night she thanks god ofr the day she found me
"why, when she came home this morning, she told me so"
and there's roses blooming in the arctic circle
icebergs in the gulf of mexico
and there's not one star in heaven
or a sunrise every morning
i'd believe it if she tole me so
i know people say she has a lover
reffering to this guy she's come to know
"well, they're just friends,"
and she loves him like a brother
"nd she's never even kissed him, she told me so"
and there's roses blooming in the arctic circle
icebergs in the gulf of mexico
and there's not one star in heaven
and 8 don't follow 7
i'd believe her if she told me so
"well, it won't be long now"
til that 'ol sun goes down
and darkness helps me hide my shameful tears.
my wife works all night long
for a man who's halfway gone
she's the barmaid in the honky-tonk downstairs.
it's a shame she wears the name
of a man who's locked and chained
to a bottle that's destroyin' all hopes and cares.
to the men with hungry eyes
she works and hides her pride
she's the barmaid in the honky-tonk downstairs.
"one, two, three, go"
"hmm, now lately i've been livin' in a world that's black and white"
ever since you left all the colors just drained out of my life
and i've been goin' through the motions
"i can feel myself, slippin' away, slippin' away"
"i keep thinking 'bout that summer, south daytona beach"
"we never left the bed, no, we never got no sleep"
"and i've been lookin' back and thinking 'bout, the way it was"
"the way we were, we were reckless, so reckless"
"when i was with you, baby, i was superman"
"yeah, we were sky high, there was nothing better"
"when i was with you, grabbin' that live wire"
where we were johnny and june in a ring of fire
now you're caught up in my head like a melody
of the sweetest summer song that we used to sing
"ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh"
when i was with you (when i was with you)
"on some starry summer nights, i still wonder where you are"
are you still breakin' all the hearts of all the boys that play guitar?
and just goin' through the motions of emotions
"i've been slippin' away, slippin' away"
"hmm, but even with all that, girl, i'd still trade a few heartbeats"
"for one more sleepless night, tangled up between your sheets"
and i've been lookin' back and thinking 'bout the way it was
the way we were and those hundred mile [in our?] curves
"when i was with you, baby, i was superman"
"yeah, we were sky high, there was nothing better"
"when i was with you, grabbin' that live wire (live wire)"
where we were johnny and june in a ring of fire
now you're caught up in my head like a melody
of the sweetest summer song that we used to sing
"ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh"
when i was with you (when i was with you)
oh
when i was with you
"oh, now you're caught up in my head like a melody"
of the sweetest summer song that we used to sing
"ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh (ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)"
when i was with you (when i was with you)
"hey, hey, hey"
funny a woman can come on so wild and free
yet insist i don't watch her undresses or watch her watch me
and stand by the bed and shiver as if she were cold
just to lie down beside me and touch me as if i were gold
one night of love don't make up for six nights alone
i'd rather have one than none lord i'm flesh and bone
though sometimes it seems she ain't worth the trouble at all
she can be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all<br>
right or wrong a woman can own any man
she can take him inside her and hold his soul in her hand
then leave him as weary and weak as a newborn child
fighting to get his first breath and open his eyes
one night of love...
[ guitar ]
love doesn't come with a contract
"you give me this, i give you that."
it's scary business.
your heart and soul is on the line.
"baby, why else would i be standin' 'round here"
so tongue tied?
"if i knew what i was doing,"
i'd be doing it right now.
and i would be the best damn poet;
silver words out of my mouth.
"my words might not be magic,"
but they cut straight to the truth.
"so if you need a lover and a friend,"
"baby, i'm in. i'm in."
"baby, come on in, the water's fine."
"i'll be right here, you take your time."
just let me hold you.
and we'll both take that leap of faith.
"it's like i told you, there's no guarantees when"
you feel this way.
"if i knew what i was doing,"
i'd be doing it right now.
and i would be the best damn poet;
silver words out of my mouth.
"my words might not be magic,"
but they cut straight to the truth.
"so if you need a lover and a friend,"
"baby, i'm in. i'm in."
"baby,i'm in, i'm in."
"baby, come here next to me"
i'll show you how good it can be
i'll breathe each breath you breathe;
"i can pour out everything i am,"
everything i am.
"if i knew what i was doing,"
i'd be doing it right now.
and i would be the best damn poet;
silver words out of my mouth.
"my words might not be magic,"
but they cut straight to the truth.
"oh, so if you need a lover and a friend,"
"yeah, if you need a lover and a friend,"
"ooh, baby, i'm in. i'm in."
"baby,i'm in. i'm in."
"baby, come here next to me"
i'll show you how good it can be
i'll breathe each breath you breathe;
i can pour out everything i am.
"baby, come here next to me;"
i'll show you how good it can be.
"baby, come here next to me;"
i'll show you how good it can be.
"baby, come here. baby, come here. baby, come here."

got an old slouch hat
got my roll on my shoulder
i'm as free as a breeze
and i do as i please
i'm just a bummin' around
i got a million friends
i don't feel any older
i got nothin' to lose
not even the blues
i'm just a bummin' around
and whenever worries
starts to botherin' me
i grab my coat and my old slouch hat
"i hit the trail again, you see"
i ain't got a dime
i don't care where i'm goin'
i got nothin' to lose
not even the blues
i'm just a bummin' around
i got an old slouch hat
got my roll on my shoulder
i'm as free as a breeze
and i do as i please
just a bummin' around
i got a million friends
don't feel any older
i got nothin' to lose
not even the blues
i'm just a bummin' around
and whenever worries
starts to botherin' me
i grab my coat and my old slouch hat
"i hit the trail again, you see"
i ain't got a dime
i don't care where i'm goin'
i got nothin' to lose
not even the blues
i'm just a bummin' around
from a shack by a mountain stream
to a room in new orleans
so far from my blue ridge mountain home
the men i meet ain't warm and friendly
like the one in old virginie
oh they ain't real like my blue ridge mountain boy
i was just a little past eighteen
when i came to new orleans
i'd never been beyond my home state line
there was a boy who loved me dearly
but i broke his heart severely
when i left my blue ridge mountain boy
life was dull in my hometown
lights were out when the sun went down
and i thought that city life was more my style
but nights get lonely away from home
and it's easy to go wrong
the men ain't kind like my blue ridge mountain boy
new orleans held things in store
things i'd never bargained for
and every night a different man knocks on my door
but late at night when all is still
i can hear a whippoorwill
as i cry for my blue ridge mountain boy
oh but i can never go back home
since the boy i love is gone
he grew tired of waiting for me to return
they say he married last october
but i never will get over
oh the sweet love of my blue ridge mountain boy
blue ridge mountain boy
now blue ain't the word for the way that i feel
and the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
this ain't no crazy dream i know that it's real
you're someone else's love now you're not mine
crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
while my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
my troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
but for now i'm just lonesome all the time
[ steel ]
so take all the treasured dreams i had for you and me
and take all the love i thought was mine
someday these crazy arms may hold somebody new
but for i'm just lonesome all the time
crazy arms that reach...
but for now i'm just lonesome all the time
she got that 'hey y'all' little southern draw
that she got from her mama
likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
she likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring
doesn't matter what we're listening to
spinning her around the living room
and i fall apart every time
she puts that beat in my chest
"pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder"
"taking my hand, pulling me up when i'm going under"
my dreams come alive when i wake up
and look in her eyes
she brings me back to life
"yes, she does"
she's got her feet on the dash
"hair blowing back, hand out the window"
making up half the words that she's singing
and she takes an hour to pick a movie out
five minutes in and she's passing out
and i wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping
i'd stay there forever if i could
doing nothing never felt so good
andi wish that i could stop time
she puts that beat in my chest
"pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder"
"taking my hand, pulling me up when i'm going under"
my dreams come alive when i wake up and look in her eyes
"she brings me back to life, oh yes she does"
"and i don't wanna think about where i would be without her, oh"
she puts that beat in my chest
"pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder"
"taking my hand, pulling me up when i'm going under"
my dreams come alive when i wake up
"and look in her eyes, woah"
"yeah, my dreams come alive when i wake up"
and look in her eyes
she brings me back to life
oh she does
back to life
been forever since i've been gone
haven't held you in so long
miss you more than words can say
guess we've got a little off track
but love knows a way back
through the storms and pouring rain
got my hands on the wheel and i'm flying
heart beat loud as the thunder rolls
lightnin' on the stampede of lightnin' roll
i'm bringing back the sunshine
bringing back the sunshine
"baby, it's about time, oh oh oh oh"
"every moment, every sweet kiss"
all the loving that we both missed
it's okay to let 'em go
yesterday's all forgotten
and today we start rocking
somewhere underneath the rainbow
got my hands on the wheel and i'm flying
heart beat loud as the thunder rolls
lightnin' on the stampede of lightnin' roll
i'm bringing back the sunshine
bringing back the sunshine
"baby, it's about time, oh oh oh oh"
"oh yeah, bringing back, ooh"
"ooh, bringing back the sunshine"
"baby, it's about time, oh oh oh oh"
bringing back the sunshine
"baby, it's about time, oh oh oh oh"
"bringing back, bringing back"
"oh, i'm bringing back the sunshine"
"baby, it's about time, oh oh oh oh"
"bringing back, ooh yeah"
the night never looked as dark as this
when the world slipped through you fingertips
"i held you close, the tears pouring down"
with thought of him spinning around
a spark of life like the wind to a flame
who can stand and who's to blame
who are we when we fail to cope
in the bad times is where we find our hope
we cannot answer and we'll never know
what is the basic question grows and grows
"it's a lifelong mystery, buried in the sand"
it's all a part of god's plan
so hold me tight through this lullabye
there's always tomorrow and the answer is life
who are we when we fail to cope
in the bad times is where we find our hope
we cannot answer and we'll never know
what is the basic question grows and grows
"it's a lifelong mystery, buried in the sand"
it's all a part of god's plan
they say a woman's a fool for weeping
a fool to break her own heart
but i can't hold the secret i'm keeping
i'm breaking apart
can't seem to mind my own business
whatever i try turns out wrong
i seem like my own false witness
and i can't go on
"i cover my ears, i close my eyes"
still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
telling me lies
you told me you needed my company
and i believed in your flattering ways
you told me you needed me forever
nearly gave you the rest of my days
should've seen you for what you are
should never have come back for more
should've locked up all my silver
brought the key right to your door
you don't know what a chance is
until you have to seize one
you don't know what a man is
until you have to please one
don't put your life in the hands of a man
with a face for every season
don't waste your time in the arms of a man
who's no stranger to treason
(willie nelson)
too many pain pills too much pot

is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
"do you miss me like i miss you, is it cloudy all the time"
do you tremble when the phone rings and you think i'm on the line
is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
does it thunder and lightnin' even when the sun shines
is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
is it raining at your place just like it is over here
if it is then sweetheart like me i know you're scared
i just called you to console you like any old friend would do
is it raining at your house and by the way i still love you

is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
he's five foot two and he's six feet four
he fights with missiles and with spears
he's all of thirty-one
and he's only seventeen
he's been a soldier for a thousand years
"he's a catholic, a hindu, an atheist, a jain"
a buddhist and a baptist and a jew
he knows he shouldn't kill
but he knows he always will
"kill you, my friend, for me and me for you"
"he's fighting for canada, he's fighting for france"
he's fighting for the usa
he's fighting for the russians
and he's fighting for japan
and he thinks he'll put an end to war that way
"he's fighting for democracy, he's fighting for the reds"
he says it's for the peace of all
he's the one who must decide
who's to live and who's to die
but he never sees the writing on the wall
but without him how would hitler have condemned them at dachau
without him caesar would have stood alone
he's the one who gives his body
as the weapon of the war
and without him all this killing can't go on
he's the universal soldier and he really is to blame
his orders come from far away no more
"they come from him, and you, and me"
"and brother, can't you see"
this is not the way to put an end to war
of all the people in this world why you and i
with lovers here and everywhere who don't care enough to try
why couldn't all the hurt we're feeling now have passed us by
couldn't love have picked a better place to die
and of all the hearts in all the world why yours and mine
with so many places love could die it's so much easier to find
but it's in our hearts it's in our bed and it's even in your eyes
couldn't love have picked a better place to die
somewhere out there there's lovers who want to be free
why couldn't love have died with them instead of here with you and me
oh but it's dead and gone and all these tears won't bring it back to life
couldn't love have picked a better place to die
oh but it's dead and gone and all these tears won't bring it back to life
couldn't love have picked a better place to die
"sleigh bells ring, are you listening"
"in the lane, snow is glistening"
a beautiful sight
we're happy tonight
walking in a winter wonderland
gone away is the bluebird
here to stay is a new bird
he sings a love song
as we go along
walking in a winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
then pretend that he is parson brown
he'll say: are you married?
we'll say: no man
but you can do the job
when you're in town
"later on, we'll conspire"
as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid
the plans that we've made
walking in a winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
and pretend that he's a circus clown
we'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
until the other kids knock him down
"when it snows, ain't it thrilling"
though your nose gets a chilling
"we'll frolic and play, the eskimo way"
walking in a winter wonderland
walking in a winter wonderland
walking in a winter wonderland
if she brings you happiness
then i wish you both the best
it's your happiness that matters most of all
but if she ever breaks your heart
if the teardrops ever start
i'll be there before the next teardrop falls
though it hurts to let you go
darling i want you to know
i'll run to you if ever you should call
and if i should ever hear
that she's made you shed a tear
i'll be there before the next teardrop falls
i'll be there anytime you need me by your side
to dry away each teardrop you've cried
if she ever leaves you blue
just remember i love you
and i'll be there
before the next teardrop falls
alli estare cuando me necesites a tu lado
para borrar cada lagrima que hayas llorado
if he ever leaves you blue
just remember i love you
and i'll be there
before the next teardrop falls
"i'll be there, i'll be there"
before the next teardrop falls
"written by b. bouton, f. dycus & b. yates"
i once stood in the darkness i couldn't see a light
backed up against the wall i built around my life
i'd run out of reasons to ever love again
but somehow you found a door and you came waltzing in
"walls can fall, storms can end"
"skys can clear, hearts can mend"
all it took was your sweet love to rise above it all
"you can build 'em strong and tall, but walls can fall"
here we stand together with stones enough to build
the past will fade behind us if we let the future shine
not a thing can come between us if we always keep in mind that
"he looked down into her brown eyes,"
"said, "" say a prayer for me."""
"she threw her arms around him,"
"whispered, ""god will keep us free."""
"and they could hear the riders comin,"
"he said, ""this is my last fight."
"if they take me back to texas,"
"they won't take me back alive."""
"and there were seven spanish angels,"
at the alter of the sun.
"they were prayin' for the lovers,"
in the valley of the gun.
"and when the battle stopped,"
and the smoke cleared.
there was thunder from the throne.
"and seven spanish angels,"
took another angel home.
"she reached down and picked the gun up,"
that lay smokin in his hand.
"said, ""father please forgive me,"
"i can't make it without my man."""
"and she knew the gun was empty,"
and she knew she couldn't win.
"but her final prayer was answered,"
when the rifles fired again.
"i’m gonna write a letter, gonna mail it today"
just as soon as i think of the words to say
i’ve been needing to send it for nearly a year
there’s a woman back home who’s waiting to hear
"i meant to tell you, dear susannah"
i’m a long way from louisiana and you
and i know i promised to be returning
just as soon as i’ve saved the money i’m earning for you
but i’m married to twins and i’m living in peru
"well, i’m gonna write a letter"
get it off my mind
but you know the words
are so hard to find
"sitting, thinking with my pen in my hand"
how can i make her understand?
"i meant to tell you, dear julia"
"i’m a long way from the states, mosquitoes and you"
i’ll send some money to help with the kids
i’d like to thank you for all that you did
"it’s true louisiana, and i’m with susannah, too"
"got me a letter, it arrived today"
the words i read just blew me away
i don’t believe i’ve ever felt so low
how could susannah treat me so?
"she said, “i meant to tell you, my sweet honey"
"i’m a long way from your love, your money and you"
please don’t think me under
and i do believe you’ll understand me too
i got a bar and grill with phil in kalamazoo
when i met him he was lonely from a love that went wrong
and i helped him to forgive about the life he have known
and i gave him the courage to start over again
yes it's funny how people change when true love steps in
and when i met her she was looking for a true and good time
and when she found out someone cared it changed her ways in her mind
and then i asked her to go with me i didn't care where she'd been
ain't it funny how people change when true love steps in
true love stepped in and i know it will last
if we live for tomorrow and forget about the past
for the first time in a long time we're happy again
yes it's funny how people change when true love steps in
yes it's funny how people change when true love steps in
o soul are you weary and troubled?
no light in the darkness you see?
"there's light for a look at the saviour,"
and life more abundant and free:
"turn you eyes upon jesus,"
look full in his wonderful face;
and the things of earth will grow strangely dim
in the light of his glory and grace.
through death into life everlasting
"he passed, and we follow him there;"
over us sin no more hath dominion
for more than conqu'rors we are!
his word shall not fail you he promised;
believe him and all will be well.
"then go to a world that is dying,"
his perfect salvation to tell!
what would your memories do
"writers hank cochran, dean dillon"
what would your memories do
if they didnâ€™t have my mind to run through
if they didnâ€™t have my heart to break into
what would your memories do
wonder what would happen
if one morning your memories woke up to find mine gone
would they go as crazy without me
as i have without you
would they last as long
what would your memories do
if someday they found the door to my mind
had been locked from inside by my heart
what would they do if they couldnâ€™t use you any longer
to tear me apart
"my oh my, you're so good-looking"
hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
but i've not tasted all your cooking
who are you when i'm not looking?
do you pour a little something on the rocks?
slide down the hallway in your socks?
"when you undress, do you leave a path?"
then sink to your nose in a bubble bath?
"my oh my, you're so good-looking"
hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
but i've not tasted all your cooking
who are you when i'm not looking?
i wanna know
i wanna know
i wanna know
do you break things when you get mad?
eat a box of chocolates 'cause you're feelin' bad?
do you paint your toes 'cause you bite your nails?
call up momma when all else fails?
who are you when i'm not around?
when the door is locked and the shades are down?
do you listen to your music quietly?
"and when it feels just right, are you thinkin' of me?"
i wanna know
i wanna know
i wanna know
"my oh my, you're so good-looking"
but who are you when i'm not looking?
"i'm driving home tonight, catching all red lights"

"breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass"

"so, i've been sleeping til noon in the same bedroom"
where i once held you and its breaking my heart
i should take down all those pictures from my wall
promises we made won't fill this empty space

"ooh, oh, oh, i know youre never coming back"
but in my mind were somewhere in my car

cause he knows he can change the world in his ordinary way
"she's got a job, she has a family"
she tries to keep them both together
"she's barely getting by, saving everything she makes"
day by day it seems it's getting harder to win

he promised her a life of luxury
and though they don't have riches they have everything they need
the eyes of her child are her diamonds
the gift of his love are her pearls

"but never breaking, knowing that their dreams will begin"
getting stronger in each other's arms
these are the times of the everyday hero
this is the battlefield of the modern world

there's a chosen road to follow
just remember nothing good comes easy

they got three in the front and four in the back of a civic

with their hands on the fence in the back by the buses and the limousines
just to get a glance at a drummer or singer yeah anything
and they come from miles around
for that moment when the lights go out
and they scream
it's the girls in the front row singin'

now it all begins
or continues to
spiral down

i've laid it out on paper
instructions of what to do
as my mind begins to waver
losing contact with you
now it all begins
or continues to
spiral down

look upon the self
look upon the other
we need a better understanding
or we'll spiral down

i'm no where near my peace
as you spiral down
tonight down here in the valley
i'm lonesome and oh how i feel
as i sit here alone in my cabin
i can see your mansion on the hill
do you recall when we parted
the story to me you revealed
you said you could live without loving
in your loveless mansion on the hill
i've waited all through the years love
to give you a heart true and real
cause i know you're living in sorrow
in your loveless mansion on the hill
the light shine bright from yer window
the trees stand so silent and still
i know you're alone with your pride dear
in your loveless mansion on the hill

there's a better home a-waiting

just like a willow
that bends to the water
and clings to the shore
and there was a time dear
that once you did love me
and there was a time
you loved me no more
rain on your window
light on your pillow
the way you lie sleeping
is it like before
for there was a time dear
that once you did love me
and there was a time
you loved me no more
your cheatin' heart
will make you weep
you'll cry and cry
and try to sleep.
but sleep won't come
the whole night through
your cheatin' heart
will tell on you.
when tears come down
like fallin' rain
you'll toss around
and call my name.
you'll walk the floor
the way i do
your cheatin' heart
will tell on you.
--- instrumental ---
your cheatin' heart
will pine someday
and crave the love
you threw away.
the time will come
when you'll be blue
your cheatin' heart
will tell on you.
when tears come down
like fallin' rain
you'll toss around
and call my name.
you'll walk the floor
the way i do
your cheatin' heart
is gonna tell on you...
i remember sayin i don't care either way
just as long as he or she is healthy i'm ok
then the doctor pointed to the corner of the screen
and said you see that thing right there well you know what that means
and i started wondering who he was going to be
and i thought heaven help us if he's anything like me
he'll probably climb a tree to tall and ride he's bike to fast
end up every summer wearing something in a cast
he's gonna throw a ball and break some glass in a window down the street
he's gonna get in trouble oh he's gonna get in fights
i'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep
it's safe to say that i'm gonna get my pay back if he's anything like me
i can see him right now knees all skinned up
with a magnifying glass trying to melt the tonka truck
won't he be a sight with his football helmet on
that'll be his first love till his first love comes along
he'll get his heart broke by the time hes in his teens
and heaven help him if he's anything like me
he'll probably stay out to late and drive his car to fast
get a speeding ticket he'll pay for mowing grass
he's gonna get caught skipping class and be ground for a week
he's gonna get in trouble he's gonna get in fights
i'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep
it's safe to say that im gonna get my pay back if he's anything like me
he's gonna love me and hate me along the way
years are gonna fly by i already dread the day
he's gonna hug his momma he's gonna shake my hand
he's gonna act like he cant wait to leave
but as he drives out hell cry his eyes out
if he's anything like me there's worse folks to be like
aw he'll be alright if he's anything like me
somebody's missing you
longs to be kissing you
you'd better listen
you mean all the world to me
you're on somebody's mind
just almost all the time
bet you already knew
somebody's missing you
the days go slowly by
when i'm away from you
i long to see your smile
and feel the warmth of you
i've loved you for so long
but still we feel brand new
"at home, inside your arms"
somebody's missing you
somebody's missing you
longs to be kissing you
you'd better listen
you mean all the world to me
you're on somebody's mind
just almost all the time
i hope you miss me too
somebody's missing you
last thought before i sleep
first thought when i awake
you're even in my dreams
and i can hardly wait
to hear your voice again
saying all the things you do
in case you're wondering
somebody's missing you
somebody's missing you
longs to be kissing you
you'd better listen
you mean all the world to me
you're on somebody's mind
just almost all the time
i know you know i do
somebody's missing you
in case you're wondering
somebody's missing you
"really, really, really, really missing you"
i had no reason for shopping this season
but i hung your stocking today
it makes me feel better
though we’re not together
you’ll always be in my heart
"merry christmas, wherever you are"
since it was christmas
i thought you might call
or have you stopped thinkin’ about me at all
it’d be a perfect white christmas
a storybook picture
if i could just share it with you
though you’re not here with me
i’ve got your memories
they keep me goin’ sweetheart
merry christmas wherever you are
though you’re not here with me
i’ve got your memories
you’ll always be in my heart
merry christmas wherever you are
merry christmas wherever you are
well it sure feels good to come in here and just pull up a seat
a frosty mug of a cool one helps to beat the heat
these old dog days of summer lord i'll be glad when they're gone
it's too hot to fish too hot for golf and too cold at home
well that baseball game on tv takes me back to when i was a kid
we proudly wore those uniforms just like the dodgers did
yeah we won a few and lost a few and for me it still goes on
it's too hot to fish too hot for golf and too cold at home
well i only planned on one or two i might stay for three
if that good looking thing in the corner keeps smiling back at me
it's so easy not to care bout what's right or what's wrong
it's too hot to fish too hot for golf and too cold at home

he takes me to the places you and i used to go
he tells me over and over that he loves me so
he gives me love that i never got from you
"he loves me too, his love is true"
why can't he be you
he never fails to call and tell me i'm on his mind
and i'm lucky to have such a guy; i hear it all the time
and he does all the things that you would never do
"he loves me, too, his love is true"
why can't he be you
he's not the one who dominates my mind and soul
"and i should love him so, 'cause he loves me, i know"
but his kisses leave me cold
"he sends me flowers, calls on the hour, just to prove his love"
"and my friends say when he's around, i'm all he speaks of"
and he does all the things that you would never do
"he loves me too, his love is true"
why can't he be you

"sit down and talk to me, baby"
everything else can wait
something's gotta change here
before it's too late
we've been living here together
but we've grown so far apart
"where's the fire, where's the passion"
that burns in our heart.
i've been lonely too long
"i've always believe, that leaving was wrong"
"but i'm too weary, to keep holding on"
i've been lonely too long.
god knows i still love you
deep down in my soul
but these years of silent treatment
have taken their toll
"no, i just can't keep on giving"
you've got to meet me halfway
"if you don't love me, if you don't need me"
there's no reason to stay.
i've been lonely too long
"i've always believe, that leaving was wrong"
"now i'm too weary, to keep holding on"

"new york city, 55th and 3rd"
"i reached out my hand, and there you were"
led me where i thought i wouldn't go
"it's more than just my hand now that, you hold."
"there've been lessons learned, pages turned"
love's become a frightening thing to do
"i've been out, and i've been in"
i've been scared to try again
you're worth every hurt my heart's been through
"i'd go through it all again, if i had to"
to get to you (55th and 3rd)
i still see us dancin' in my mind
my arms stay around you all the time
even when we're miles and miles apart
i reach out my hand and there you are
"at the corner booth, i hung on every word"
"you're back beneath my hands, as close as we could be"
"you pull me close, and dance the heart right out of me"
"oh, i hung on every word"
55th and 3rd
55th and 3rd
here i stand hand in hand turning my face to the wall
if she's gone i can't go on with no love at all
everywhere people stare each and every day
i can see them laugh at me i can hear them say
you've got to hide your love away you've got to hide your love away
[ guitar ]
how can i even try i can never win hearin' them seein' them in the state i'm in
how could she say to me love will find a way
gather round all you clowns let me hear you say
you've got to hide your love away you've got to hide your love away
if you had not have fallen
then i would not have found you
angel flying too close to the ground
and i patched up your broken wing
and hung around a while
tried to keep your spirits up
and your fever down
i knew someday that you would fly away
for love's the greatest healer to be found
so leave me if you need to
i will still remember
angel flying too close to the ground
"fly on, fly on past the speed of sound"
i'd rather see you up
than see you down
leave me if you need to
i will still remember
angel flying too close to the ground
[florida georgia line:]
every time i look in your eyes
it's like you take me back to the islands
you got me mile high cause you're my little pilot
"i'm smiling, no sand in the hour glass"
"we can let the hours pass, baby, cause you're timeless"
it's easy living right beside you
"we got it, whatever we go through, baby"
"life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it"
"let love keep us lifting, my dear"
"turn up a summer tune, we're gonna kick it"

not missing a moment we're giving
"cause life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it"
"let love keep us lifting, my dear"
"see, it's a monday through friday, 365 celebration"
a every day-cation
let my kiss be an open invitation
see where it can take us and get our hearts racing
i love flying way up there with you
"you keep the air up in my parachute, baby"
"life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it"
"let love keep us lifting, my dear"
"turn up a summer tune, let's have a party"

when you've strayed from the fold
and there's trouble in your soul
can't you hear the blessed saviour callin' you?
when your soul is lost in sin
and you're at your journey's end
can't you hear the blessed saviour callin' you?
you may not know me now
but i have been around
you'll never see my name on any pages
i'm just the common man
the fool who understands
the pain you go through
when life takes you under
"so, sing for the common man"
a song for the common man
he paid for the song with the sweat of his brow
"he will survive, he will survive"
you may not know my mother
my sisters or my brothers
yet everyone has given for the other
you know the working man
he builds what others plan
"so, everyone of us should sing his story"
"so, sing for the common man"
a song for the common man
he paid for the song with the sweat of his brow
"he will survive, he will survive"
dat after day
he keeps working away
"in offices, factories, and farms"
year after year
he sheds tear after tear
"he will provide, he will survive"
"so, sing for the common man"
a song for the common man
he paid for the song with the sweat of his brow
"he will survive, he will survive"
he will call you baby
but will he listen when you cry?
he will call you sweetheart
but always seem apart.
"he will tear all your fences down,"
trample all into the ground.
he will call you baby.
she will call you honey
and leave you twisting in the wind.
"she will call you darling,"
keep you stunned and wondering.
she will take you to another world
where the winds of confusion swirl.
she will call you honey.
we should call them lucky
as they watch their babies dance.
or maybe call them crazy
for even thinking they have a chance.
they will carry her as far as they can
"then abandon her once again,"
they will call her baby.
they will call her baby
i never worn a halo
don't suppose i ever will
as far as saving me goes
it's a battle up a hill
"but i keep climbin', tryin', fightin'"
got a king james in the dresser
and i take it out sometimes
"but lord knows, i ain't measured"
up to what's inside
"and they say, ""but that's okay"""
but i keep praying for the day
that i can open up that good book
and heaven don't look
like it's out of reach
when it feels like those apostles
are giving me the gospel
and not the third degree
i just wanted to read
and not the biblе versus me
i woke up in last night's clothеs
and it's whisky on my lips
"if god's looking down, i know"
he's really looking down on this
but i have faith that i can change
i keep praying for the day
that i can open up that good book
and heaven don't look
like it's out of reach
when it feels like those apostles
are giving me the gospel
and not the third degree
i just wanted to read
and not the bible versus me
i'm just tryin' to give myself a little grace
'til those words and me get on the same page
and i can open up that good book
and heaven don't look
like it's out of reach
when it feels like those apostles
are giving me the gospel
and not the third degree
i just wanted to read
and not the bible versus me
there you were
sitten on the patio.
watchin the moon and the stars.
here i was watching them twinkle in your eyes.
i never saw anything
so beautiful as you
chourse:
when i look into your eyes
they were all so beautiful
here we are talkin about forever
then as soon you walked out that door. my heart was broken in two.
just hurts as hell i told you before that i tried.
then i saw you in the movies
i didn't even tell you before that....i loved you and i still do
oh i still do forever and ever
till the last day of my life
chourse2x
i always will till the last day of my life
i used to spend my nights out in a barroom
liquor was the only love i'd known
"but you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom, baby"
and you brought me back from being too far gone.
and you're as smooth as tennessee whiskey
you're as sweet as strawberry wine
you're as warm as a glass of brandy
and i stay stoned on your love all the time
"oh, i looked for love in all the same old places"
found the bottom of the bottle always dry
so when you poured out your heart i didn't waste it
'cause there's nothing like your love to get me high
"baby, you're as smooth as tennessee whiskey"
you're as sweet as strawberry wine
you're as warm as a glass of brandy
and i stay stoned on your love all the time
"honey, you're as smooth as tennessee whiskey"
you're as sweet as strawberry wine
you're as warm as a glass of brandy
and i stay stoned on your love all the time
true in this modern world when two lovers get together
chances of'em ever makin' it to forever
couldn't be better than two in a million hearts
girl this ain't just another run of the mill emotion
what i'm feelin' is the definition of devotion
my love for you is true
"true , like the sun comin' up each mornin'"
bright as the light in a baby's smile
sure as a mountain river windin'
right as the rain fallin' from the sky
"girl my love for you, is true"
"true, not another minute on this earth can be borrowed"
so there's no way to know when i'll live my last tomorrow
"but everyday i get, i'll share with you"
this feelin' just keeps gettin' stronger as the time goes by
"it's written on my face, you can see it in my eyes"
my love for you is true
"true , like the sun comin' up each mornin'"
bright as the light in a baby's smile
sure as a mountain river windin'
right as the rain fallin' from the sky
"girl my love for you, is true"
"true , like the sun comin' up each mornin'"
bright as the light in a baby's smile
sure as a mountain river windin'
right as the rain fallin' from the sky
"girl my love for you, is true"
as i waltz in the arms of somebody new
could it be what i feel may be too much too soon
"but the way that you touch me, i want to give in"
it's not so easy holding you when
you're dancing this dance all wrong
new steps don't come easy when old memories hang on
i'm finding i'm falling as the music plays on
keep dancing this dance all wrong
a new partner's touch to an old partner's song
i'm getting the feeling as we dance along
two strangers tonight won't be strangers for long
keep dancing this dance all wrong
you're dancing this dance all wrong
new steps don't come easy when old memories hang on
i'm finding i'm falling as the music plays on
keep dancing this dance all wrong
you're dancing this dance all wrong
new steps don't come easy when old memories hang on
i'm finding i'm falling as the music plays on
keep dancing this dance all wrong
i'm just blue enough to do most anything
and i know i'm gonna hate myself again
but i know you don't want me like i want you
or you'd be afraid to let me get this blue
you could call me up and tell me that you're blue
i could make believe you're not the someone new
you could give my heart the will to fight this thing
i'm just blue enough to do most anything
you could call me up...
words and music by jim hurt and tim dubois
i once thopught of love as a prison a place i didn't want to be.
so long ago i made a decision to be footloose and fancy free.
but you cam i was so tempted to gamble on love just one time.
i never thought i would get caught.
it seemed liek the perfect crime.
"baby, you left me defneseless."
i've only got one plea.
lock me away inside of your love and throw away the key.
i'm guilty of love in the first degree.
"i thought it would be so simple, like a thousand times before."
"i'd take what i wanted and just walk away, but i never made it to the door."
"now babe, i'm not beggin' for mercy."
go ahead and throw the book at me.
"if lovin' you's a crime, i know that i'm as guilty as a man can be."
oh yeah. oh yeah.
oh yeah. love in the first degree.
love in the first degree.
love in the first degree.
i saw the sun begin to dim
and felt that winter wind blow cold
a man learns who is there for him
when the glitter fades and the walls won't hold
"'cause from then, rubble"
what remains can only be what's true
"if all was lost, it's more i've gained"
'cause it led me back to you
"and from now on, these eyes will not be blinded by the lights"
"from now on, what's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight, tonight"
and let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart
"from now on, from now on"
i drank champagne with kings and queens
the politicians praised my name
but those are someone else's dreams
the pitfalls of the man i became
"for years and years, i chased their cheers"
at the crazy speed of always needing more
but when i stop and see you here
i remember who all this was for
"and from now on, these eyes will not be blinded by the lights"
"and rom now on, what's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight"
it starts tonight
and let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart
"from now on, from now on, from now on"
and we will come back home
"and we will come back home, home again"
and we will come back home
"and we will come back home, home again"
and we will come back home
"and we will come back home, home again"
"from now on, these eyes will not be blinded by the lights"
"and from now on, what's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight"
it starts tonight
and let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart
"from now on, from now on, from now on"
and we will come back home
"and we will come back home, home again"
and we will come back home
"and we will come back home, home again"
"from now on, from now on, home again"

i've got this friend who is lonely
she's afraid she'll never find her one and only
a little shy but she can be fun
if the right guy came along
would you know someone
i've got this friend and it sounds crazy
but he's been feeling that way too a whole lot lately
"and interested, oh i'm sure he'd be"
i can almost speak for him
he's that close to me
maybe in each other
they might find the lover
they've been missin' until now
they'd trust the judgment of
two friends like us who care so much
can we get them togetherâ€¦somehow
i've got this friend
"yeah, i think i know her"
my arms can almost feel the way he'd hold her
itâ€™s like he's here when you describe him
and if he's anything like you i'm sure she'd like him
maybe in each other
they might find the lover
they've been missin' until now
they'd trust the judgment of
two friends like us who care so much
can we get them togetherâ€¦somehow

their shadows danced closer on the honky tonk walls
and they'll start to peril 'neath the parking lot moon
and some cars and a pickup won't be picked up 'til noon
somewhere between midnight and daylight
it's an after hours merry-go-round
somewhere between midnight and daylight
there's a whole lot of love lost and found
i wish i could say now that i've learned it all
>from my observations as a fly on the wall
"but if lonesome's a crime oh, i'm guilty as sin"

my older brother tommy was a lineman rest his soul
his job was hanging hot wires on them high-line power poles
every morning bright and early he’d climb way up in the sky
and i never understood it so one day i asked him why
he said it pays big money and man i’m into that
it pays big money if you’re willing to take a chance
"let me tell you something sonny, you ought to see my bank account"
it pays big money but he sure can’t spend it now
"well, my late uncle charlie was this demolition hound"
he’d travel across the country blowing buildings to the ground
he carried a case of dynamite seemed everywhere he went
he smoked them big long cigars and he’d wink at you and grin
"well now the moral of this story boys, is don’t go getting yourself killed"
be kind to your rich relatives they just might put you in their will
that pays big money and we’re all into that
it pays big money and big money’s where it’s at
"let me tell you something sonny, you ought to see my bank account"
it pays big money and we’re rolling in it now
it pays big money having foolish kin
it pays big money guess i owe it all to them
"let me show you something sonny, take a look at this bank account"
it pays big money; let’s all spend some of it now
they're building him up
you see his face on tv
he's turning up
in every magazine
got his sights set on you
he's a man of renown
but you're nobody's fool
cause you've been around
now he's everybody's hero
the talk of the town
everybody's hero let you down
just another hero on the ground
you knew him when
he was nothing at all
you remember a friend
who never thought he could fall
and the world looked so dim
when you opened your eyes
you watched his will to win
cut him down to size
now he's everybody's...
too late to worry
when you're standing tall
too soon to cry
when you lose it all
i wrote to my girl last night
i wrote to my girl last night
i wrote to my girl that i was comin' home
but my last old dollar is done gone
oh my last old dollar is done gone
oh my last old dollar is done gone
now how can a poor boy get back home
when his last old dollar is done gone
i've drank and i've rambled around
i've drank and i've rambled around
now the time has come when i wanna go home
but my last old dollar is done gone
now the east bound train is done run
now the east bound train is done run
now that train is done run and left me all alone
'cause my last old dollar is done gone
i've been called the world's worst loser
and i don't tell a moment that it's true
but i can't stop pretending i won't miss you
i'm the world's worst loser when i'm losing you
i may even cry when it's over or make fun of your somebody new
i'll hold on as long as i can because
i'm the world's worst loser when i'm losing you
i may even cry when it's over...
yes i'm the world's worst loser when i'm losing you
"we were young, barely outta school"
fell in love like lovers do
and the whole world seemed brand new
had a little girl and a little boy
how we shared in our pride and joy
and each day another dream came true
somehow it all just slipped away
oh how a memory fades
sunny skies turned to grey
tomorrow became yesterday
you had a smile that i recall
i see you laughin' there in the hall
with that look twinklin' in your eyes
we used to talk for hours on end
dreamed of forever remember when
the only thing i didn't love was saying goodbye
now we stand here on the fray
not really knowin' just what to say
should i go or should i stay
tomorrow became yesterday [x3]
"we were young, barely outta school"
fell in love like lovers do
and the whole world seemed brand new
never dreamed how things would change
how our lives have rearranged
i'd look around and you'd be gone
somehow you just moved on
now it's time to turn the page
walk away to another stage
i pray to god this memory never fades
tomorrow became yesterday [x2]
we were young barely outta school
fell in love like lovers do
and the whole world seemed brand new
last night i dreamed an angel came he took my hand he called my name
he bade me look the other way i saw a man i heard him say
he said if i'd be lifted up i'll draw all men to me
he turned and then i saw the nail scared hands that bled for me
(i touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there)
my life my heart i gave my soul was in his care
when i awoke my heart beat sore and in the dark i saw a glow
it was no dream he turned my way again i heard my saviour say
he said if i'd be lifted up...
i could get used to this lovin' thing
"the way you call my name, in love's embrace"
i could get used to you everyday
"and your tender ways, i kinda like this lovin' thing"
i've had romance a time or two
"infatuation, then i found you"
i've had 'em steal my heart and run
and that ain't fun for anyone
i could get used to this lovin' thing
"the way you call my name, in love's embrace"
i could get used to you everyday
"and your tender ways, i kinda like this lovin' thing"
i like the way you make me feel
"and what i feel, feels like it's real"
i never once said i love you
until i felt the one that's true
i could get used to this lovin' thing
"the way you call my name, in love's embrace"
i could get used to you everyday
"and your tender ways, i kinda like this lovin' thing"
"yeah, i could get used to this lovin' thing"
"the way you call my name, in love's embrace"
i could get used to you everyday
"and your tender ways, i kinda like this lovin' thing"
i could get used to you everyday
"and those tender ways, i kinda like this lovin' thing"

i have lived in a junkyard
where the weeds eat up the rain
if you get anything there out of place
you know there's hell to pay
"and he said, ""you're as sick as you are lovely"
"and in need of a hand. """
"he tells me, ""you are never worthy, """
"but i was just a child, you see?"
that was my reality
he had a sick little girl
"dirty and hard, with a breast plate made of metal"
she drives all day in her rusty buick
and her feet don't reach the pedals
"got a jar of flies, father's disguise"
where his heart should be
her mouth is sewn together
she screams with those eyes
"""she is sick, she is lovely"
"and in need of my hand. "" (yeah he uses his hands)"
"he tells her, ""you are never worthy. """
"she was all alone, you see?"
that was her reality
i should have been sleeping
should have been dreaming
but i wake up to broken glass
there'll be one more empty desk in my homeroom class
i got an old bone pocket knife tight in my right hand
to save my poor mother from the junkyard man!
he's as sick as she is lovely
and in need of a hand
he will know he's not worthy
"when he dies alone, you see?"
that''s his reality
"i'm not sick, i am lovely"
hatred is the curse of man
i will not feel unworthy
"because i have washed my hands, you see?"
that's my reality
"i've held it all inward, god knows, i've tried,"
"but it's an awful awakening in a country boy's life,"
to look in the mirror in total surprise.
at the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes.
"amanda, light of my life."
fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
"amanda, light of my life."
fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
"it's a measure of people who don't understand,"
the pleasures of life in a hillbilly band.
"i got my first guitar when i was fourteen,"
"well i finally made forty, still wearing jeans."
"amanda, light of my life."
fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
"amanda, light of my life."
fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
sun come up it was blue and gold
sun come up it was blue and gold
sun come up it was blue and gold
ever since i put your picture
in a frame.
i come calling in my sunday best
i come calling in my sunday best
i come calling in my sunday best
every since i put your picture
in a frame
i'm gonna love you
till the wheels come off
oh yea
i love you baby and i always will
i love you baby and i always will
i love you baby and i always will
ever since i put your picture
in a frame
i swear it feel just like
the clocks slow down for a while
and the air tastes sweeter
and breathing gets deeper
as the clouds dance around the sunshine
i hear the church bells ring
"blowing in with the breeze, yeah"
as i stare in your eyes
thanking god for this life that he's given me
you're a gift to me
if i had the chance to make one wish
every single moment would be like this
"laying here baby, just me and you"
"yeah, and every day would be sunday afternoon"
just the touch of your hand
it fixes everything
it gets my heartbeat moving
like it's singing hallelujah
you're the only place i wanna be
right where i wanna be
if i had the chance to make one wish
every single moment would be like this
"laying here baby, just me and you"
"yeah, and every day would be sunday afternoon"
if i had the chance to make one wish
every single moment would be like this
"laying here baby, just me and you"
"that's exactly what i'd do, yeah that's what i'd do"
if i had the chance to make one wish
every single moment would be like this
"laying here baby, just me and you"
"yeah, and every day would be sunday"
every day would be sunday afternoon
"oh, just the touch of your hand"
sunday afternoon
"everything... sunday, sunday afternoon"
i swore the last time that you let me down that i wouldn't see you if you came around
i can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
and i've been so lonely since you've been gone
you've got me under your spell again saying those things again
making me believe that you're just mine
dreaming those dreams again scheming those schemes again
i've gotta take you back just one more time
[ steel ]
everybody tells me that i'm a fool that i never should have put my faith in you
way down deep inside i guess i know it's true
no one else can make me feel the way you do
you've got me under your spell again...
i've gotta take you back just one more time
i've gotta take you back just one more time
i've gotta take you back just one more time
who do i know in dallas
who can i call on the phone
who do i know in dallas
who'll make me forget she's gone
i can's spend the night without someone
the loneliness will drive me insane
who do i know in dallas
who'll make me glad i came
it was shirley consoled me in phoenix
and jeannie in old san antone
but who do i know in dallas
who'll help me forget she's gone
oh who do i know in dallas
who can i call on the phone
who do i know in dallas
who'll make me forget she's gone
we'll build the world of our own that no one else can share
all our sorrows will leave far behind the stairs
and i know you will find there'll be peace of mind
and we'll live in a world of our own
close the door light the lights we'll stay at home tonight
far away from the bustle and the bright city lights
let the world fade away just leave us alone
and we'll live in a world of our own
we'll build the world of our own...
oh my love oh my love i've cried for you so much
lonely nights without sleeping while i long for your touch
now your lips can erase the heartache we've known
come with me to the world of our own
we'll build the world of our own...
and i know you will find there'll be peace of mind
and we'll live in a world of our own
"gimme some straight talk, straight talk -- and hold the sugar please"
"straight talk, straight talk -- sounds plenty sweet to me"
don't talk to me in circles in some mumbo-jumbo jive
"gimme just straight talk, straight talk and we're gonna be alright"
"'cause i like to know just where i stand, i don't like guessing games"
"and i hate a bunch of gibberish, so just spit it out real plain"
don't use big educated words from your bs degree
"straight talk, straight talk -- don't try b.s.-ing me"
"straight talk, straight talk -- turn loose and let it go"
you can tell me anything -- just like on oprah's show
"just tell me how you really feel, be on the up and up"
with questions i can understand -- for answers you can trust
"pick up the 'phone, you're not alone -- we've all got something to say"
so listen in and listen up -- we'll find a better way
"with honesty and common sense, it's really hard to miss"
"straight talk, straight talk -- just tellin' it like it is"
"straight talk, straight talk -- there's nothing like the truth"
just tell me all your troubles -- pretend i'm donahue
"so don't be shy, 'cause we can talk -- you know you've got a friend"
"call me, call me -- for simple straight talkin'"
"what's cookin', america?"
"straight talk, straight talk"
"straight talk, straight talk"
"so some on let's talk turkey, just straight and to the point"
"about passions, about problems, about noses out of joint"
now i want you all to know i care and i do understand
"and hey, thanks for lending me and ear out there in radioland"
"give me some straight talk, straight talk -- don't sugar coat it please"
"straight talk, straight talk -- sounds sweet enough to me"
"but don't talk to me in circles, in your mumbo-jumbo jive"
"straight talk, straight talk -- and we're gonna be alright"
"straight talk, straight talk -- makes plenty sense to me"
"don't talk to me in circles, in your mumbo-jumbo jive"
"gimme just straight talk, straight talk -- and we're gonna be alright"
"gimme just straight talk, straight talk -- and we're gonna be alright"
the older i get
the more i think
"you only get a minute, better live while you're in it"
'cause it's gone in a blink
and the older i get
the truer it is
"it's the people you love, not the money and stuff"
that makes you rich
and if they found a fountain of youth
i wouldn't drink a drop and that's the truth
funny how it feels i'm just getting to my best years yet
the older i get
the fewer friends i have
but you don't need a lot when the ones that you got
have always got your back
and the older i get
the better i am
at knowing when to give
and when to just not give a damn
and if they found a fountain of youth
i wouldn't drink a drop and that's the truth
funny how it feels i'm just getting to my best years yet
the older i get
and i don't mind all the lines
from all the times i've laughed and cried
souvenirs and little signs of the life i've lived
the older i get
the longer i pray
"i don't know why, i guess that i"
got more to say
and the older i get
the more thankful i feel
"for the life i've had, and all the life i'm living still"
the hills were alive with wildflowers
"and i was as wild, even wilder than they"
"for at least i could run, they just died in the sun"
and i refused to just wither in place
"just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow"
so i ran fearing not where i'd go
"when a flower grows wild, it can always survive"
wildflowers don't care where they grow
and the flowers i knew in the fields where i grew
were content to be lost in the crowd
"they were common and close, i had no room for growth"
i wanted so much to branch out
i uprooted myself from home ground and left
took my dreams and i took to the road
"when a flower grows wild, it can always survive"
wildflowers don't care where they grow
i grew up fast and wild and i never felt right
in a garden so different from me
"i just never belonged, i just longed to be gone"
"so the garden, one day, set me free"
hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
i just let him decide where we'd go
"when a flower grows wild, it can always survive"
wildflowers don't care where they grow
"i wandered so aimless, life filled with sin"
i wouldn't let my dear saviour in
then jesus came like a stranger in the night
"praise the lord, i saw the light"
"i saw the light, i saw the light"
"no more darkness, no more night"
"now i'm so happy, no sorrow in sight"
"praise the lord, i saw the light"
"just like the blind man, i wandered along"
"worries and fears, i claimed for my own"
"then like the blind man, that god gave back his sight"
"praise the lord, i saw the light"
"i saw the light, i saw the light"
"no more darkness, no more night"
"now i'm so happy, no sorrow in sight"
"praise the lord, i saw the light"
i was a fool to wander and stray
for straight is the gate and narrow the way
"now i have traded, the wrong for the right"
"praise the lord, i saw the light"
"i saw the light, i saw the light"
"no more darkness, no more night"
"now i'm so happy, no sorrow in sight"
"praise the lord, i saw the light"
i can tell that somewhere there's someone you loved more than me
someone you loved more than me
and it hurts to say it but you have the right to be free
i know that's the way it should be
but i'm too far gone too far gone
i've loved you so much for so long i'm too far gone
if ever your new love should hurt you or make you feel blue
hurt you or make you feel blue
remember your old love will still be around loving you i'll be around loving you
cause i'm too far gone...
in this awful world of sorrow
on this wicked path of sin
never thinking of tomorrow
or what i'd lose in the end
oh i can hear (oh i can hear) the joy bells ringing
where my friends (where my friends) and loved ones wait
oh i can hear the angels singing (sweet singing)
just inside (just inside) those pearly gates
i can hear my savior calling
saying come unto me
wash away your sins forever
and you shall rest eternally
now i'm safe with my jesus
he will guide me on my way
i will sing his praise forever
we'll meet in heaven some sweet day
i wake up to your kiss
and that smile you sometimes smile
when you barely part your lips
then we both stumble out of bed
then sometimes fall back in all over again
"together we both face each brand new day,"
"sometimes, it makes me stop and say"
where would i be without your love
what would i do without your touch
if i needed someone to hold and
the world turned its cold shoulder on me
where would i be
when i get home dog-tired from work
all you have to do is give me that smirk
and the whole days trouble melts away
and a firey passion stirs itself in me
you pull me back when i'm standing on a brink
oh girl you make me stop and think
where would i be without your love
what would i do without your touch
if i needed someone to hold and
the world turned its cold shoulder on me
where would i be
too many nights of lonely
thats just enough to show me
don't ever leave
where would i be without your love
what would i do without your touch
if i needed someone to hold and
the world turned its cold shoulder on me
where would i be
"we say goodbye, see you around"
we turn our backs then turn back around
"we break up, we make up and we make love"
we can't seem to let go girl so
"i'm comin' over, running every red light"
"to hell with the closure, save it for another time"
try not to think about you but it ain't working
why put out a fire when it's still burning
just when i think moving on's getting closer
i'm comin' over
i'm all alone but you're on my phone
"telling me you miss me, heh, that you're at home"
who knows what we are in the morning
all i know is i want you so
"i'm comin' over, running every red light"
"to hell with the closure, save it for another time"
try not to think about you but it ain't working
why put out a fire when it's still burning
just when i think moving on's getting closer
i'm comin' over
instrumental break
"oh, i'm comin' over"
yet we say that we're done and i know that it's late
but you already know i'm on my way
"i'm comin' over, running every red light"
"to hell with the closure, save it for another time"
try not to think about you but it ain't working
why put out a fire that's burning
"i'm comin' over, running every red light"
"to hell with the closure, save it for another time"
try not to think about you but it ain't working
why put out a fire when it's still burning
just when i think moving on's getting closer
i'm comin' over
i'm no stranger to the love of a lowly vice
i drowned my liver and i gambled with my pride
i've had a bad case of addicted phases
moving from one to another
but you got me changing my ways
i'm breaking all the habits i've made
i could make a habit of you
waking up in my bed
staying up till two
cause you're stuck in my head
it's a symphony you sing to me
when you call out my name
i don't know what else to do
but make a habit of you
habit of you
habit of you
cut out the smokes and i stopped staying up all night
i quit checkin' my phone and i'm savin' my dimes
cause it's a wild thing but you got me jonesin
need another taste of you
i don't think i could quit you now
you're all that i can think about
i could make a habit of you
waking up in my bed
staying up till two
cause you're stuck in my head
it's a symphony you sing to me
when you call out my name
i don't know what else to do
but make a habit of you
habit of you
habit of you
alive
something 'bout the look in your eyes
can never get enough of this
high
maybe i'm an addict but i just gotta have it
i just gotta have you
"oh, it's chemical, it's physical, it's spiritual"
maybe i'm an addict but i just gotta have it
i just gotta have you
i could make a habit of you
waking up in my bed
staying up till two
cause you're stuck in my head
it's a symphony you sing to me
when you call out my name
i don't know what else to do
but make a habit of you
habit of you
habit of you
habit of you
with the moon on my shoulder
and you on my mind
i will lay down
i will lay down
with the moon on my shoulder
and you on my mind
i will miss you more than i ever did
lord ever did
they said that time would take care of it
take care of it
i wish time would take care of me
with the moon on my shoulder
and you on my mind
i will lay down
i will lay down
with the moon on my shoulder
and you on my mind
(bob mcdill)
if i quit my job for the simple life
honey would you stand by me
if i bought a little cabin on a mountainside
honey would you stand by me
would you be my one true friend
stick with me through thick and thin
if the roof was old and the rain came in
honey would you stand by me
if i tried my luck in hollywood
honey would you stand by me
if my break never came like i thought it would
honey would you stand by me
would you be my heart of gold
and never complain when the money was low
if your coat was thin and your shoes were old
honey would you stand by me
and if i joined up with the rodeo
honey would you stand by me
if we traveled around from show to show
honey would you stand by me
would you be a cowboy's dream
and smile right on when times got lean
if you didn't have nothin' but boots and jeans
honey would you stand by me
honey would you stand
honey would you stand by me
honey would you stand
honey would you stand by me
honey would you stand
i once was blind
but now i see
i took him for granted
she took him from me
i once had a love
but now now i have none
"and i'm, i'm as blue as can be"
i treated him a-wrong
"and now i'm, i'm all alone"
i took him for granted
she took him from me
well if i had known then
just what i know now
i would've treated him so differently
"and if i, if i had known"
well then i
i could've shown him more love
than he'll ever see from her
i thought i had his love
in the palm of my hand
"but i, i guess she showed me"
"and now i, i understand"
"just how she, she got my man"
i took him for granted
she took him from me
when you start falling
who's gonna catch ya
i'm willing to betcha
it will be me
who's gonna love ya
like there's no other
search and discover
it will be me
when all the others
have gone and hurt you
who won't desert you
it will be me
weighing the options
so much to think of
but when you think love
it will be me
you may not see it now
love is strange that way
"but someday, someway"
baby somehow
when you've been broken
and dreams don't oblige ya
who's that beside ya
"oh, it will be me"
who'll be your only
true romancer
you know the answer
it will be me
what will it take to
bring you to your senses
and finally convince you
it will be me
he told a good story and all of us kids listened
'bout his life on the border and the way it was then
and we all believed him and when he would finish
we'd ask the old cowboy to tell 'em again
you could almost hear those prairie winds blowin'
his saddle a creakin' 'neath his old faded jeans
you could taste the dry dust from the trail he was ridin'
as he sat there and painted those west texas scenes
and the grown-ups would tell us
"you boys keep your distance, that old man's just tellin' you lies"
but to all of us kids cowboy bill was a hero
just as true as his blue texas skies
he told of a time when he rode with the rangers
down on the pecos and he saved the day
"outnumbered by plenty, they were almost too cover"
with thirty banditos headed their way
he looked back just in time to see a horse stumble
the captain went down and bill pulled up on his rains
and through a flurry of bullets he rescued the captain
"and they rode for a sunset, just the story remains"
well i still remember the day that it happened
we waited and we waited but bill never showed
and the follks at the feed store said they hadn't seen him
so we set out for his place down old grist mill road
and we cried when we found him lying there with his mem'ries
"the old trunk wide open, things scattered about"
he was clutchin' a badge that said texas ranger
"and an old ""yeller"" letter said texas is proud"
now who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes
or the bitter direction of impending good-byes
"i've followed and folded, i'm wilted in place"
at the sight of you standing with streaks down your face
with your heart broke and running from the reason
"you got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me"
"heart broke, who kept me from leaving?"
with my heart broke
now pride is a drag and a bore when you're lonely
sheer madness prevails upon reason to you
"but all is not lost, it's only mistaken"
that's small consolation but i know just how you feel
with your heart broke and running from the reason
"you got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me"
"heart broke , who kept me from leaving?"
with my heart broke
nobody said it was going to be easy
we all have feelings that need a softer touch
but nobody said that it would not be worth it
the human condition continues as such
with your heart broke and running from the reason
"you&otilde;ve got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me"
"heart broke, who kept me from leaving?"
"with my heart broke, you&otilde;ve got me heart broke"
they say the love bug will get you at the age of 23
well i'm not tellin' my age but somethin' got a hold on me
i'm just cravin' some lovin' in the old fashion way
honey linger near and listen to all i had to say
why don't you haul off and love me one more time
why don't you squeeze me until i'm turning blind
if you don't cuddle off and love me like i want you to do
i'm gonna haul off and die over you
[ steel ]
i can feel your warm lips near me hear you breathe so soft and fine
i can feel the matrimony crawlin' up and down my spine
i don't believe this love will hurt you cause it feels so nice and kind
it seems mighty close to heaven when your love is on the line
why don't you haul off...
i'm a gonna haul off and die over you
"the other night dear, as i ley sleepin´"
i dreamed i held you in my arms
"when i awoke dear, iwas mistaken"
so i hung my head and i cryed
ref.:
you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when sky is gray
you never know dear how much i loved you
please don´t take my sunshine away
i always love you and make you happy
if your were only say the same
but if you leave me and love another

ref.:

"you told me once dear, you realy loved"
and no one could come between
but now you´ve leaved me to love another

when i awake my poor heart vains
so when you come back to make me happy

miracles appear in the strangest of places fancy meeting you here
the last time i saw you was just out of houston sit down let me buy you a beer
your presence is welcome with me and my friend here this is a hangout of mine
we come here quite often and listen to music partaking of yesterday's wine
yesterday's wine i'm yesterday's wine aging with time like yesterday's wine
yesterday's wine we're yesterday's wine aging with time like yesterday's wine
you give the appearence of one widely travelled i'll bet you've seen things in your time
so sit down beside me and tell me your story if you think you'll like yesterday's wine
yesterday's wine we're yesterday's wine...
[ ac.guitar ]
yesterday's wine we're yesterday's wine...
i used to like
making love then
getting up
and never having to explain
i've always been free
i never could see me
dragin' no ball and chain
i like running around
and being tied down
never was my cup of tea
but since i've been holding an angel
a little heaven's rubbing off on me
and i'm beginning to like just sittin' and holding hands
looking into her eyes i'm thinking about future plans
and then i get the feeling that the life that i'd been leading ain't all it's cracked
up to be
since i've been holding an angel
a little heaven's rubbing off on me
i used like
to spend the night
sittin' on an old bar stool
drinkin' wine and killing time
with all over those other fools
but since you took my hand
i think i understand
it ain't the way it outta be
since i've been holding an angel
a little heaven's rubbing off on me
and i'm beginning to like just sittin' and holding hands
looking into her eyes i'm thinking about future plans
and then i get the feeling that the life that i'd been leading ain't all it's cracked

"softly and tenderly jesus is calling,"
calling for you and for me.
"see, on the portals, he's waiting and watching;"
watching for you and for me.
"come home, come home,"
ye who are weary come home;
"earnestly, tenderly, jesus is calling;"
"calling, ""o sinner, come home!"""
"o for the wonderful love he has promised,"
promised for you and for me.
though we have sinned he has mercy and pardon;
pardon for you and for me.
you taught me how to love with all my heart
with all my soul i trusted you
and now you say we'll have to live apart
a thing i don't know how to do
you say someday i'll find somebody new
and i'll have not one regret
stay a while if what you say is true
stay and teach me to forget
you taught me how to worship you alone
and now you say that you must go
and people call me on the telephone
just to say i told you so
you say someday i'll find somebody new
and i'll have not one regret
stay a while if what you say is true
stay and teach me to forget
stay and teach me to forget
"""please daddy don't get drunk this christmas"
i don't want to see my momma cry
please daddy don't get drunk this christmas
i don't want my momma cry
just last year when i was only seven
"now i'm almost eight, as you can see"
you came home a quarter past eleven
and fell down underneath
our christmas tree
"""please daddy don't get drunk this christmas"
i don't want to see my momma cry
please daddy don't get drunk this christmas
"""please daddy don't get drunk this christmas"
i don't want to see my momma cry

mama smiled and looked
outside the window
she told me son

"""merry christmas"""
i turned around and saw
my momma's tears
"no,i don't want to see my momma cry"
she said we were way too young
when the drinks were cheap and the fights were fun
it ain't over yet but it's a long time done
he said i'm only 43 and the guy in the mirror doesn't look like me
i know you'd be happy with who i used to be
"but he's gone, gone, gone and i'm moving on, so long"
you gotta roll with the flow till the flow don't roll no more
"you gotta know when to hold, when to fold, when to hit the road"
and when to stay the course
you gotta learn to bend or the diffеrence in a little rain and a raging storm
you gotta roll with thе flow till the flow don't roll no more
then roll on out the door
i've been swimming right upstream
wondering how much brass is left on that ring
and when is last call really your last drink
i thought you go as long as it takes
but how many fools can one drink make
"with so many cracks in a heart, what's one more break"
you gotta roll with the flow till the flow don't roll no more
"you gotta know when to hold, when to fold, when to hit the road"
and when to stay the course
you gotta learn to bend or the difference in a little rain and a raging storm

"well, life's been kind of trippy down here in mississippi"
since cassie o'grady disappeared
and me and my bob shaver been in all the newspapers
every day for nigh on a year
they say we got tangled in a love triangle
a fatal game of truth or dare
but the truth remains a mystery and now it's ancient history
it's a choctaw county affair
it's just a choctaw county affair (choctaw county affair)
"well, people talkin' 'bout it everywhere"
(choctaw county affair)
"well, cassie o'grady was no southern lady"
despite all the media hype
they all loved to make her out like a sweet little devout
all-american cheerleader type
but her mind was cattywampus
"she was greedy, she was pompous"
strutting 'round with her nose in the air
she was a cold gold-digger tickling a hand trigger
it's a choctaw county affair
it's just a choctaw county affair (choctaw county affair)
and now they say she's lying dead somewhere
(choctaw county affair)
"well, i do not deny i wished cassie would die"
when she threatened us with blackmail
she said she had some information
that would wreck my reputation
and land bobby back in jail
now it's best to remember bobby shaver's got a temper
like a buck-shot grizzly bear
"but there's nobody, there's no witness"
so y'all go mind your business
it's a choctaw county affair
it's just a choctaw county affair (choctaw county affair)
"oh, you mess with bobby and you better beware"
"(choctaw county affair) , yeah yeah-yeah"
"hey, yeah"
"well, the press went wild on the day of the trial"
when they put us on the witness stand
they thought we'd turn on each other
but soon they all discovered
"we were live-or-die, hand in hand"
and that fancy d. a. from down jackson way
"said he'd see us in the electric chair, ha"
"but the foreman of the jury told me ""honey, don't you worry"""
"it's a choctaw county affair, yeah"
(choctaw county affair)
"yeah, it's just a choctaw county affair"
"(choctaw county affair) , yeah"
how would you know cause you weren't there
(choctaw county affair)
it's just a choctaw county affair (choctaw county affair)
"mm, yeah, yeah (choctaw county affair)"
this is the first letter that i wrote back home to mom and daddy
a few days after i'd moved to nashville
june 2nd 1964 nashville tennesee
dear mom and daddy i hope this letter finds everybody well and happy
as for me i'm fine i guess i'm just a little lonesome and a whole lot homesick
i got to nashville ok and i thought i'd better write and let you know
cause i knew you'd be worried about me
and i don't let you know to worried about me cause i'm gonna be alright
once i get settled and used to bein' away from home
i didn't realize how much i loved you and all them noisy kids until i left
and i didn't reaize how hard it was to eave home eiter
till i started to leave and everybody started cryin' includin' me
i cried almost all the way to nashville
and i wanted to turn around a few times and come back
but you know how bad i've always wanted to go to nashville
and be a singer and songwriter
and i believe that if i try long enough and hard enough that someday i'll make it
don't worry about tryin' to send me any money or anything
cause i've got a job singin' on the early morning television show
here called the eddie hill show
and a couple of folks already told me that they might record a couple of my songs
so i'll be makin' enough money to get by
and i don't want you to worryin' about me bein' hungry or anything
and nashville's not exactly what i thought it was gonna be
but i believe i'm gonna like it here once i get used to it
and i don't want you to worryin' about me gettin' in trouble either
cause i'll be good just like i promised you i would when i left
well can't think of anything else to say
i guess i'd better close for now and you write me real soon
and tell everybody i said hello and i'm gonna be real anxious to hear from you
cause i sure miss you and i love you an awful lot
with love as always dolly
i'd be the last one to tell you that you shouldn't go
"and the first to say: ""be happy if you can"
"""but you lie and hurt someone"
who needs and loves you so?
do you mind too much if i don't understand?
i suppose that you're convinced
this is the thing to do
life is short and sweet
break all the hearts you can
i guess i shouldn't be surprised: it's
all a game to you. but do you mind too much if i don't
understand? forgive me but it all seems so unreal to me
"and my heart and me, we'd made so many plans"
"but that's all over now, there's nothing left to do"
but do you mind too much if i don't understand?
forgive me but it all seems so unreal to me
"and my heart and me, we'd made so many plans"
"but that's all over now, there's nothing left to do"
but do you mind too much if i don't understand?
do you mind too much if i don't understand?
tonight as i lay on the boxcar
just waiting for a train to pass by
what will become of the hobo
when his time comes to die
there's a master up yonder in heaven
got a place that we might call our home
will we have to work for a living
or can we continue to roam
will there be any freight trains in heaven
any boxcars in which we might hide
will there by any tough cops or brakemen
will they tell us that we cannot ride
will the hobo chum with the rich man
will we always have money to spare
will they have respect for the hobo
in that land that lies up there
(hillary lindsey)
show me your shadows
let down the guard that you hold so high
come all unraveled
give me the pieces you always hide
i will not judge you
i will not run
when you let me see you come undone
uncover your secrets
give me your trust
"oh, my love is strong enough"
for your shadows
"i don't know what haunts you, baby"
the ghosts that you fight with the lone at night
the fears that confront you
i wanna see you from every side
i will not judge you
i will not run
when you let me see you come undone
uncover your secrets
give me your trusts
"oh, my love is strong enough"
for your shadows
let me lie down in your dreams
let me see and touch everything
everything
walk me through your shadows
i will not judge you
i will not run
when you let me see you come undone
uncover your secrets
give me your trust
"oh, my love, my love is strong enough"
they just don't make love like they used to they stone a heart so warm and true
it seems to fall apart no matter what we do
they just don't make love like they used to
love just don't hold on like it used to it dies before it's halfway through
it seems to fall apart no matter what we do
they just don't make love like they used to
i remember when i loved you meant all the world
[ strings ]
it seems to fall apart...
i remember when i loved you meant all the world
oh pioneer
i sing your song
it's the hymn of those who've gone before
and those who carry on
pioneer
your work is hard
but the future of us all rests on the shoulders of your heart
where are we going
oh i don't know
but still i've got to go
what will become of us
oh i don't care
all i know is i'll go anywhere
pioneer
oh pioneer
so young and brave
be careful of the careful souls who doubt you along the way
pioneer
you orphaned child
your mother is adventure and your father is the wild
where are we going
oh i don't know
but still i've got to go
what will become of us
oh i don't care
all i know is i'll go anywhere
pioneer
let your heart not be troubled
i won't run when bullets chase me
i won't rest where arms embrace me
i will love when people hate me
"i won't hush, no you can't make me"
send the dark but it won't break me
you can try but you can't change me
"take my life, they will replace me"
"i won't hush, no you can't make me"
"i won't hush, no we will sing"
where are we going
oh i don't know
but still i've got to go
what will become of us
oh i don't care
all i know is i'll go anywhere
pioneer
let your heart not be troubled
if you offered me a shade of blue
would i return it saying that it was too
dark or light?
or would i see it for the precious thing
that it might one day be?
hold on to me
if you offered me a point of view
would i dismiss it saying that it was too
black and white?
or would i see it as the special thing
that it would no doubt be?
hold on to me
i'll hold on to this gift we share
it is as slippery as it is rare
i'll hold on to that feeling
of waking and finding you there
i'll hold on to you and you hold on to me
if i asked you for a simple thing
would you do it without too much thinking or fuss?
would you see it for the precious thing
that it would surely be?
hold on to me
hold on to me
hold on to me
we don't smoke marijuana in muskogee;
we don't take no trips on lsd
we don't burn no draft cards down on main street;
"we like livin' right, and bein' free."
"i'm proud to be an okie from muskogee,"
a place where even squares can have a ball
"we still wave old glory down at the courthouse,"
and white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all
we don't make a party out of lovin';
we like holdin' hands and pitchin' woo;
"we don't let our hair grow long and shaggy,"
like the hippies out in san francisco do.
"and i'm proud to be an okie from muskogee,"
a place where even squares can have a ball.
"we still wave old glory down at the courthouse,"
and white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all.
leather boots are still in style for manly footwear;
beads and roman sandals won't be seen.
"football's still the roughest thing on campus,"
and the kids here still respect the college dean.
and i'm proud to be an okie from muskogee
a place where even squares can have a ball
"we still wave old glory, down at the courthouse,"
"in muskogee, oklahoma, usa."
they heard the breeze in the trees making weird melodies
and they made that the start of the blues
and from a jail came the wail of a downhearted frail
and they played that as part of the blues
from a whippoorwill out on a hill they took a new note
pushed it through a horn till it was worn into a blue note
and then they nursed it rehearsed it and gave out the news
that the southland gave birth of the blues that the southland gave birth of the blues
we're all lookin' for a message here
a little wisdom on a souvenir
another bottle with an s. o. s
throw it in the water and pray for the best
there ain't a compass or a northern star
that ever really tells us where we are
we're just a shore runnin' out of sand
and reachin' for a hand
every heart is an island
but no one's alone
ship wrecked in a high wind
tryin' to find our way home
and every tear is an ocean
we're all brothers in a storm
and we're tyrin' to survive it
lookin' for dry land
every heart is an island
silverlinin' is kinda hard to find
when the world stops at the horizon line
there ain't a harbor that you'll recognize
it's hard to make a wish in an empty sky
boardwalks are just nails and wood
the pretty and a picture when times are good
cars and boats are just on loan
our house is just sticks and stones
every heart is an island
but no one's alone
ship wrecked in a high wind
tryin' to find our way home
and every tear is an ocean
we're all brothers in a storm
and we're tyrin' to survive it
lookin' for dry land
every heart is an island
every heart is an island
and no one's alone
ship wrecked in a high wind
tryin' to find our way home
and every tear is an ocean
we're all brothers in a storm
and we're tyrin' to survive it
lookin' for dry land
every heart is an island
every heart is an island
ah! it’s just another wasted mornin’
while i’m holdin’ up the wall
too much tequila makes me wonder
why i’m headin’ home at all
get that honky tonk feelin’
every time your arms grow cold
i suppose that’s the reason
i need a home away from home
so i’ll say one more time
and i hope you’ll understand
"if i can’t find it in your arms, babe"
i’m gonna find it where i can
i can’t refuse them lonely women
"lord, i know just how they feel"
i suppose that’s the reason
what you been givin’ me makes me feel
"honey, i’m gettin’ that honky tonk feelin’"
every time your arms grow cold
and i suppose that’s the reason
i need a home away from home
"so i’ll say it one more time, one more time"
and i hope you’ll understand
"if i can’t find it in your arms, babe"
i’m gonna find it where i can
"if i can’t find it in your arms, babe"
i’m gonna find it where i can

you think you're smart
you broke my heart
left me to cry here alone
but you'll return
one day you'll learn
the heart you break may be your own
you promised me
your love would be
a kind i'd never known
tho' you weren't fair
you're unaware
the heart you break may be your own
you used my heart for a plaything
"you'll be sorry, just wait and see"
one day you'll find you are lonely
and the first one you'll think of is me
you'll look around
and when you've found
that you are all alone
then you'll get wise
and realize
the heart you break may be your own

busted flat in baton rouge
headin' for the train
feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
bobby thumbed a diesel down
just before it rained
took us all the way to new orleans
i took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
i was blowin' sad while bobby sang the blues
with them windshield wipers slappin' time
and bobby clappin' hands
we finally sang up every song that driver knew
freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
and nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
"feelin' good was easy, lord, when bobby sang the blues"

good enough for me and bobby mcgee
from the coal mines of kentucky
to the california sun
bobby shared the secrets of my soul
standin' right beside me
through everything i've done
and every night he kept me from the cold
then somewhere near salinas
i let him slip away
lookin' for the home i hope he'll find
and i'll trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
holdin' bobby's body next to mine
freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

"so i held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, i"
kissed her while the guitars played
the bonaparte's retreat
guitar.....
all the world wa-as bright as i held her on that night
and i heard her-er say
please don't you go away
"so i held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, i"
kissed her while the bagpipe played
the bonaparte's retreat
bagpipe....
well i met the girl i-i love in a town way down in dixie
beneath the stars up above
she was the sweetest girl i ever did see
"so i held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, i"
kissed her while the fiddles played
the bonaparte's retreat
fiddle....
all the world wa-as bright as i held her on that night
and i heard her-er say
please don't you go away
"so i held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, i"
kissed her while everybody played
the bonaparte's retreat
everybody....
"yes i held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, i"
kissed her while everybody's playin'
the bonaparte's retreat
"yes i held her in my arms, i told her of her many charms, and i"
kissed her while everybody's playin' (fade)
so much for never makin' the same mistake
i can't believe i'm here again
so much for ever thinkin' that i could change
my good intentions still remain in chains
she's gotta be over me now
probably moved on with her life
found someone she knows she can believe
god i would give anything if i could just go back again
and be the man she needed me to be
i thought i was a hero
i played him well
he saves the day but not himself
i acted out the lover
my finest part
had all the lines but not the heart
no look where we are
"be the man that she could trust, who put her first"
"who tamed his demons, who healed her hurts"
"in health and sickness, who helped her grow"
"with no resentment, true repentance, god as my witness"
she needed me to be
"she needed me to be, oh"
"whoa, hallelujah"
"yeah, i could be that man she needed me, she needed me to be"
you look good in anything you choose to wear
even a trace of gray would look good in your hair
and you look fine in sunshine baby or the shadows of a storm
but you always look your best here in my arms
you look good when you sit and rock our baby
you look great the perfect picture of a lady
and you look fine with your smile so angel soft and sunshine warm
but you always look your best here in my arms
we look good walking together
and we feel so good holding each other
i'm depending on your tender love to keep me safe and warm
yes you always look your best here in my arms
i'm depending on your warm and tender love to keep me strong
and you always look your best here in my arms

ooh
when my strength is not enough to face the disapointments
when nothing seems to work out like i planned
"when i think i've reached the end, just stop and reassure me"
"cause i can make it, if you say i can"
"if you say i can, then i can find the strength to do it"
in knowing you believe that much in me
tell me that i can and give me faith in what i'm doing
i'm only just as strong as you make me
"but i can do it, if you say i can"
when i've reached the point of thinking life's not worth the bother
when i can't seem to give what life demands
when it seems impossible to make it any farther
"i can go on, if you say i can"
"if you say i can, then i can find the strength to do it"
in knowing you believe that much in me
tell me that i can and give me faith in what i'm doing
i'm only just as strong as you make me
"but i can do it, if you say i can"
many's the time i've been mistaken and many times confused
yes and i've often felt forsaken and certainly misused
"oh but i'm alright, i'm alright just weary to my bones"
still you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant
so far away from home so far away from home
don't know a soul who has not been battered
don't have a friend who feels at ease
i don't know a dream that's not been shattered or driven to its knees
oh but it's alright it's alright for we've lived so well so long
still when i think of the road we're traveling on i wonder what's gone wrong
i can't help it i wonder what's gone wrong
and i dreamed i was dying i dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
looking back down at me smiled reassuredly
i dreamed i was flying high up above my eyes could clearly see
the statue of liberty sailing away to sea
and i dreamed i was flying
we come on the ship they call the mayflower come on the ship that sails the moon
we come in the age's most uncertain hours and sing an american tune
oh but it's alright it's alright can't be forever blessed
still tomorrow's gonna be another working day and i'm trying to get some rest
that's all i'm trying to get some rest
by now i bet she's wonderin' how i'm doin
if it broke my heart when she told me goodbye
well every night i sleep just like a baby
i wake up every hour and cry
i'll bet she even thinks i'm gonna miss her
she probably thinks she's always on my mind
but every night i sleep just like a baby
i wake up every hour and cry
she believes that i can't live without her
and it hurts so bad some times i almost die
well every night i sleep just like a baby
i wake up every hour and cry
(spoken)
you know i bet way down deep
that she thinks i'll always love her
and i'll bet she thinks i'll never
love another no matter how hard i try
but every night i sleep just like a baby
i wake up every hour and cry
lord every night i sleep just like a little bitty baby
i wake up every hour and cry
to be alone with you
"oh just, just we two"
"for my, my dream come true"
is to be alone with you.
"but, you, oh you don't know"
"what is on, what's on my mind"
"for i, i tried to tell you"
"for so many, many times."
one day i won't be afraid
i'll tell you i love you so
"and i wonder darling, if you will feel the same"
"yes i can only hope, i'll i'll i'll be alone"
alone with you.
and you're gonna say you love me too
oh my my dreams come true
is just to be alone with you
"oh my, my dream come true"
is to be alone with you...
a paper pack of sugar a plastic spoon and knife
a paper cup a paper plate a different boy each night
i'm getting tired of a paper and a plastic world
one that's not a lasting world that's how i feel
i'm looking for a silver and a crystal world
not an artificial world but one that's real
shiny plastic flowers electronic steeple chimes
seem to be becoming the symbols of our times
i'm looking for a simple sandy suntan world
not a handy sunlamp world but one that is true
(i'm searching for) the kind and honest joy that i'll find in a boy like you
i went downtown thought i had a dime
got home this morning didn't have a dime
lordy lordy lordy got the dog house blues
no use talkin' i got the dog house blues.
come home this morning about half past eight
she said honey you're out too late
lordy lordy lordy got the dog house blues
no use talkin' i got the dog house blues.
i went in the house to start the fire
she kicked me out in the middle of the night
lordy lordy lordy got the dog house blues
no use talkin' i got the dog house blues.
i fell in the yard mad as i can be
said to my dog make room for me
lordy lordy lordy got the dog house blues
no use talkin' i got the dog house blues.
straight-backed chair and a table
where he sits when he's able
to walk over from bedridden misery
to record from his thoughts
on a worn out table cloth
where he'd been while
his mind breaks sleeplessly
though his body's bent with age
"you know, he's still out on that stage"
entertaining all his friends
that pause to greet him at the door
forty-nine years out on the road
many nights he'd saved a soul
now he sits and waits
to claim his own reward
god's own singer of songs is going home
"though he's poor, he might be"
the richest one you know
all his pain will set him free
wash his soul and cleans him clean
god's own singer of songs is going home
god's own singer of songs is going home
hear 'em singing happy birthday
better think about the wish i made
this year gone by ain't been a piece of cake
every day's a revolution
pull it together and it comes undone
just one more candle and a trip around the sun
i'm just hanging on while this old world keeps spinning
and it's good to know it's out of my control
if there's one thing that i've learned from all this living
is that it wouldn't change a thing if i let go
"no, you never see it coming"
always wind up wondering where it went
only time will tell if it was time well spent
it's another revelation
celebrating what i should have done
with these souvenirs of my trip around the sun
"yes, i'll make a resolution"
then i'll never make another one
just enjoy this ride on my trip around the sun
just enjoy this ride ...
until it's done
"there ought to be a town out there,"
named for how i feel.
"yeah i could be the mayor down there,"
and say welcome to sorryville.
"it won't be on a map nowhere,"
"you might say that it doesn't exist,"
but if you make enough wrong turns
it'd be hard to miss.
they could dedicate to me.
i'd probably come to the ceremony
with a can of gasoline;
walk on over to the other side
and there i'd light a match
and sit and stare through the smoke and the flames
wonderin' how i'm ever gonna get back.
why do i do the things i do?
was i born this way? am i a self-made fool?
i shoot the lights and curse the dark;
i need your love but i break your heart;
"and i know the words that'll bring you back,"
but i don't say nothin' as i watch you pack.
i had to work to be the jerk i've come to be;
it ain't easy bein' me.
ought to be a side show act for freaks like me;
yeah i could be the star of the show
with my name on the marquee.
"in a room with a big red button that says \""do not touch,\"""
and twice a day i'd mash it down
and you could watch me self-destruct.
why do i do the things i do?
was i born this way? am i a self-made fool?
i shoot the lights and curse the dark;
i need your love but i break your heart;
"and i know the words that'll bring you back,"
but i don't say nothin' as i watch you pack.
i had to work to be the jerk i've come to be;
it ain't easy bein' me.
of all the roads i've traveled and all the sights i've seen
the most amazing thing is the power of our dreams
and anything is possible for those who can believe
just get your heart to rearrange its priorities
for us to make love work
we've got to try a little harder
and for love to work we gotta hold on
a human heart is just too precious
to spend it feeling hurt
let's start to take the chance to make love work
it takes faith in one another to see things eye to eye
and it's hard to trust but you know it's worth the try
there's a candle in my window and whenever you feel blue
you can bet your bottom dollar i'll be there for you
for us to make love work
we've got to try a little bit harder
and for love to work we gotta hold on
a human heart is just too precious
to spend it feeling hurt
let's start to take the chance to make love work
oh i do believe in miracles
but i know they don't come easy
so why don't we give destiny
a helping hand
for us to make love work
we've got to try a little bit harder
and for love to work we gotta hold on
a human heart is just too precious
to spend it feeling hurt
let's start to take the chance to make love work
life is just too beautiful
to spend it feeling hurt
let's start to take the chance to make love work
did someone say work?
"naw, that's a bad word"
when it's sunny and seventy-five
how does anyone get anything done
when all you wanna do is let it unwind?
"with a cooler, some water"
clear blue skies
"yeah, man, that sounds just right"
so grab a little sunshine
a corona and a lime
and mix it all up together
get a tan while you can
"yeah, forget about your plans"
'cause the summer won't last forever
"so just sip, sip, sip away"
"before it slips, slips, slips away, yeah"
don't need a big boat
just anything that floats
my baby's painted toes over the side
makin' some big waves
hot even in the shade
there ain't a cooler way to have a good time
"than a cooler, some water"
clear blue skies
"yeah, man, that sounds just right"
so grab a little sunshine
a corona and a lime
and mix it all up together
get a tan while you can
"yeah, forget about your plans"
'cause the summer won't last forever
"so just sip, sip, sip away"
"before it slips, slips, slips away, yeah"
go on and tip it back now
go on and just relax now
"sip, sip, sip away"
"sip, sip, sip away, yeah"
so grab a little sunshine (little sunshine)
a corona and a lime
and mix it all up together
get a tan while you can (tan while you can)
"yeah, forget about your plans (oh-oh)"
'cause the summer won't last forever (oh-oh)
"so just sip, sip, sip away"
"before it slips, slips, slips away"
"oh, won't you sip, sip, sip away"
"before it slips, slips, slips away?"
"see, we could mix it all up together"
"yeah, man, that sounds just right"
just keep sippin' away
i still believe
"(jon davis, billy decker)"
pick up the phone
i know you're home
i see your silhouette
from this rainy pay phone booth
i didn't mean what i said
i'm sorry i snapped and lost my head
those angry words were so far from the truth
"baby, i still believe in love"
"baby, i still believe in both of us"
i'd die before i'd ever let you go
until you're in my arms again
i'll fight for you 'til the very end
i still believe
i was wrong and i admit it
"hey, i was out of line"
now i pray my heart
somehow can change your mind
"baby, i still believe in love"
"baby, i still believe in both of us"
i'd die before i'd ever let you go
until you're in my arms again
i'll fight for you 'til the very end
i still believe
"no mas amore, no mas amore aqui"
no love to be found
"no one around now, but me"
last time i saw her
was down by the edge of the sea
"no mas amore, no mas amore aqui"
i would have followed you to anywhere
nowhere i wouldn't have gone
you could have taken me anywhere
you had to go it alone
"no mas amore, no mas amore aqui"
no love to be found
"no one around now, but me"
last time i saw her
was down by the edge of the sea
"no mas amore, no mas amore aqui"
down by the rocks
where the waves play the shore like a drum
sometimes i swear
i can hear her guitar gently strum
i walk the beach
underneath the moons pale blue light
haunted by the song
of a love lost to the changing tide
i would have followed you to anywhere
nowhere i wouldn't have gone
you could have taken me anywhere
you had to go it alone
"no mas amore, no mas amore aqui"
no love to be found
"no one around now, but me"
last time i saw her
was down by the edge of the sea
"no mas amore, no mas amore aqui"
"no mas amore, no mas amore aqui"
today i started loving you again
i'm right back where i've really always been;
"i got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend,"
then today i started loving you again.
what a fool i was to think i could get by
with only these few million tears i've cried.
i should have known the worst was yet to come.
and that crying time for me had just begun.
"'cause today i started loving you again,"
i'm right back where i've really always been;
"i got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend,"
then today i started loving you again.
when i lose my smile
when my thoughts get jumbled
when the air and bs get too thick
can''t take a breath without getting sick
i've had enough with this concrete jungle
i drop my truck in drive
i pick up my baby
she jumps in with a kiss and a hey
we exit off that old highway
sometimes you gotta go beyond the pavement
you gotta go deep
way on back
cross a few creeks
and a couple little shacks
you gotta get lost
way on out
crickets and frogs
yeah you're gettin' close now
and you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road
"and you go, and you go and you go-go-go"
'til you hear a banjo
it ain't on no map
and i'm glad it isn't
"leave the phone and the gps,"
"those satellites ain't found it yet,"
got our own little piece of heaven hidden
"yeah, you gotta go deep"
way on back
cross a few creeks
and a couple little shacks
you gotta get lost
way on out
crickets and frogs
yeah you're gettin' close now
and you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road
"and you go, and you go and you go-go-go"
'til you hear a banjo
you gotta go deep
way on back
cross a few creeks
and a couple little shacks
you gotta get lost
way on out
crickets and frogs
yeah you're gettin' close now
and you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road
"and you go, and you go and you go and you go and you go"
oooh hoo
'til you hear that banjo
kick it
you gotta go deep
way on back
oh oh oh
cross a few creeks
and a couple little shacks
oh oh oh
four wheel drive when you run out of road
oh oh oh
"and you go and you go, and you go"
"'til you hear that, '"
til you hear that
'til you hear that banjo
she was only ten when her daddy got fired
he drank away the family home and left them all alone
and then her mommy was just too tired
so she got sent away
she moved in with her aunt in arizona
everything was fine until she told on uncle bill
when he said he only wanted to hold her
she had to run away
"but when it rains, the past gets washed away, and then"
she smiles 'cause she knows in the end
"the world gets beautiful, beautiful again"
her boyfriend said i'm way too young to get married
but she made up her mind that somehow she was gonna
find a way to keep that baby she carried
and he just walked away
and when she's lying all alone
thinkin' about her life she wonders
if she is wrong to believe in a better world
then she sees her little girl
and she knows she is right 'cause
a big moon is risin'
so bright in the sky
but it won't shine brighter
than the stars in your eyes
it rises above me
so bright and so blue
and i won't see anyone
as lovely as you
take me into the night
pass these lonely dreams
in my heart
i love you
more than i can show you
more than i can know in my heart
so lay down beside me
and hold me tonight
for your love has found me
and it feels so right
these thoughts in my mind
are so scattered and few
but i won't see anyone
as lovely as you
take me into the night
pass these lonely dreams
in my heart
i love you
more than i can show you
more than i can know in my heart
in my heart
"wild rebel rose, the kids used to tease you"
"wild rebel rose, every time they'd see you"
in those black turtle necks in mid july
wearin' too much makeup 'round your eyes
"wild rebel rose, i didn't know you"
"wild rebel rose, so i never told you"
how i'd watch from the house across the street
when those blue lights came around
at least three times a week
it's hard for anyone to understand
why at sixteen you just up and ran
they didn't know you only knew your daddy's love
like the back of his hand
"i heard the shots, saw you hit the door"
i snuck in and grabbed that pistol off the floor
don't you worry they won't find it that's for sure
"wild rebel rose, the kids used to tease you"
"wild rebel rose, every time they'd see you"
in those black turtle necks in mid july
wearin' too much makeup 'round your eyes
"hmm, oh, wild, wild, wild rebel rose"
"they didn't know, ooh, yeah, hmm"
her momma's still got that sequin gown that she wore in '68
she taught her early how to smile that smile and wave from
the parade
it took a whole lot of years and tears
for her momma to finally admit
no matter how many stitches and pins
that old dress was never gonna fit
she was daddy's little girl
momma's little angel
"teacher's pet, pageant queen"
"she said, ""all my life i've been pleasin' everyone but me,"
"waking up in someone else's dream"""
"her daddy used to say, ""you'll make a lovely bride someday"
"he'll ride up on a big white horse and just carry you away"""
it took twenty-five years and some broken vows
before they'd finally see
there's a little more to love and life
than fairy tales and hand me down dreams
she was daddy's little girl
momma's little angel
"teacher's pet, pageant queen"
"she said, ""all my life i've been pleasin' everyone but me,"
"waking up in someone else's dream"""
now she's got twenty-seven candles on her cake
and she means to make her life her own
before there's twenty-eight
she was daddy's little girl
momma's little angel
"teacher's pet, pageant queen"
"she said, ""all my life i've been pleasin' everyone but me,"
"waking up in someone else's dream"""
awww but something sure is missin
somethings just aint the same
now he thinks back on yesterday
all those victory lanes
better wars just to steal the race
and to taste that sweet champagne
you either loved him or you hated him
intimidation was to blame
now days each time they drop that flag
somethings just aint the same
somethings just aint the same
ohhh they miss the man today
so they standin next to cheer
and wish the man was here
somethings just aint the same
na na na na na na na
na na na na na na na
awww he starts up that old chevy truck
and he leaves the parking lot
hes thinks of all he'd done today
and he thanks god for what hes got
his youngest son sittin by his side
dale jr's still a fan
he knows the future's lookin bright
but he wont forget the man
somethings just aint the same
ohhh they miss the man today
so they standin next to cheer
and wish the man was here
somethings just never change
so they standin next to cheer
and toast him with their beer
somethings will never change
nooo no noooo
(softer spoken)
theres a three upon his ball cap
and a three upon his shirt
he remembers how he ran this track
and all those old ones in the dirt
my father's stories fell upon us
filled us with his light
"gospels, fertile minds"
"taking root, taking root"
his pocket change would jingle
sacramental bells
heads tucked low
"sneaking peaks, sneaking peaks"
and the rain comes down
"it's dark, and the browns"
begin to bite
here you will always be
"behind me, and you will not go away"
"there he sleeps, an untamed land"
dark corners yet discovered
his heart yet to be
"trod upon, trod upon"
i can't bare to hear his breathing
simply knowing what's to come
i can't bare to hear your breathing
knowing what's to come
"hello, i am your heart"
and you got me broken one too many times
"oh, hello, this is your heart speaking"
and you got me hurt boy one too many times
going away on a little vacation
i'll be gone quite a while
you won't have you no love making
you'll just have that ten cent smile
"goodbye, this is your heart leaving"
i wish you the best of luck
while i'm healing up
oh hello this is your heart
i just telephoned to see how you're getting by
oh hello this is your heart calling
"well, i've got to run now but i'll drop you a line"
i'm having fun on my little vacation
i may be gone a while
you won't have you no love making
you'll just have that ten cent smile
hello this is your heart
i wish you the best of luck
while i'm healing up
oh goodbye
goodbye
d a
i grew up in wyoming
d
in and around jackson's hole
a
in the shadows of the tetons
where summers are hot
d
and winters unbearably cold
g
but the spring and the fall
d
are always as good as it gets
a
for over 70 years now
d
i'd watch the sun rise and set
a
i've been a cowboy
d
working the round-ups in spring
a
i've lived in the mountains
hunted the grizzly
d
trapping the rivers and streams
g
always the loner
d
i've treasured my freedom the most
a
and though i never married
d
as a young man i might have come close
g
from somewhere back east
she came to the valley
d
with a man who did her no good
g
he was fast with the ladies
a tin horn gambler
d
and a cheat whenever he could
g
she had no friends or family
d
most of the time he was gone
a
he died in a card game
d
and she found herself all alone
g
alone and afraid and left unprotected
d
'cause he was all that she had
g
maybe i should have
but i never told her
d
so she never knew he was bad
g
but i'll always remember
d
standing and watching her cry
a
there was no one to help her
d
but i was determined to try
a
i mended her fences and
fixed up her cabin
d
i had everything looking good
a
i laid by her food
and wood for the winter
d
helping wherever i could
g
the more i was around her
d
the more i wanted to be
a
there was something about her
d
that brought out a good side of me
g
"i went into town,i brought a new outfit"
d
i got me a haircut and shave
g
i'd trek through the snow
for no good reason
d
just to go by her cabin each day
g
i don't know about love
d
but i was quite taken in by it all
a
till her brother came in the spring
d
and he took her back to st. paul
a
i don't go down to jackson
d
ain't nothing there but motels and bars
a
too damn many tourists
no place to hide
d
they'll find you wherever you are
g
they like to call me old timer
d
i am getting older i guess
a
but i don't like the changes
d
'cause i've seen it all at its best
a
when my life is over
d
i don't want to be left in town
a
but up in the mountains
there is a place
d
i've marked off my own piece of ground
g
high in the tetons
d
above and away from it all
a
from the top of old grand
i bet on a clear day - you can see
d
all the way to st. paul
mama let me bring your old harmonica to you
i'll get out my guitar and we'll play a song or two
we'll let the music take us back to when i was a kid
take our minds of everything in the way it always did
"we'll play ""you are my sunshine"""
"we'll do ""amazing grace"""
we'll stop and catch our breath
and let our laughter fill this place
and it's too bad with all the family
dad's not here to play along
we'll get back together and it won't be very long
will the circle be unbroken? you always said it would
and we'll all meet again someday and feel it like we should
when the room is cold up yonder and tawnyoo is no more
we'll be shoutin' and a singin' precious memories to the lord
"and we'll play ""you are my sunshine"""
"and do ""amazing grace"""
and stop and catch our breath
and let our laughter fill this place
"with all the family, dad will be right there to play along"
when we get back together and it won't be very long
when we get back together and it won't be very long
whenever i chance to meet
some old friend who's on the street
they wonder how does a man
get to be this way
i've always got a smiling face
anytime and any place
everytime they ask me why
i just smile and say
you've got to
kiss an angel good morning
and let her know you think about her
when you're gone
kiss an angel good morning
and love her like the devil
when you get back home
well people may try to guess
the secret of happiness
but some of them never learn
it's a simple thing
the secret i'm a-speaking of
"well, it's a woman and a man in love"
and the answer is in this song
that i always sing
you've got to
kiss an angel good morning
and let her know you think about her
when you're gone
kiss an angel good morning
and love her like the devil
when you get back home
kiss an angel good morning
and let her know you think about her
when you're gone
kiss an angel good morning
and love her like the devil
when you get back home
kiss an angel good morning...
you just can't stand to see me happy seems you hurt me all you can
still i go on loving you but i'll never understand
oh the pain of loving you oh the mis'ry i go through
never knowing what to do oh the pain of loving you
to love and hate at the same time the line between the two is fine
but too has bound me heart to soul so strong that i can't let you go
oh the pain of loving you...
oh the pain of loving you
(paul brandt/gene pastilli)
if this isn't love
what else could it be
what's happenin to you
what's happenin to me
if this isn't love
what else is so strong
or feels half as good
or lasts half as long
now i am not an expert
on matters such as this
romance has always left me in the dark
but with each brush of your sweet touch
and every lingering kiss
i think that cupid's finally found his mark
could it be a bug
or maybe the flu
that's goin around
you say that you've got it too
if this isn't love
what else could it be
if this isn't love
then it's alright with me
if this isn't love
is it obvious to you
when you walk into a room
your face is all i see
and my heart races so fast
i never knew a rush to feel like that
every time you're touching me
i never did believe in anything
i couldn't hold between my fingers
but the way you make me feel
it's just so real the way it lingers
i get lost inside your stare
lost when you're not there
when everything i have doesn't mean a thing
if it's without you
"if it's a dream, don't wake me up"
i'll scream if this isn't love
if being lost means never knowing
how it feels without you
i wanna stay lost forever
i wanna stay lost forever with you
"no, this feeling doesn't end"
it's with me everywhere i am
hope it never goes away
it's like defying gravity
losing all control and being free
and i always wanna stay
i never thought that i'd let go
long enough to fall for someone deeply
who had the power to erase my fears
and find me so completely
i get lost inside your stare
lost when you're not there
when everything i have doesn't mean a thing
if it's without you
"if it's a dream, don't wake me up"
i'll scream if this isn't love
if bein' lost means never knowin'
how it feels without you
i wanna stay lost forever
i wanna stay lost forever with you
don't tell me where we're goin'
i don't wanna know
i like the mystery (i like the mystery)
i can't believe we've come this far
so far away from where we started off
you found me when i wasn't looking
you found me
and now i'm lost inside your stare
lost when you're not there
and everything i have doesn't mean a thing
if it's without you
without you
if it's a dream
don't wake me up
i'll scream if this isn't love
if being lost means never knowing
how it feels without you
"yeah, if being lost means never knowing"
how it feels without you
"oh, if being lost means that i'm never"
gonna be without you
i wanna stay lost forever
i wanna stay lost forever with you
"maybe baby, i'll have you"
"maybe baby, you'll be true"
"maybe baby, i'll have you for me"
"it's funny honey, you don't care"
you never listen to my prayers
"maybe baby, you will love me someday"
"well, you are the one that makes glad"
any other woman just makes me sad
"when someday you want me, well,"
"i'll be there, wait and see"
"maybe baby, i'll have you for me"
"tommy's daddy, kept a six pack in the fridge"
"we thought we were old enough,"
to do what daddy's did.
it didn't take us long to go
from drunk to really sick.
"when i walked in my house,"
i stumbled just a bit.
"you play it cool,"
"but it's no use,"
"dad ain't no fool,"
and that's the truth.
"chewing gum won't cover,"
up that smell.
"you can't hide one single thought,"
"if you try, you'll just get caught."
when somebody knows you that well.
"we lost daddy,"
in nineteen ninety-nine.
"i took care of everybody's pain,"
except for mine.
"and then one night,"
my wife took my face in her hands.
"she said, ""i think it's time you cry"
"for your old man."""
"you play it cool,"
but it's no use.
"she ain't no fool,"
and that's the truth.
and my teardrops finally fell.
"you can't hide one single thought,"
"if you try, you'll just get caught."
when somebody knows you that well.
"i could probably do more,"
to help my fellow man.
"but life gets busy,"
and i hope god understands.
"someday, when i get time,"
i'll do more than my share.
"funny how i'm thinkin' this,"
sittin' in my easy chair.
"you play it cool,"
but it's no use.
"god ain't no fool,"
and that's the truth.
and he won't let you fool yourself.
"you can't hide one single thought,"
"if you try, you'll just get caught."
when somebody knows you that well...
when somebody knows you that well.
when we dance together my world's in disguise
it's a fairyland tale that's come true
when you look at me girl with those stars in your eyes
i could waltz across texas with you
waltz across texas with you in my arms
waltz across texas with you
like a storybook ending i'm lost in your charms
and i could waltz across texas with you
[ steel - piano - banjo ]
my heartaches and troubles are just up and gone
the moment you come into view
with your hand in mine dear i could dance on and on
and waltz across texas with you
waltz across texas with you in my arms...
i can bring you back anytime i want to
i remember an angel in your veil of white so fine
you were always very near well i feel that you're still here
it's so real in the diary of my mind
on the first page there we are down by the river
with the flowers blooming in the warm sunshine
speaking love words soft and sweet and as our lips slowly meet
we're together in the diary of my mind
yes i can bring you back anytime i want to
even though you been gone a long long time
oh i just close my eyes and then i realize
you're right there in the diary of my mind
on the next page i can smell the yellow roses
you brought to this world our baby girl so fine
a princess for the queen i was such a happy king
you're both still here in the diary of my mind
yes even comes the page i don't like to remember
the hist'ry shows that kingdoms fall with time
mistrust and deceit then the bottle it brought defeat
that's the last scene that's in the diary of my mind
but i can bring you back anytime i want to
even though you been gone a long long time
i just close my eyes and then i realize
you're right there in the diary of my mind
you're still here in the diary of my mind
are we fools for rushin' in
cause i already dread the end
lonely ain't no place to start
i guess that's just where we are
oh how i remember well
the sunset on september 12
i disappeared to get a drink
you still kept your eyes on me
sometimes loves acts out of spite
and good things happen over night
can't take it slow cause you and i are pushin time
i didn't plan on fallin' fast
i didn't know i could be kissed like that
no i'm tradin' miles for minutes
this bed's too big without you in it
sometimes love acts out of spite
and good things happen over night
can't take it slow cause you and i are pushin' time
you and i are pushin' time
and they say only time can tell
you already know me well
if it has to end in tears
i hope that it's in sixty years
sometimes love acts out of spite
and good things happen over night
can't take it slow cause you and i are pushin' time
can't take it slow cause you and i are pushin' time
how long is the river how deep is the sea
how loong is forever that's how long you love me
my heart is beating fast i found true love at last
i'm so optimistic i know this new love will last
[ strings ]
how high is the mountain how far are the space
how long would i hold you in a lover's embrace
until the end of time a love that's so divine
i'm so optimistic about this new love of mine
"baby, oh, baby"
tell the man at the ticket stand
that you've changed your mind
let me run on out and tell the cab
to keep his meter flying
"'cause if you say goodbye to me, babe"
you're gonna break my mind
"break my mind, break my mind"
"no, i just can't stand to hear them big jet engines whine"
"break my mind, break my mind"
if you leave you're gonna leave a babalin' fool behind
"baby, oh, baby"
let me take your suitcase
off the scales in time
tell the man that you've suddenly developed
a thing about flyin'
"'cause if you say goodbye to me, babe"
you know you're gonna break my mind
honey bring me the paper
and pour me a beer
and turn on the tv
and sweep up over here
you tell me you love me
to put off my blues
but what do you do
when it quits being new
now you be home for supper
and don't slam that door
and you better be a sober man
or i'll give you what for
you tell me you love me
to put off my blues
but what do you do
when it quits being new
we used to not worry about nothing
we used to would laugh and play
but now when we look at each other
we never have nothing to say
except for you know well she says
you could take me to dinner
and you could buy me some clothes
if you make all that money man
make damn sure it shows
you could tell me you love me
to put off my blues
but what do you do
when it quits being new
and he says you could put on some makeup
and you could pile up your hair
and at least try to do something
with what you've got there
you could tell me you love me
to put off my blues
but what do you do
say what do you do
when it
what do you do when it
say what do you do when it
say well
hi there
what's your
my name is
and my wife is at the pt and
i had to
you know we could
i buy you
is that a scotch and so a
what will it be
your place
or a place to
say man
what do you think you
see i'm not that kind of
affair is fair
and right is
right around the corner
just a block or
so you know come morning
you'll have to leave
everything to me
what do you do
say what do you do
and that's the glory of
and that's the story of
what do you do
i went to a funeral
lord it made me happy
seeing all those people
i ain't seen
since the last time
somebody died
everybody talking
they were telling funny stories
saying all those things
they ain't said
since the last time
somebody died
but you take a look around you
don't it seem like something's missing
i said something that weren't missing
lord the last time
somebody died
you took him from the last time
to that hallowed ground
i'm praying take me to the next time lord
so i can hang around
then the people start to looking
and some of them start crying
and all the little children
lord they're scared
because they ain't never seen
a dead man before
you took him from the last time
to that hallowed ground
i'm praying take me to the next time lord
so i can hang around
he's swimming through that jordan
going to the other side
but if it's all the same to you lord
i think i'll stay dry
now it's church on sunday
it's a bar on friday night
it's work on monday
the preacher lord you know he might sing
hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
he's got church on sunday
and he got drunk the night before
and he got his good gal when he got home
the preacher said he wants some more of that
hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
now if you want to get to heaven
let me tell you what to do
you better grease your foot up buddy
with that mutton stew
and when the devil comes after you
with them greasy hands
you just slide on over to the promised land
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
now there was two little imps
and they was black as tar
and they was trying to get to heaven
in an electric car
and that car wheel slipped
on down the hill
instead of going to heaven
they went to jacksonville
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
"thank you, you've been so nice"
all my friends they came
now close the lid down tightly
and quit crying
because when they close them
they all look the same
and grab hold of the handle
it won't be too heavy
and take me to the graveyard
i went to a funeral
and lord it made me happy
seeing all those people
i ain't seen
since the last time
somebody...
i took a short vacation
to the gulf of mexico
everyday i'd see this fellow
with his tackle box and pole
and he'd fish
and he'd fish
all day long
so one day i went out walking
and when i got down to his spot
me and him got to talking
and said have you ever thought
about what you are going to do with your life
i said i'm about to share with you
my secret to success
so you can go make something of yourself
you can sell these fish you're catching
you can buy yourself a boat
hard work and dedication
and the next thing you know
you reinvest your money
you'll be captain of the fleet
you'll be sitting pretty down on easy street
and you can do anything that you wish
"he says, you mean fish?"
his simple words of wisdom
hit me right between the eyes
and it really got me thinking
about the way i live my life
cause i just work
and i work
all day long
so i asked myself a question
that i knew the answer to
is success a second mortgage
on a big house with a pool
or is it a chair
the salt in the air
wetting the line
that advice that i tried to give him
to take him to the top
was really nothing more than just a crock
you can sell these fish you're catching
you can buy yourself a boat
hard work and dedication
and the next thing you know
you reinvest your money
you'll be captain of the fleet
you'll be sitting pretty down on easy street
and you can do anything that you wish
"he says, you mean fish?"
so i went and bought some tackle
and a bucket full of bait
you can find me here most days
with my chair sitting there next to his
we just fish
"yeah, we just fish"
"yeah fish, fish, fish, fish, fish"
high on a mountain in western montana
a silhouette moves 'cross a cinnamon sky
riding alone on a horse he called music
"with a song on his lips, and a tear in his eye"
"he dreams of a time, and a lady that loved him"
and how he would sing her sweet lullabies
but we don't ever ask him
and he never talks about her
guess it is better to just let it slide
"but sang ""ooh"" to the ladies"
"and ooh, he made some sigh"
now he rides away on a horse he called music
with a pain in his heart and a tear in his eye
he rode the music from boston to bozeman
"for not too much money, but way to much ride"
but those were the days when a horse he called music
could jump through the moon and sail across the sky
now all that's left is a time-old worn cowboy
with nothin' more than the sweet by-and-by
"and trailing behind, is a horse with no rider"
a horse he calls memories that she used to ride
"and he sang ""ooh"" to the ladies"
"and ooh, he damn near made some fall right down and die"
now he rides away on a horse he called music
with a pain in his heart and a tear in his eye
high on a mountain in western montana
"two crosses cut, through a cinnamon sky"
marking the place where a horse he called music
lays with a cowboy in the sweet by-and-by...
i got your wedding invitation i'm surprised you thought of me
but i don't believe your wedding is just where i ought to be
for you put your arms around her kissed her lips so tenderly
as she's standing there beside you that's just where i ought to be
like a fool i introduced you i said baby meet my friend
never thought that i could lose you but i lost you then and then
i took the diamond ring you gave me threw it way out in the sea
and i had an awful feeling that's just where i ought to be
da da da de de dee da...
like a fool i introduced you...

it's one lonely set of footprints down a snow-white beach
"yeah, without you, it don't feel like paradise"
"without you, it's just paradise lost on me"

and then you swing them to the left you swing
them to the right
step around the floor kind of nice and light
and then you twist around and twist around
with all your might
shake your loving arms way out in space
and then you do the eagle rock with the style
and grace
swing your foot way round then you bring it
back that's what i call ballin' the jack
[ sax ]
well you put your two knees close up tight...
there's a tangled mess of sheets on the bed
a lack of sleep poundin' in my head
we both regret some of the things we said
but we love the way it ends
sometimes i think
we hurt each other just because of where it'll lead
sometimes i think
we're fighting just to be lovers
and all so needlessly
good as we are at gettin' it on
how come we just can't get along?
"the way we love, it don't seem right"
"the way we fuss, the way we fight"
"i got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight"
we make up without a fight
"they say don't go to bed angry, that's true"
but it's really something when we do
"(madder you make me, the more i want you)"
"girl, i admit"
sometimes i think
it couldn't be any better
(and i couldn't want you more)
and sometimes i think
we don't belong together
confusing love and war
good as we are at gettin' it on
how come we just can't get along?
"the way we love, it don't seem right"
"the way we fuss, the way we fight"
"i got a crazy idea, how 'bout maybe tonight"
we make up without a fight
we ain't givin' up without a fight
we can make up without a fight
"(no, we ain't givin' up, we can make up)"
good as we are at gettin' it on
how 'bout maybe tonight
we make up without a fight

"jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock"
jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
now the jingle hop has begun
"jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock"
jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
dancing and prancing in jingle bell square
in the frosty air
"what a bright time, it's the right time"
to rock the night away
jingle bell time is a swell time
to go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
"giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet"
jingle around the clock
mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
that's the jingle bell rock
dance the night away
"jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock"
jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
dancing and prancing in jingle bell square
in the frosty air
"what a bright time, it's the right time"
to rock the night away
jingle bell time is a swell time
to go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
"giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet"
jingle around the clock
mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
that's the jingle bell
that's the jingle bell
that's the jingle bell rock

i'm breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
don't look at me like you think i've got the blues
'cause i'm walking 'round and around and i'm seeing most of the town
i'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
ah ha so i'm talking to myself
oh no she's not putting me on the shelf
i'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
i'm doggone if i'm gonna cry the blues
my feet are sore but i've got no time to lose
'cause i'm wanting her here with me and i'm needing her company
i'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes

the flies have quit their buzzing
even bear has stopped his barking
they all sense something brewing
up the james and headed this way
bobby sips his morning coffee
says `have you finished with the funnies?
looks like a storm's coming honey
guess we'll have to stay in bed today'
i've heard that into every life
a little of it must fall
"if there's any truth to the saying,"
"lord, let it be a southern rain"
"marie was born in macon, georgia"
she met a west coast lawyer
he plucked that sweet magnolia
and carried her to the hills of west l.a.
she says `i never thought i'd tire of a dollar
but this life has grown so hollow
every night there's lipstick on his collar
and every morning i wash it away'
she heard that into every life
a little of it must fall
so she spends her evenings praying
for a little of that southern rain
cars alive on city streets
of sparkling black water
like waves beneath my window
never break just roll away
"tonight, this rain will be my lullaby"
"these cars, my dreams"
to carry me home to stay
the wipers beat a rhythm
truck spray obscures my vision
but i'm closing in on my destination
two more hours and i'll be at your door
and it will never cease to amaze me
how a little rain can drive folks crazy
when i'd trade all my blue skies gladly
"for your blue eyes, crooked smile"
and a steady downpour
i've heard that into every life
"a little of it must fall,"
but you'll never catch me complaining
about too much of that southern rain
if you're trying to reach heaven
"you talk to jesus, you talk to him every day."
"'cause jesus knows, he knows that you are coming"
and heaven's just a prayer away.
"if you go, if you go to church on sunday"
you get down on your knees and pray
and give your heart and your soul to jesus.
heaven's just a prayer away.
you are just one prayer from heaven
as you travel down life's highway.
"just when you think that you can't make it,"
"well, heaven's just a prayer away."
"of, if you go, if you go to church on sunday"
you get down on your knees and pray
and give your heart and give your soul to jesus.
heaven's just a prayer away.
heaven's just a prayer away.
away.
"long neck bottle, let go of my hand"
hey jukebox don't start playing that song again
"'cause there's a girl at home who loves me,"
you know she won't understand
"long neck bottle, let go of my hand"
hey barroom mirror on the wall
go stare at someone new
don't show the world the fool i am
just keep it to yourself
"long neck bottle, let go of my hand"
hey jukebox don't start playing that song again
"'cause there's a girl at home who loves me,"
you know she won't understand
"long neck bottle, let go of my hand"
"dance floor, seems you're underneath my feet"
everywhere i turn
"i'd waltz right out of those swinging doors,"
but that step i just can't learn
"long neck bottle, let go of my hand"
hey jukebox don't start playing that song again
"'cause there's a girl at home who loves me,"
you know she won't understand
"long neck bottle, let go of my hand"
if she thought there was someone else
our romance would be thru
so barstool we can't let her know
you look like an angel with your head in the clouds
"you woke me up this morning with your fooling around, at a half past 3"
"awww, lately i dont get much sleep (thats all right)"
cause girl it feels so good the way you bring out the bad in me
you call me up at work said baby can you come on home
"im feeling kinda crazy and im all alone, i got nothin on"
tell your boss its an emergency (theres a man in need)
cause girl it feels so good the way you bring out the bad in me
id rather ask forgivness than permission
cause im doing all these things ive never dreamed
you put me in a delicate position
but im right where i want to be
girl it feels so good the way you bring out the bad in me
you're like a shot of whiskey to a man that dont drink
"just one taste of you and baby i cant think straight, im on my knees"
girl i love your dirty needs
"yea, it feels so good the way you bring out the bad in me"
id rather ask forgivness than permission
cause im doing all these things ive never dreamed
you put me in a delicate position
but im right where i want to be
girl it feels so good the way you bring out the bad in me
"yea, it feels so good the way you bring out the bad"
"yea, it feels so good the way you bring out the bad in me"
we've spent a long time side by side
guess i've loved you forever
"sometimes we laughed, sometimes we cried"
still we made it together
i don't know what i'd do without you
girl you make me smile
you know i can't stop thinkin' about you
oh you drive me wild
baby our love is still comin' on strong
you give me strength that i needed so long
i can't explain how i feel in my heart
but the love we got goin' will never fall apart
now here you are still in my arms
after so many years have gone
it seems we both were meant to be
now that all of the tears have gone
and when it's time to settle down
and get ourselves a home
i'll be beside you all the way
never again will you be alone
well i get lonely in a hurry if you left for a minute
i go crazy inside while you were gone
yes i get lonely in a hurry if you left for another
i don't think i could take it very long
there would be so many little teardrops fall i don't think that i could count them all
and i know a heart could never ache like mine if i couldn't love you all the time
cause i get lonely in a hurry...
[ guitar ]
if you ever took your love away from me i'd die
i don't think that i might live in memories
and for sure i know that i would lose my mind
if i couldn't love you all the time
cause i get lonely in a hurry...
i don't think i could take it very long
love is so elusive but it's worth the effort once you find the key
awakening to feel a touch and taste the sweetness won't come easily
so hold it gently in your hand or it might slip away into the night
yes love is so elusive that it won't return once it's out of sight
love is like a soft caress a fevered kiss a flame that burns your mind
a whispered promise telling you that you'll be leaving loneliness behind
a brief look at tomorrow like a dream or perhaps an answered prayer
though love is so elusive there's not doubt about it once it's really there
so just reach out and touch it watch it grow from just a tiny little seed
yes love is so elusive but it's everything in your life you really need
[ steel ]
love is like a little bird that seems to feel the urge to fly away
searching for the arms to hold it tenderly and make it want to stay
love is like the petals from a rose just a fragile work of art
yes love is so elusive but it's most content when nearest to your heart
so just reach out and touch it watch it grow...
yes love is so elusive but it's everything in life you really need
we loaded up my old station wagon
"with a tent, coleman, and sleepin' bags"
"some fishin' poles, a cooler of cokes"
three days before we had to be back
"when you're seven, you're in seventh heaven"
when you're goin' campin' in the wild outdoors
"and as we turned off o that old dirt road,"
he looked at me and swore
"dad, this could be the best day of my life"
i've been dreamin' day and night 'bout the fun we'll have
it's just me and you doin' what i've always wanted to
i'm the luckiest boy alive
this is the best day of my life
"well, his fifteenth birthday rolled around"
classic cars were his thing
when i pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
i thought that boy would go insane
when you're in your teens
your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
we worked nights on end 'til it was new again
"and as he sat behind the wheel, he said"
"dad, this could be the best day of my life"
i've been dreamin' day and night 'bout the fun we'll have
it's just me and you doin' what i've always wanted to
i'm the luckiest boy alive
this is the best day of my life
standin' in a little room
back of the church with our tuxes on
lookin' at him i say
"""i can't believe, son, that you're grown"""
he said
"dad, this could be the best day of my life"
i've been dreamin' day and night 'bout bein' like you
now it's me and her watchin' you and mom i've learned
i'm the luckiest man alive
this is the best day of my life
i'm the luckiest man alive
no we can't control the evil that surround us
but as long as we're together that's enough
if there were just the two of us how different things would be
no one could come between us from now on
the wagging tongues would speak no more the sounds of gossip gone
without a prying ear to fall upon
no we can't control the evil that surround us
but as long as we're together that's enough
though we have no power over those around us
we can act as if there's just the two of us
[ el.banjo - fiddle ]
though clouds of doubt may drift about upon a stormy sea
i'll only draw you nearer onto me
as long as we're together we'll never walk alone
we'll build a world of sunshine of our own
no we can't control the evil...

my friends never understood my rough and rowdy ways

i can't say i've come this far with my guitar on pure dumb luck.
that's not to say i know it all 'cause every time
i get too high up on my horse i fall.
"'cause i've got somethin' lifting me up,"
somethin' holdin' me down.
somethin' to give me wings and keep my feet on the ground.
"i've got all i need, jesus and gravity."
but i'm as bad as anyone
takin' all these blessin's in my life for granted one by one.
"when i start to thinkin' it's all me, well,"
somethin' comes along and knocks me right back on my knees.
"and i've got somethin' lifting me up,"
somethin' holding me down.
somethin' to give me wings and keep my feet on the ground.
"i've got all i need, jesus and gravity."
"he's my friend, he's my light."
"he's my wings, he is my flight."
"and i've got somethin' lifting me up,"

somethin' holdin' me down.
somethin' to give me wings and keep my feet on the ground.
"i've got all i'll ever need,"
'cause i've got jesus and gravity.
"oh, i've got somethin' lifting me up,"
somethin' holding me down.
somethin' to give me wings and keep my feet on the ground.
"i've got all i'll need, 'cause i've got jesus and gravity."
"jesus, i've got jesus, i've got jesus."
"he's my everything. he lifts me up, he gives me wings."
"he gives me hope and he gives me strength,"
and that's all i'll ever need as long as he keeps lifting me.
"he is my life, he's my guide."
"he is my wings, he is my flight."
"lift me, i got jesus,"
i've got jesus and that's all i need.

he's long gone lost john
long gone lost john
no hat on his head no shoes on his feet

lost john walked around in rain
around the corner left him sittin' by the ol' railroad

bodies falling
never again will you catch me admiring
those vast september skies.
"october skies,"

from azure october skies.

sometimes when the night calls it a day
and i wake up down in this missing you kind of way
and i remember things better left forgotten
and sometimes when i'm holding someone new
i can't help myself i slip off and think of you
and i remember things better left forgotten
why oh why won't my mind let go of a love that used to be
and though i try in my heart i know your memory will never set me free
and sometimes right out of the blue i hear a voice and i turn and look for you
and i remember things better left forgotten
why oh why won't my mind let go...
sometimes when the nights calls it a day
and i wake up down in this missing you kind of way i remember

"he says, ""i'm just a man, i work with my hands"
but lately no work has been around
i wish that i could put more on the table
"provide the life i'm sure my family dreams about"""
"""but there's cracks in all the walls and all the windows"
"and the flies, they find their way in through the screen"
i just pray that hope will go on living
"in this house of a thousand dreams"""
"she says, ""my husband's a good man"
gives all that he can
i know he thinks he's let me down
i just want him and the children to be happy
"it's not always easy, but it's all i dream about"""
"""so i'll find some yard-sale curtains for the windows"
and i'll sew some yellow trim along the seams
and i'll keep praying hope will go on living
"in this house of a thousand dreams"""
"the boy says, ""my daddy's a strong man"
"my momma, she loves him"
and they love my brother and sister and me
sometimes at night we lay out in the backyard
"and take turns wishing on the first star we see"""
"""and the crickets always sing outside the windows"
and i love to feel the wind blow through the screen
and i sure hope that we can live forever
"in this house of a thousand dreams"""
"""yeah i sure hope that we can live forever"

"revenge must be the reason,"
why forgiveness was a thing i never knew.
"and someday soon i know you plan to hurt me,"
but don't plan on getting by with the things you do.
cause i'll always know when you been cheating.
and i'll always know you've been untrue.
i'll always know.
"your heart is like a window,"
but when i look inside i see another man.
"but go on and lie and tell him how you fooled me,"
but remember i saw through you're evil plan.
cause i'll always know when you been cheating.
and i'll always know you've been untrue.
i'll always know.
and don't forget it either.
funny thing about dreamers
when the dream is in their sights
just to get where they're goin'
they leave a lot of good things behind
guess you could call me a dreamer
and i've seen it all come true
so i smile when i need to look happy
and do all the things they tell me to
yeah i'm a big self-made man
and a fool who can't understand
i thought i needed fortune
i thought i needed fame
but all i need is to hear you
whisper my name
if i could only make the future
an extension of my past
i'd take these broken memories
and make those moments last
now that my ship has come
i wonder what have i done
i thought i needed fortune
i thought i needed fame
but all i need is to hear you
whisper my name
i thought i needed fortune
i thought i needed fame
but all i need is to hear you
whisper my name
oh yeah whisper baby
"just for the moment, we'll become lovers"
"forget all our troubles, together again"
"just for the moment, once more we'll discover"
"we still need each other, just for the moment."
"your hand in my hand, stirring up memories"
you always could get me with the flash of an eye
"but that ain't the reason, we didn't make it"
we just couldn't take it after a while.
"just for the moment, we'll become lovers"
"forget all our troubles, together again"
"just for the moment, once more we'll discover"
"we still need each other, just for the moment."
"love always changes, strangers to lovers"
"and lovers to strangers, when it comes to an end"
"and all we could salvage, out of a fire"
"was our desire, a spark in the wind."
"just for the moment, we'll become lovers"
"forget all our troubles, together again"
"just for the moment, once more we'll discover"
"we still need each other, just for the moment."
"we still need each other, just for the moment"
i knock off with a lot on my mind
from a long hard day
"pull in at home, see you and find"
my stress slipping away
then you run to my arms
and give me a kiss
and nothing else matters
when you hold me like this
"girl, i'm in the mood to be your man"
to win your heart all over again
"let my eyes trace, let my lips taste"
nothing but you
i'm in the mood to close the door
make love tonight like never before
"rush after rush, like waves on the shore"
"girl, i'm in the mood"
all day long i'm so strong
then i hear you speak
"i'm drawn to your fire, your signs of desire"
"girl, you make me weak"
i go drifting away
like a leaf in the wind
i'm under a spell
your touch put me in
"girl, i'm in the mood to be your man"
to win your heart all over again
"let my eyes trace, let my lips taste"
nothing but you
"yeah, i'm in the mood to close the door"
make love tonight like never before
"rush after rush, like waves on the shore"
"girl, i'm in the mood"

there's no love left our love's beyond help
why do we keep on tryin' when there's no love left
the feeling we felt for each other for a long time now has been dying
we'd both be better off without each other
we can't bring it back to life why do we keep trying
there's no love left...
when love is gone it's gone and you can't bring it back
when the warm sun goes down it turns cold
we both might as well just accept the fact there's nothing warm left for us to
hold
there's no love left...
there's no love left...
saint mother maria watch over us please
as we wonder around in this dangerous world
thank mother maria there's nothing so sweet
as the undying love of a south texas girl
three in the front seat they sat on each side
that green-and-white 58 fairlane it would glide
down farm roads past open fields seeming like no big deal
as it was happening i never felt a thing
but now looking back it seems like it was everything
singing with mom just so we could hear ourselves sing
stealing a drink from the cold can in daddy's lap
protected by only a small thin brown paper sack
and the wind blew the echoes of long-faded voices
and they'd sing me a song that the old cowboys sang
and i didn't know what the words meant or anything
i was just singing because i was supposed to
sing mother maria watch over us please
as we wonder around in this dangerous world
thank mother maria there's nothing so sweet
as the undying love of a south texas girl
and with the windows wide open it felt hot to us anyway
three bound together on a day just like any day
they told me and taught me and showed me and bought me
whatever i wanted from the corner u-tote-m
they say the name corpus christi means the body of jesus
pronounce it refugio city folks they don't know
it looks like palacios but sounds like
just listen the next time you're watchin' sid lasher
and the wind blew the echoes of long-faded voices
and they would sing me a song that the old cowboys sang
and i didn't know what the words meant or anything
i was just singing
saint mother maria watch over us please
as we wonder around in this dangerous world
thank mother maria there's nothing so sweet
as the undying love of a south texas girl
and i didn't know what the words meant or anything
i was just singing
and these days with car seats and open container laws
social correctness leaves no room for santa claus
sitting right next to me she looks like that used to be
song that they sang for me
and with the windows wide open it feels hot to us anyway
two bound together on a day just like any day
the wind blows the echoes of long-faded voices
and they sing us a song that the old cowboys sang
and now that i know what the words mean and everything
i am still singing
saint mother maria watch over us please
as we wonder around in this dangerous world
thank mother maria there's nothing so sweet
as the undying love of a south texas girl
saint mother maria watch over us please
as we stumble around in this dangerous world
thank mother maria there's nothing so sweet
as the undying love of a south texas girl
as the undying love of a south texas girl
saint mother maria watch over us please
as we wonder around in this dangerous world
thank mother maria there's nothing so sweet
as the undying love of a south texas girl
saint mother maria watch over us please
as we wonder around in this dangerous world
thank mother maria there's nothing so sweet
as the undying love of a south texas girl

if you want some good advice don't let her go she's the one who stood by you
what is this thing you both have become that leaves love undecided
don't walk away don't run from yourself it's not her for somebody else
it's not a rainbow you see through tears in your eyes don't think love is onesided
word that were spoken never to be broken to walk as one for a lifetime
then comes the doubt and all those greener pasture that leaves love undecided
don't walk away...
[ steel - guitar ]
the earth is worn her sides are torn and tattered like the sand the ocean gathers
they are as one and no devinely god believe in love reunited
don't walk away...
don't think love is onesided
i can't eat and i can't sleep all i do is sit and cry
and listen for your footsteps at the door
i keep asking myself why we ever said goodbye
and i guess i shed a million tears or more
on my mind on my mind you're always in my heart and on my mind
once i thought my love had died but darling here's what i'd find
you're always in my heart and on my mind
[ fiddle - dobro ]
seems i miss you most of all when twilight shadows fall
what a fool i was to ever let you go
if longing for you now could only bring you back somehow
you'd be here in these lonely arms i know
on my mind on my mind...
round like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel
never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
like a snowball down a mountain or a carnival baloon
like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
like a clock those hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
and the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind
like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
or the ripples from a peble someone tosses in a stream
like a clock those hands...
keys that jingle in your pocket words that jingle in your head
why did summer go so quickly was it something that you said
lovers walk along the shore and leave their footprints in the sand
is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand
pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
half remembered names and faces but to whom do they belong
when you knew what it was over you were suddenly aware
that the autumn leaves were turning to the color of his hair
like a circle in a spiral...
like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel
never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
as the images unwind like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind
when did you stop loving me
how long have i been a memory
i've got to know for my own sanity
tell me when did you stop loving me
was it that night that you stayed out until dawn
you know that night has haunted me for so long
or was your love already cold
tell me please i've got to know
"darling, when did you stop loving me"
there was a time when you worshiped where i stood
heaven knows i'd bring it back if i could
i can tell when we make love
it aint me you're thinking of
tell me when did you stop loving me
"darling, when did you stop loving me"
"written by m. axton, b. levey and g. reeves"
"(as recorded by patsy cline november 8, 1956)"
once my love was good enough
true happiness we knew
then fame and fortune came your way
and made a change in you
you'll find your ladder of success
is not on solid ground
and when it starts to tumble
pick me up on your way down
pick me up when dreams are shattered
when false friends cannot be found
for you know i'll still be waiting
pick me up on your way down
"you've hit the top, but it won't last"
there's just one way to go
the world you've chosen is not real
these things you'll come to know
when folks say they don't know you
and you've lost your final round
when you find that you are lonely
pick me up on your way down
was it wonderful for you
was it holly as it was for me
did you feel the hand of destiny
that was guiding us together
you were young enough to dream
and i was old enough
to learn something new
i'm so glad
i got to dance with you
for a moment of forever
sometimes
when you're cryin you're happy
and sometimes you're just cryin
"i know, i know"
and come whatever happens now
ain't it nice to know
that dreams still come true
i'm so glad
that i was close to you
for a moment of forever
(repete 3 estrofe)
i keep a close watch on this heart of mine i keep my eyes wide open all the time
i keep the ends out for the ties that bind because you're mine i walk the line
i find it very very easy to be true i find myself alone when each day's through
yes i'll admit that i'm a fool for you because you're mine i walk the line
[ guitar - steel ]
you've got a way to keep me on your side you give me cause for love that i can't hide
for you i know i'd even try to turn the tide because you're mine i walk the line
as sure as night is dark and day is light i keep you on my mind both day and night
and happiness i've known proves that it's right because you're mine i walk the line
another date with the devil on saturday night
another bible in my hand on sunday morning
"last one, i left standin' in the drive"
said a heart like mine oughta come with a warning
"can't help it, i'm in love with love"
"i got a track record, a past that's checkered"
as the floor at the diner on main street
"a heart wrecker, a runner under pressure"
like a dang mustang on high speed
maybe it's the ones that i can't fix
and maybe it's the chase that makes me tick
"girls like me don't mean to, but we don't know better"
i got a track record
one might have been a keeper and one was a leaver
and one was the one daddy gave me away to
one's a user and one was a loser
still waitin' on the one to give my whole damn heart to
"can't help it, i'm in love with love"
"i got a track record, a past that's checkered"
as the floor at the diner on main street
"a heart wrecker, runner under pressure"
like a dang mustang on high speed
maybe it's the ones that i can't fix
and maybe it's the chase that makes me tick
"girls like me don't mean to, but we don't know better"
i got a track record
maybe it's the ones that i can't fix
maybe it's the ones that makes me tick
"girls like me don't mean to, but we don't know better"
i got a track record
i got a track record
"i can't help it, i'm in love with love"
"i can't help it, i'm in love with love"
little girl sorrow comes knocking at my door
i give her what i can but she always wants more
and i want to borrow the future so it doesn't hurt
but i know it's gotta hurt
grief stays outside your house until you let it in
sits down for tea and you tell it about where you've been
"and it listens, and you feel"
"and it whispers, and you heal"
and suddenly it leaves you free
oh goliath guilt is hiding in my cupboard
she dresses me up in darkness till i'm covered
"and i want to skip to forgiveness, disguise all my doubts"
but i've gotta face it now
grief stays outside your house until you let it in
sits down for tea and you tell it about where you've been
"and it listens, and you feel"
"and it whispers, and you heal"
and suddenly it leaves you free
my friend peace is out there somewhere waiting
"sitting in sunlight, smiling ever patient"
and i want to tell her i'm coming but she already knows
as soon as i let it go
today i sat alone at my window
and i watched our little girl outside at play
with the little boy next door like so many times before
but something didn't seem quite right today
so i went outside to see what they were doing
and then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim
cause i heard him name a game and i hung my head in shame
when i heard our little girl say to him
i don't wanna play house i know it can't be fun
i watched mommy and daddy and if that's the way it's done
i don't wanna play house it makes my mommy cry
cause when she played house my daddy said goodbye
i don't wanna play house...

two streaks of steel stretchin' cross the land too far to reach for my baby's hand
i stood and watched her disappear and in the distance i could hear whooe
tomorrow i'll see coming down the track
that same old train that she ain't coming back
for her sweet love that once was mine faded just like a whistle's whine whooe
two streaks of steel i've been standing beside
where all that mattered in my life just died
i want to lay across those tracks when that train
crossed those two streaks steel once again
two streaks of steel took my love away no reason now for me to wanna stay
next time i'll hear that whistle moan that all my troubles will be gone whooe whooe
(hugh martin/ralph blane)

"on a good day, when i think about her"
i only cry a couple hundred tears
"on a good day, when i can?t forget about her"

i?m not havin? on a good day.
so set em up
here?s a hundred dollars keep em comin? joe (whoa whoa)

"on a good day, i become the kind of man that even"
i can barely tolerate
and as you can plainly see
i?m not havin? on a good day.
"on a good day, i would never crash a party"
knowin? she?d be there with someone else
"and on a good day, i would have stopped before i started"
to make a major fool of myself
"on a good day, i?d been quick enough to duck"
before her new love punched me in the face
but as you can plainly see
i?m not havin? on a good day.
so set em up
here?s a hundred dollars keep em comin? joe (whoa whoa)

dawn is slowly breaking our friends have all gone home
you and i are waiting for santa claus to come
there's a present by the tree stockings on the wall
knowing you're in love with me is the greatest gift of all
the fire is slowly fading chill is in the air
all the gifts are waiting for children everywhere
through the window i can see snow begin to fall
knowing you're in love with me is the greatest gift of all
just before i go to sleep i hear a church bell ring
merry christmas everyone is the song it sings
so i play a silent prayer for creatures great and small
peace on earth good will to men is the greatest gift of all
peace on earth good will to men is the greatest gift of all
i'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids

a long time forgotten the dreams that just fell by the way
the good life he promised ain't what she's been living today
but she never complains of bad times and the bad things he's done
she just talks about the good they've had
and all the good times to come
she's a good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man
she loves him in spite of his wicked ways she don't understand
through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass through this world hand in hand
this good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' man
he likes the bright lights the night life
and the good timin' friends
and when the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
lord she don't understand but she does the very best that she can
she's a good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' man
i'm so glad to have you back within these arms of mine
i can finally go to sleep and get some rest
never once did i think of finding someone new
"'cause there's nothing better, once you've had the best"
you're the very thing they sing about in love songs
and one mistake don't mean you've failed the test
"as i lay beside you softly sleeping this i know,"
"there's nothing better, once you've had the best"
"within your arms, i've had the best"
and i think the world should know
i don't care what you've said or done
i'll always love you so
"you've got more love in your little finger, than all the rest"
"and there's nothing better, once you've had the best"
"within your arms, i've had the best"
and i think the world should know
i don't care what you've said or done
i'll always love you so
"you've got more love in your little finger, than all the rest"
"and there's nothing better, once you've had the best"
"no there's nothing better, once you've had the best"
i've rehearsed this day a thousand times
i've played this scene out in my mind
"you spread your wings, you need to fly"
it breaks my heart to say goodbye
these arms of mine wanna pull you close
but i love you enough to let you go
my mind goes back to memories
of pony rides upon my knee
"first day of school, your brand new bike"
and football games on friday nights
and through the years i've watched you grow
and i love you enough to let you go
don't look back when you drive away
i don't wanna change your mind
i know in all your eighteen years
you've never seen your daddy cry
so many things i wanna say
"you'll meet new friends, you'll be okay"
i'll pray for you out on your own
but don't forget your way back home
and though i may not let it show
i love you enough to let you go
don't look back when you drive away
i don't wanna change your mind
i know in all your eighteen years
you've never seen your daddy cry
these arms of mine wanna pull you close
but i love you enough to let you go
"it's sunday morning, the coffee's on"
that gray cat's still yawning
because saturday is gone
and i still feel the feeling
of how you felt upon me
and it may be no big deal to you
but it's a very big deal to me
you were down and dirty
and he was tall and twenty nine
and i'm only disconcerted
because you said you knew i wouldn't mind
but i still feel the feeling
of how you telephone me
and it may be no big deal to you
but it's a very big deal to me
but you can't make a cool cat crazy
like you can't make a gray cat brown
and you can't keep a wild cat
when she knows the wildest cat's in town
so it's sunday morning
yeah and i guess i had it comin'
ooh 'cause i start recalling
a time i went astray
and i still feel the feeling
of her last words of warning
"she said, ""man, it may be no big deal to you"
"but it's a very big deal to me"""
"she said, ""man, it may be no big deal to you"
"but it's a very big deal to me"""
why did she have to go
so young i just don't know why
things happen half the time
without reason without rhyme
"lovely, sweet young woman"
"daughter, wife and mother"
makes no sense to me
i just have to believe
she flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
by the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
and she walks with jesus and her loved ones waiting
and i know she's smiling saying
don't worry 'bout me
loved ones she left behind
just trying to survive
and understand the why
feeling so lost inside
anger shot straight at god
then asking for his love
empty with disbelief
just hoping that maybe
she flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
by the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
and she walks with jesus and her loved ones waiting
and i know she's smiling saying
don't worry 'bout me
it's hard to say goodbye
her picture in my mind
they'll always be of times i'll cherish
and i won't cry 'cause
she flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
by the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
and she walks with jesus and her loved ones waiting
and i know she's smiling saying
don't worry 'bout me
don't worry 'bout me
i never liked the taste of whiskey
til i kissed it off of her lips
"never knew just what was hitting me, getting me tipsy"
"but there i sit, levi's on a dogwood branch"
"yeah, she was taking me under"
i might have lost my innocence
but she was saving my soul that summer
i don't know much about eternity
or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
all i know is that i have already been
parked in a chevy by the deep river rolling
"and that summer night, shooting star paradise"
might be all that i'm getting
kissing and sipping that seven and seven
somewhere just south of heaven
she might have been a fallen angel
"nah, i didn't care at all"
i never thought a prayer could be answered
"with a whispered, sweet southern drawl"
even now when i close my eyes
i see her silhouette dance on the river
the way we spent those endless nights
that's the way i could spend forever
i don't know much about eternity
or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
all i know is that i have already been
parked in a chevy by the deep river rolling
"and that summer night, shooting star paradise"
might be all that i'm getting
kissing and sipping that seven and seven
somewhere just south of heaven
somewhere just beyond the jericho line
"little white church, roll back through the pines"
down where the three cross river unwinds
"if there's a heaven on earth, man that'd be mine"
i don't know much about eternity
or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
all i know is that i have already been
parked in a chevy by the deep river rolling
"and that summer night, shooting star paradise"
might be all that i'm getting
kissing and sipping that seven and seven
somewhere just south of heaven
"oh yeah, just south of heaven"
somewhere just beyond the jericho line
"little white church, roll back through the pines"
down where the three cross river unwinds
"if there's a heaven on earth, man that'd be mine"
"yeah, that'd be mine"
"oh, just a little bit south of heaven, mm yeah"
no one will ever know my heart is breaking
although a million teardrops start to flow
i'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
i'll miss you but no one will ever know
i'll tell them we grew tired of each other
and realized our dreams could never be
i'll even make believe i never loved you
then no one will ever know the truth but me
no one will ever know how much i'm pining
each time the past comes back to haunt me so
no one will ever see the tears i'm hiding
you've hurt me but no one will ever know
i'll tell them i found true love with another
that i was glad the day you set me free
i'll even make believe i never loved you
then no one will ever know the truth but me
christina our first born you are so soft and warm as you lie between us softly sleeping

"donna on my mind when i get up in the morning,donna on my mind the whole day through,love can't come so quick and real without any warning wonder if she's thinking of me too."
"once i thought that no one girl could ever hold me even thought this thing called love was just fantasy,now i won't be satisfied until she's mine,'till then i'll just have donna on my mind."
"once i thought that no one girl could ever hold me even thought this thing called love was just fantasy,now i won't be satisfied until she's mine,'till then i'll just have donna on my mind."
i gave two teeth in a teenage brawl
for a girl whose name i can't recall
then we broke up
i gave a knee to the football team
chasing that highschool state champ dream
we almost won
i gave junior college almost a year
then i gave a greyhound twenty bucks
and that's how i got here
"i give all my money, for a slice of daily bread"
i give forty honest hours to a boss i never met
and i gave my soul to jesus at the age of twenty-two
so there in't much left to offer
but i give my heart to you
i gave a beard and a head of hair
to a boot camp corporal with a barber's chair
at camp lejeune
i gave uncle sam what he bargained for
"twenty-four months, not a minute more"
i just didn't fit in
then i gave a highschool friend of mine a call
and we gave a body shop a try
'til we gave up last fall
"i do alright, most of the time"
"i've learned to move on, i've learned to get by"
but sometimes i can't find the reason to be free
so i leave a light on for your memory
i leave a light on for your memory
so it will be easy to come back to me
"when it's late and i'm alone, i need some place to be"
i leave a light on for your memory
you found a new love and i'd like to believe
that you're really better off without me
the good days have slipped away but i sometimes dream
so i leave a light on for your memory
i leave a light on for your memory
so it will be easy to come back to me
"when it's late and i'm alone, i need some place to be"
i leave a light on for your memory
"yeah, when it's late and i'm alone, i need some place to be"
i leave a light on for your memory
water towers are made for hearts and names

summer jobs are made for spendin' cash
second dates are made for goin' fast
early curfews are made for sneakin' past
2 am was made for pissed off dads
"and i was made for you, yeah i was made for you"
like a ship without a sea

'cause i was made for you
"smoky bars are made for ""how 'bout a dance? """
open roads are made for holdin' hands and
laid back seats are made for young love

she'd slip away each day with the dimming light
and with the sweetest smile she'd kiss the child goodnight
at the mill she'd work her fingers till they were raw
for the sake of her son and the daddy he never saw
mary danced with soldiers
she stepped a light quadrille
shawl across her shoulders
"to keep away the chill, to keep away the chill"
it was a rebel boy who brought her joy they say
though the years had passed the memories stood fast each day
before a bullet crushed the life of their romance
he gave her a shawl and a parasol from france
mary danced with soldiers
she stepped a light quadrille
shawl across her shoulders
"to keep away the chill, to keep away the chill"
they came around to the tavern in town that night
and with silent cries mary never tried to fight
they cut her hair and left her body torn
her spirit slipped away before the dawn
mary danced with soldiers
but now her body's still
shawl across her shoulders
to keep away the chill
mary danced with soldiers
she stepped a light quadrille
shawl across her shoulders
"to keep away the chill, to keep away the chill"
i knew a man called him sandy kane
few folks even knew his name
but a hero yes was he
"left a boy, came back a man"
still many just don't understand
about the reasons we are free
i can't forget the look in his eyes
or the tears he cries
as he said these words to me
all gave some and some gave all
"and some stood through for the red, white and blue"
and some had to fall
and if you ever think of me
think of all your liberties and recall
some gave all
now sandy kane is no longer here
but his words are oh so clear
as they echo through out our land
for all his friends who gave us all
who stood the ground and took the fall
to help their fellow man
love your country and live with pride
and don't forget those who died america can't you see
all gave some and some gave all
"and some stood through for the red, white and blue"
and some had to fall
and if you ever think of me
think of all your liberties and recall
some gave all
and if you ever think of me
"think of all your liberties and recall, yes recall"
some gave all
some gave all
there's a picture that i carry one we made some time ago
when they ask who's in the picture with me i say just someone i used to know
just someone i used to spend some time with just a flame that lost its glow
i don't tell them how lost i am without you i say just someone i used to know
[ steel ]
just someone i used to run around with just a friend from long ago
i don't tell them how lost i am without you i say just someone i used to know
i say just someone i used to know
there is a name i love to hear
i love to sing its worth
it sounds like music in my ear
the sweetest name on earth
"oh, how i love jesus"
"oh, how i love jesus"
"oh, how i love jesus"
because he first loved me
it tells me of a savior's love
who died and set me free
it tells me of his precious blood
the sinner's perfect plea
"oh, how i love jesus"
"oh, how i love jesus"
"oh, how i love jеsus"
because he first lovеd me
jesus first loved me
he tells of one whose loving heart
can feel my deepest woe
who in each sorrow bears a part
that none can bear below
"oh, how i love jesus"
"oh, how i love jesus"
"oh, how i love jesus"
"because he first loved me, yeah"
because he first loved me
she said if i ever deceive her
"she'd be gone before i could count ten,"
i guess that i didn't believe her;
oh just look at the trouble i'm in.
"gone, gone, gone, cryin' won't bring her back;"
"the more that i cry, the faster that plane flies"
father across the sky.
"well i lost every right to be happy,"
well i lost all the heaven i found;
"she warned me she'd leave and she left me,"
before my first tear hit the ground.
if i only knew where i could find her
well i'd crawl there on my hands and knees.
'cause each tick of the clock will remind her
that she's one second farther from me.
{instrumental}
farther across the sky.
i watched from my window as she slipped from the house
"once again she's leaving, but lord, she's not to blame"
this morning a memory phoned her and he's a habit she can't break
"so 'til she returns, i'll wait for her,"
looking out my window through the pain
the devil drove the taxi that carried her away
and it hurts to know she's hung up on some guy from yesterday
once again she's chasing memories and i'm losing everything
"but i love her, so i'll wait for her,"
looking out my window through the pain
i'll pick up the pieces when he lets her down again
"with love and understanding, i'll give her reasons this time to stay"
and i'll close my eyes pretending maybe someday she will change
"and i won't be left lonely,"
looking out my window through the pain
"yes, the devil drove the taxi that carried her away"
and it hurts to know she's still hung up on some guy from yesterday
once again she's chasing memories and i'm losing everything
"but lord i love her, so i'll wait for her,"
those city lights drew you like a magnet
you were attracted to his high-falootin’ crowd
"i begged you not to go, but you still packed up"
i’ve been expectin’ you
"oh, look who’s back from town"
my old truck could not compare to his mercedes
did it humble you when you rode back on that greyhound
you picked a plastic rose and left a field of daisies
i’ve been expectin’ you
"oh, look who’s back from town"
what brings you back to this part of the country
"well let me guess, ol’ loverboy let you down"
did he throw you away like his money
i’ve been expectin’ you
"oh, look who’s back from town"
i’ve been expectin’ you
"oh, look who’s back from town"
she placed her ring on the sill
dishes piled high
she's on the front porch step
and the air smells like snow
she's thinking of the siege to come
and how she'll miss those weekends in the park
"with the sun on her face, and her book by her side"
and that lingering taste that he left on her tounge
he lifts his glass from the table
it leaves a ring where it stood
he sees a light from a window
caress her like he knows he should
he's remembering the first time he kissed her
and how he'd wake and immediately he'd miss her
"like a spell, with each breath"
he'd taste her breath like a haunting
irritating as hell
do you remember when you prayed you'd never see the day
someone would make you feel this way
'cause you knew it would cut right through you
"once inside, you were afraid they'd find"
nothing to hold on to
he puts her ring on her finger
she brushes back his hair
he takes a sip from his glass
she inhales the cold fall air
they're thinking of the long road ahead
and the strength that they'll need just to reach the end
"and there in the silence, they search for the balance"
between this fear that they feel
and a love that has graced their lives
as we were dressing to go out our little girl and boy
came in and asked if they could go this time
we told them little girls and boys don't belong at parties
and that they should be in bed asleep by nine
the babysitter came in then and we kissed the kids goodbye
and told them that we'd be home soon and told them not to cry
then we left for the party like we'd so often done
thinkin' only of ourselves and not our little ones
the party started out wild and it grew wilder as the night wore on
with drinking laughing teling dirty jokes nobody thinkin' of home
then the stranger feeling came over me and it chilled me to the bones
and i told my wife that we'd better leave the party
cause i felt that we were needed at home
as we rode along i got to thinking of how the kids that mornin'
had asked if we would take them to church the next day
and how i'd put 'em off like i'd so often done
by sayin' we'd probably get home too late
then my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of sirens
as they cut through the still night air
then we turned down our street that's when we saw the fire
the rest was like a nightmare
we took their little bodies to church the next day
though we'd left the party early we still got home too late
"yeah, you and your friends, ten years old"
sneaking beech nut on back in the row
sell it at a market on saturdays
halloween getting lost with a girl in the maze
throwing cobs at the cars that are passing
sheriff comes out and you hide and you laugh
"you're praying for the sun, praying for the rain"
praying over muffins that your grandma made
"corn in the truck, corn in the field"
corn in the bottom of a moonshine still
"corn in a kettle, corn in a skillet"
"corn in a jug, hot damn you can feel it"
"corn for the chicken, corn for the deer"
corn for as far as you can see around here
leanin' on a fence in a carhartt hat with a farmer's tan
"sayin', ""man, look at all that corn"""
"yeah, all that corn"
"yeah, it ain't no wonder why you love it"
you got your first kiss in a barn full of it
"drank your first beer, lеarned to play guitar"
at a turnrow party with a tailgate bar
farmer's daughtеr and a john deere man
"saving your money, put a ring on her hand"
now you're raising more than a silver queen
in a little farmhouse by a field of dreams
"corn in the truck, corn in the field"
corn in the bottom of a moonshine still
"corn in a kettle, corn in a skillet"
"corn in a jug, hot damn you can feel it"
"corn for the chicken, corn for the deer"
corn for as far as you can see around here
from the ohio river to the northern plat
"every highway, byway"
"hey, look at all that corn"
all that corn
"yeah, corn in a bag that you toss in a hole"
corn on a hook at the end of a pole
corn popping up at the movie in a bucket
"first you gotta grow it, gotta pick it, gotta shuck it"
"corn in the truck, corn in the field"
corn in the bottom of a moonshine still
"corn in a kettle, corn in a skillet"
"corn in a jug, hot damn you can feel it"
"corn for the chicken, corn for the deer"
corn for as far as you can see around here
end this song the way it began
started with a c and end with a n
"corn, yeah, all that corn"
corn
if i ever write
the story of my life
don't be surprised if you're where it begins
"girl, i'd have to dedicate"
every line on every page
to the memories we made
while you loved me...
i was born the day you kissed me
and i died inside the night you left me
but i lived
oh i how i lived while you loved me
i'd start with chapter one
"love, innocent and young as the mornin' sun, on a new day"
even though i know the end
i'd do it all again
cuz i got a lifetime in
while you loved me
i was born the day you kissed me
and i died inside the night you left me
"but i lived, oh i live while you loved me..."

"little red riding hood, big bad world"

i ain't the kind you take home to mama
i ain't the kind to wear no ring
somehow i always get stronger
when i'm on my second drink
even though i hate to admit it
sometimes i smoke cigarettes
the christian folks say i should quit it
"and i just smile and say ""god bless"""
cause i heard jesus he drank wine
and i bet we'd get along just fine
he could calm a storm and heal the blind
and i bet he'd understand a heart like mine
daddy cried when he saw my tattoo
but said he loved me anyway
my brother got the brains of the family
so i thought i'd learn to sing
cause i heard jesus he drank wine
and i bet we'd get along just fine
he could calm a storm and heal the blind
and i bet he'd understand a heart like mine
and i'll fly away from it all one day
"and i'll fly, i'll fly away"
but these are the days that i will remember
when my names called on a roll
he'll meet me with two long stem glasses
and make a toast to me coming home
cause i heard jesus he drank wine
and i bet we'd get along just fine
he could calm a storm and heal the blind
and i bet he'd understand
understand a heart like mine
oh yes he would
it was painted red
it's stripe was white
it was 18 feet
from the bow to the stern light
2nd hand from a dealer in atlanta
i rode up with daddy
when he went there to get it
put on a shine
put on a motor
built out of love
made for water
ran it for years
till the transom got rotton
a piece of my childhood that'll never be forgotten
"it was, just an old plywood boat"
75 johnson with an electric choke
"a young boy, two hands on the wheel"
i cant replace the way it made me feel
"and i would turn it shore line, and, make it wide"
"he'd say, ya can't beat the way an old boat rides"
just a little lake across the alabama line
"but i was king of the ocean, when daddy let me drive"
"just an old 1/2 ton, short-bed ford"
"my uncle bought new, in '64"
daddy got it right
cause the engine was smokin'
couple burnt valves and he had it goin'
he'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
"down a dirt strip, where we'd dump trash"
off of thickpin road
i would sit on the seat
and stretch my feet out to the pedals
smiling like a hero that just received his medal
it was just an old hand-me-down ford
with a 3 speed on the column
a dent in the door
"a young boy, 2 hands on the wheel"
"i can't replace the way it, made me feel"
and i would press that clutch and i'd keep it right
he'd say a lil' slower son you're doin' just fine
just a dirt road with trash on each side
but i was mario andretti
when daddy let me drive
im grown up now 3 daughters of my own
i let 'em drive my old jeep
cross the pasture at our home
maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
and pull out that old memory
"and think of me and smile, and say"
just an old worn out jeep
with rusty ole floor boards
and hot on my feet
"a young girl, two hands on the wheel"
"i can't replace the way it, made me feel"
"and he'd say, turn it left now, and steer it right"
"straighten up girl now, you're doin' just fine"
just a lil' valley by the river where we'd ride
"but i was high on a mountain, when daddy let me drive"
when daddy let me drive
when daddy lt me drive
oh he'd let me drive
it was just an old plywood boat with a 75 johnson n'electric choke
"it's bottles and bibs, rattles and cribs"
three am's again and again
comfort the cry
"man, it's flying by"
swings and slides and tricycle rides
skinning up knees and falling out of trees
it's like it's never gonna end
but it's flying by
you better hold on tight to those little lives
in the blink of an eye it's out of sight
"i know, i know to go so slow"
but it's flying by
then it's braces and boots and bad attitudes
boys and phones and every change in moods
"trying times, man, but you'll survive"
and it's supposed to be home at ten
you're late again
where the heck you been
when you're yelling and screaming
it don't seem like it's flying by
but it's flying by
you better hold on tight to those changing lives
in the blink of an eye they're out of sight
"i know, i know it seems so slow"
but it's flying by
there they go on their own
flying by
you're waving good bye with a tear in your eye
"i know, i know you go so slow but it's flying by"
they come back home and what do you know
them kids have got some kids of their own
you can't believe how much they've grown
and where the time's gone
you look in the mirror there's gray in your hair
you're wondering how the world did that get there
it just ain't fair how it's flying by
"you better hold on tight to that sweet, sweet life"
in the blink of an eye they're out of sight
"i know, i know it goes so slow"
but it's flying by
when it's hospital beds
"last words said, did i do enough"
holding hands and being there for the leaving
it's a line of cars parked on a hill
family and friends perfectly still
a prayer and a song as they lowered it down into the ground
"you better hold on tight it's a short, short life"
in the blink of an eye it's out of sight
"i know, i know it seems so slow"
"yeah, it seems so slow but it's flying by"
it's flying by
it's flying by
it's flying by
enjoy the ride
"slow down, you move too fast"
you got to make the morning last
just kicking down the cobble stones
looking for fun and feelin' groovy.
"hello lamppost, what cha knowing?"
i've come to watch your flowers growing
ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
"doot-in' doo-doo, feelin' groovy."
"got no deeds to do, no promises to keep"
i'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
let the morning time drop all its petals on me
"life, i love you, all is groovy...."
this ain't no candlelight
warm glass of wine night
it's more a whiskey water
drink that's on the rocks kind
let's crank the radio

(paul brandt/josh leo/rick bowles)
pulled down that cardboard box from the attic
the one with the letters from you
put on those old records while i was at it
the ones that we fell in love to
thought we were over what a crazy notion
i should have realized
i'd lose the fight against this flood of emotion
welling up from deep inside
there's not a dry eye in the house tonight
just a raging river of heartache and pride
there's not a memory that doesn't cut like a knife
of me letting you just walk out of my life
every teardrop is a visible sign
of me missing you coming out
there's not a dry eye in the house
every picture of when we were together
tear stained and falling apart
"chances i didn't take, regrets and mistakes"
i know them all by broken heart
there's not a dry eye in the house tonight
just a raging river of heartache and pride
there's not a memory that doesn't cut like a knife
of me letting you just walk out of my life
every teardrop is a visible sign
of me missing you coming out
there's not a dry eye in the house
every picture of when we were together
tear stained and falling apart
"chances i didn't take, regrets and mistakes"
i know them all by broken heart
there's not a dry eye in the house tonight
just a raging river of heartache and pride
there's not a memory that doesn't cut like a knife
of me letting you just walk out of my life
every teardrop is a visible sign
of me missing you coming out
there's not a dry eye in the house
every picture of when we were together
tear stained and falling apart
"chances i didn't take, regrets and mistakes"
every morning when you come down stairs
hair's a mess but i don't care
make-up on shining so bright
my old sweatshirt never fit so right
dancing around to the radio
humming the words that don't know
cause i'm finding an angel off my list
thinking that it don't get no better than this
you make loving you easy
you make loving you all i wanna do
every little smile
every single touch
reminds me just how much it all makes
loving you easy
wrapped around me late at night
pillow talk by candlelight
gonna slow this down and make it last
best things fly by so fast
you make loving you easy
you make loving you all i wanna do
every little smile
and every single touch
reminds me just how much it all makes
(ohh i wanna sing it again)
you make loving you easy
you make loving you all i wanna do
every little smile
and every single touch
reminds me just how much it all makes
loving you easy
easy easy
my dad was a big man with a will that was tough
he was at his best when the going was rough
he made a living for the family and never had to cheat
to keep food on the table and shoes on our feet
we sat down at the table and thanked god in prayer
cause we had plenty to eat and plenty to wear
we had patches on our britches but momma kept us neat
we had food on the table and shoes on our feet
we picked the cotton and gathered the corn
we were taught to work from the day we were born
mom and dad and all us children worked in the summer's heat
to keep food on the table and shoes on our feet
when you sit down at the table thank god in prayer
if you've got plenty to eat and plenty to wear
if you've got patches on your britches just be sure to keep em neat
if you've got food on the table and shoes on your feet
have yourself a merry little christmas
let your heart be light
from now on our troubles will be out of sight
have yourself a merry little christmas
make the yuletide gay
from now on our troubles will be miles away
here we are as in olden days
happy golden days of yore
faithful friends who are dear to us
gather near to us once more
through the years we all will be together
if the fates allow
hang a shining star upon the highest bow
and have yourself a merry little christmas now
through the years we all will be together
if the fates allow
hang a shining star upon the highest bow
and have yourself a merry little christmas now
a merry little christmas

"amazing grace, how sweet the sound"
that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost but now i'm found
was blind but now i see
twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
the hour i first believed
"through many dangers, toils and snares"
i have already come
tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
and grace will lead me home
when we've been there ten thousand years
bright shining as the sun
we've no less days to sing god's praise
than when we first begun
"amazing grace, how sweet the sound"
that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost but now i'm found
was blind but now i see
"amazing grace, oh amazing grace"
that saved a wretch like me
"oh amazing grace, amazing grace"
it's you i go to
the one i talk to
'cause you know how to
restore my faith
i know you will be
forever with me
i've been through hell
to find this heaven
i believe we'll last
sent from above
i know you must
be heaven-sent
and i love you ever so much
sent from above
i know you must
be heaven-sent
and i love you ever so much
sent from above
"ooh-oh-ooh-oh, mm-mm-mm"
"ooh-oh-ooh-oh, mm-mm-mm"
and i soar on angel wings
it's heaven when we touch
and i will nеver give you up
sent from abovе
i know you must
be heaven-sent
and i love you ever so much
sent from above
i know you must
be heaven-sent
and i love you ever so much
sent from above
"ooh-oh-ooh-oh, mm-mm-mm"
"ooh-oh-ooh-oh, mm-mm-mm"
"from above, from above"
sent from above
"from above, from above"
sent from above
sent from above
okay i forgot about the trash
i didn't trim the long hairs on my mustache
i did buy you a ring i believe it was back in '93
alright i admit it i forgot our anniversary
but i did pick up the baby this morning at the nursery
that ain't no big thing but it's gold star for me
you get tired and disgusted with me
when i can't be just what you want me to be
i still love you and i try real hard
i swear one day you'll have a brand new car
i even asked the lord to try to help me
he looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
just be patient i'm a work in progress
i'm sorry i got mad waiting in the truck
it seemed like hours you getting all dressed up
just to go to shoney's on a wednesday night
i read that book you gave me about mars and venus
i think it's sinking in but probably need to reread it
but i'm starting to see now what you've been saying is right
you get tired and disgusted with me
when i can't be just what you want me to be
i still love you and i try real hard
i swear one day you'll have a brand new car
i even asked the lord to try to help me
he looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
just be patient i'm a work in progress
i know you meant well when you bought me those clogs
but my heels sure get hot down by the muffler on my hog i'm
sure they're stylish but i'll take my boots
i try to do that healthy thing like you want me to do
"but that low fat, no fat's getting hard to chew"
now i love your cooking honey
but sometimes i need some real food
you get tired and disgusted with me
when i can't be just what you want me to be
i still love you and i try real hard
i swear one day you'll have a brand new car
i even asked the lord to try to help me
he looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
just be patient i'm a work in progress
oh honey just be patient now
i'm a work in progress
intro:
"if you need me, i'll be gone"
the bed's still warm where you just left
but it'll be colder where i've slept
i've always been where you needed me
but i ain't the fool i used to be
you come home all hours of the night
the fragrance on you ain't old spice
tonight when you come draggin' home
"and find you need me, i'll be gone"
i'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up
gone like the dew from the buttercup
gone like a woman treated wrong
"if you need me, i'll be gone"
"so, what am i still doing here?"
you've been doin' me wrong for years
tired of pickin' up and puttin' out
"i'm leaving you lock, stock, and house"
"so, bye, bye, baby"
"that's it, i'm packed"
"i'm a'leavin' now, but i'll call back"
and leave this message on the code-a-phone
"sayin', if you need me, well, i'll be gone"
i'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up
gone like the dew from the buttercup
gone like a woman leavin' home
"if you need me, i'll be gone"
"i said, if you need me, i'll be gone"
tag:
"if you need me, i'll be gone"
"i said, if you need me, i'll be gone"
i can hear that highway calling
as i watch the sunrise
crawling across her shoulder
this is usually goodbye
and yet those words
i just can't find here as i hold her
she's like no other woman
that i have known before
and it ain't me to see the morning sun
from this side of the door
why ain't i running
why ain't i gone
how does she hold me without holding on
in love or a fightm
she's stronger than strong
something's not right
if there ain't nothing wrong
"it's got me wondering, why ain't i running"
why ain't i gone
all those words i left behind me
praying they would never
find me and my freedom
but if they stood right here beside me
they would never recognize me
for all that she's done
once happiness was only
whenever i was on my own
so now why do i feel lonely
any time that i'm alone
"no, they've never built a wall that high"
or made a chain that strong
and god ain't never made a place
i felt like i belong
i've always heard people say it
but i guess i never fully understood it
"i thought that they meant, you'd be easy to forget"
but it's drivin’ me crazy
out of sight out of mind
"you opened my eyes, and now i can see"
"what you mean to me, i was so blind"
out of sight out of mind
you know it hurt when you left me
but i thought life would go on without you
"that was easier said, can't get you outta my head"
i don't know if i'll make it
out of sight out of mind
"you opened my eyes, and now i can see"
"what you mean to me, i was so blind"
out of sight out of mind
i was so blind
out of sight out of mind
today i started loving you again i'm right back where i've really always been
i got over you just long enough to let my heartaches mend
and today i started loving you again
what a fool i was to think i could get by with only these few million tears i cried
i should have known the worst was yet to come
and that crying time for me had just begun
oh today i started loving you again...
i got over you just long enough...
come on hurry
ain't no time for worrying
gotta go
move on
just leave the lights on
"grab some clothes,"
set those sights on
that four-lane road
i'm gone
"in a truck, in a train,"
"in a car, in a bus,"
"change my luck, can't stay"
"goin' far, in a rush"
got that get away feeling
i'm leaving
trust me
something better's gotta be
right around this next turn
gonna be just fine
toss the map don't look behind
push that pedal down
burn
here i go...
leee-aaa-vvv-iiiiing
ohhh...
"in a truck, in a train,"
"in a car, in a bus,"
"change my luck, can't stay"
"goin' far, in a rush"
"white lines, exit signs,"
can't fly fast enough
"blacktop, railway, spinning wheels"
don't stop
got that get away feeling
got that get away feeling
i'm leeeeeeeeeeeeeee-avin'
i'm leavin'
i'm leavin'
i'm leavin'
oh wheels don't stop
"yeah, i'm leaving"
i walked out tonight for a ramble round
i didn't mean to stay just to view the town
when i saw her smiling from afar
as she walked into that crossroads bar
well i walked inside and sat me down
ordered sweet red wine and i drank it down
she came and set beside me there
"with a dark brown eyes and the red, red hair"
i told her that i loved her true
anything you want i'll surely do
said a man like you don't get too far
with a girl like me at the crossroads bar
i like smoky light and a lonesome song
and i won't do right if i can do wrong
you want the moon to burn behind the darkest star
and you won't find love at the crossroads bar
come all my friends and take my advice
keep your love at home with your lovely wife
you're better off than you think you are
and you won't find love at the crossroads bar
why does the sun go on shining why does the sea rush to shore
don't they know it's the end of the world cause you don't love me anymore
why do the birds go on singing why do the stars glow above
don't they know it's the end of the world it ended when i lost your love
i wake up in the morning and i wonder why everything's the same as it was
i can't understand no i can't understand how life goes on the way it does
why does my heart go on beating why do these eyes of mine cry
don't they know it's the end of the world it ended when you said goodbye
why does my heart go on beating and why why do these eyes of mine cry
don't they know it's the end of the world it ended when you said goodbye goodbye
"y'know, sometimes in our lives"
we all have pain
we all have sorrow
but if we are wise
we know that there's
always tomorrow
lean on me when you're not strong
and i'll be your friend
i'll help you carry on
"oh, for, for it won't be long"
'til i'm gonna need
somebody to lean on
"so, please, swallow your pride"
if i have things
you need to borrow
"y'know, no, no one can fill"
those of your needs
that you won't let show
"you just call on me, brother, when you need a hand"
we all need somebody to lean on
"well, i just might have"
a problem that you'll understand
we all need somebody to lean on
lean on me when you're not strong
and i'll be your friend
i'll help you carry on
"for it, it won't be long"
'til i'm gonna need
somebody to lean on
"you just call on me, brother"
when you need a hand
we all need somebody to lean on
"well, i just might have"
a problem that you'll understand
we all need somebody to lean on
"well, if there is a load"
you have to bear
that you can't carry
"i'm right, i'm right up the road"
i'll share your load
if you just will call me
if you need a friend
"oh, call me"
i'll be there
"call me, yeah"
the more you try to put me down
the more i want to hang around
and you know that ain't right.
the more you seem to want to stray
the more i love you everyday
and you know that ain't right.
so put yourself in place of me
i'll push you around and then you'll see
that ain't the way it ought to be
but i can't help myself
i've tried i just accept your little white lies
and you know that ain't right.
the less you seem to care for me
the more i want you to comfort me
and you know that ain't right.
"and even though, you treat me bad"
i like the treatment that i've had
and you know that ain't right.
so just put yourself in place of me
and i'll push you around
and then you'll see
that ain't the way it ought to be.
but i can't help myself i've tried
i just accept your little white lies
and you know that ain't right.
i said you know that ain't right.
i know you know that ain't right
thunder hit in the midnight sky
wind knockin' them power lines down
tin roof like the fourth of july
like the good lord planned it all out
we ain't gotta light a candle tonight
"girl, i know right where i am"
'cause i know your body like the back of my hand
"like that road that i grew up on, i know every twist and turn"
"we've been doin' this so long, i memorized your every curve"
"girl, don't get me wrong, you're perfect"
from your head down to your toes
"but i can kiss you, i can hold you, i can love you"
i can love you with my eyes closed (with my eyes closed)
"i can love you with my eyes closed, yeah (with my eyes closed)"
"i don't need no moonlight, hell, but go and get that dress undone"
"i know it's pitch black, but hell, might as well be sittin' on the sun"
takin' it nice and slow
"like that road that i grew up on, i know every twist and turn"
"we've been doin' this so long, i memorized your every curve"
"girl, don't get me wrong, you're perfect"
from your head down to your toes
"but i can kiss you, i can hold you, i can love you"
i can love you with my eyes closed (i can love you)
"i can love you with my eyes closed, yeah (i can love you)"
(i can love you)
"if them lights come on, i won't complain (no)"
"'cause i know how to love you either way, yeah"
"like that road that i grew up on, i know every twist and turn"
(i know every twist and turn)
"we've been doin' this so long, i memorized your every curve (every curve)"
"girl, don't get me wrong, you're perfect"
from your head down to your toes
"but i can kiss you, i can hold you, i can love you"
i can love you with my eyes closed (i can love you)
"i can love you with my eyes closed, yeah (i can love you)"
(i can love you with my—)
like the weather your heart changes with each season
springtime summer fall and winter too
though i know i'll never understand the reason
i still wonder why each season changes you
it was springtime when i found you like the flowers
and our love grew warmer with the summer sun
in the fall i could see our love was changing
it broke my heart to see what wintertime had done
like the weather your heart changes...
came the spring again you said that you were sorry
and the summer brought a golden memory
in the fall i saw your love was changing
and the winter brought the same old misery
like the weather your heart changes...
how do you fall in love
when do you say i do
when is the perfect time
to spend the rest of your life
seasons may come and go
and sometimes it rains and snows
and there will be highs and lows
so only you will know
you never know just where it will find you
'cause it can come on you so fast
seems like it takes forever
when you want it so bad
but don't ever take it for granted
'cause it's more than sowing some seeds
it takes sun and water
so give it what it needs
and that's how you fall in love
that's when you say i do
that's when you know it's time
to spend the rest of your life
now seasons may come and go
and sometimes it rains and snows
there will be highs and lows
so only you will know
there will be highs and lows
so only you will know
(it's a crazy world)
now i'm alone starting to cry because my man just said goodbye
he thinks i threw him away even when i begged him to stay
oh oh oh oh oh it's a crazy world
right down the street not very far my man speed find him a bar
he thinks he's got it made but he can't take his troubles away
oh oh oh oh oh it's a crazy world
nothing to him meant something to me
what makes want a prisoner sets another one free
what makes me lonely makes someone else glad
what make me happy does someone else mad
it's a crazy world
you say it's the truth i know it's a lie you tell me hello you mean goodbye
two and two used to make four but i just don't know anymore
oh oh oh oh oh it's a crazy world
it's a crazy world it's a crazy world it's a crazy world
how could you leave me all alone to weep my life away
how could you go you know this town just wouldn't be the same
keep baltimore beautiful stay here by my side
keep baltimore beautiful it wouldn't look so pretty if i cry
the city looks like someone took the sunshine out of town
can't you see me and baltimore are glad when you're around
keep baltimore beautiful...
keep baltimore beautiful...
keep baltimore beautiful...

son she's no lady she's your wife
and i can't remember
how i met her
seems like she's always just been hanging here off my right arm
and i can't remember
how i ever
thought that i just couldn't live without a woman's charm
and even though
she loves the smell of french perfume
and even though
she walks around in high-heel shoes
all i know
is i'm the one who pays her price
man she's no lady she's my wife
and i can't remember
how i met her
seems like she's always just been hanging here off my right arm

sail on country boy sail on by your time has come to shine
all your dreams are on their way
see how they shine if you need a friend i'm sailing right behind
baby let's pretend
we're just kids-seventeen again
don't let anyone know
hold on tight and let's just let it go
this ain't just a kiss we're stealing
let's take our time and chase this feeling
nowhere to be and all night to get there
all night-breathing the same air
real close and real slow baby
just you and me and love laying right here
sunset watching us disappear
we can do anything i don't care
we've got nowhere to be and all
night to get there
secret hideaway
twilight choir in a serenade
the whole world's spinning so fast
let's jump off and let it roll right past us
we can stay this way forever
getting gone-getting lost together
nowhere to be and all night to get there
all night-breathing the same air
real close and real slow baby
just you and me and love laying right here
sunset watching us disappear
we can do anything-i don't care
we've got nowhere to be and all
night to get there
nowhere to be and all night to get there
all night-breathing the same air
real close and real slow baby
just you and me and love laying right here
sunset watching us disappear
we can do anything-i don't care
we've got nowhere to be and all
night to get there
nowhere to be and all night to get there
livin' in the city
ain't never been my idea of gettin' it on
but the job demands that you make new plans
before your big chance is gone.
you get a house in the hills.
you're payin' everyone's bills
and they tell you that you're gonna go far
"but in the back of my mind,"
"i hear it time after time,"
is that who you really are?
"country boy, you got your feet in l.a.,"
but your mind's on tennessee.
"lookin' back, i can remember the time"
when i sang my songs for free.
"country boy, you got your feet in l.a."
take a look at everything you own.
"but now and then, my heart keeps goin' home."
"talkin' on the telephone,"
settin' up another day of people to meet.
"you've gotta do what's right,"
"you've gotta spend the night,"
stayin' in touch with the street.
"when you're surrounded by friends,"
"they say the fun never ends,"
but i guess i'll never figure it out
"'cause in the back of my mind,"
"i hear it time after time,"
is this what it's all about?
"country boy, you got your feet in l.a.,"
but your mind's on tennessee.
"lookin' back, i can remember the time"
when i sang my songs for free.
"country boy, you got your feet in l.a."
take a look at everything you own.
"but now and then, my heart keeps goin' home."
she captured both rock and bird
tied one to the leg of the other
kept them as prisoner
till they knew who was master
then she threw them to the sky
bird with unbarred wings disappeared
rock with weighted heart returned
and rock became her anchor
and bird became her dream
and now she stands on the forest floor
among the pines and towering firs
rock still firm beneath her feet
bird perched high above her
singing songs of love's betrayal
i offered you my endless skies
you countered with hoods and chains
this song i sing will be the last
to be inspired by your memory
(craig bickhardt)
where i used to have a heart
feel like a mile wide ditch
i got a hole inside
the doctor just can't stitch
gone without a trace
you left a hollow place
there's not a stone to mark
where i used to have a heart
there were times when i would
hold you
and feel the pounding in
by chest
now i'm just as empty
as a canyon way out west
that's how deep i love you
"babe, i love you still"
to the bottom of this space
i'll never fill
i guess i'll learn to live with
a different kind of pain
i'm suffering from a sickness
that i cannot give a name
such a strange sensation
i've never felt before
missing you has cut me to the core
where i used to have a heart
way down in bowling green the prettiest girls i've ever seen
a man in kentucky sure is lucky to love down in bowling green
bowling green folks treat you kind better you think your own mind
a man in kentucky sure is lucky in bowling green you walk your own line
kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold
it warms your body and i know it touches the soul
the bluegrass is fine kentucky owns my mind
fields down in bowling green have the softest grass i've ever seen
a man in kentucky sure is lucky to lie down in bowling green
[ strings - dobro ]
kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold...
bowling green girls treat you right they wear dresses cut country tight
a man in kentucky sure is lucky he seen the bowling green night
a man in kentucky well he sure is lucky he seen the bowling green night
a man in kentucky well he sure is lucky he seen the bowling green night
it's funny how love goes
cause i know this could never work out
"but honey, how love grows"
even though there's no reason to doubt
this can never be
you keep saying it's wrong
neither one of us is free
still i want to hold on
when even a fool would let go
cause he knows that there's no use in trying
even a child would say no
when he knows that he'll end up crying
"tell me now, is it wise holdin' you"
even a fool would let go
love has no reason
like the words in a song that don't rhyme
my love has no season
i just know that it's there all the time
maybe just you and me
i can't believe that it's wrong
thinking about you and me
just makes me want to hold on
"tell me now, is it wise holdin' you"
when even a fool would let go
she may not be the girl that i'll marry
but we still get together sometimes
i'll admit i don't like what she stands for
but she loves me right out of my mind
i'm looking for someone who's gentle
and someone who's so sweet and kind
but she sure feels devoid when i'm lonesome
and she loves me right out of my mind
she never claimed to be an angel and an angel she'll never be
but when we're alone and i hold her she brings out the devil in me
when i look into her eyes i see a woman
and even if she's not my kind
she's got something i need so i'll take it
and let her love me right out of my mind
she's the best thing the world has to offer
and she loves me right out of my mind
out of all the reindeers
you know you're the mastermind

yeah..
in the circles i've been running
i've covered many miles
but i could search forever
for what's right before my eyes
just when i thought i found me
it was nothing like i planned
but when i got my heart around it
it slipped right though my hands
here with you i feel it
i close my eyes and see it
"in a midnight talk, in a morning kiss"
when i'm in your arms
that's where it is!
when we tangle up and can't resist
when we feel that rush
that's where it is!
that's where it is..
when i'm crashing though the madness
not sure who i'm supposed to be
when i'm caught up in the darkness
it's you're hand that's leading me
you bring me back to solid ground
"you lift me up right here, right now!"
it's a lifetime filled with tiny faces
the biggest things in the smallest places!
"in the sweetest smile, on a night like this"
with a tender touch
that's where it is!
when we're tangled up
and can't resist
when we feel that rush
that's where it is!
that's where it is..
"i've been telling you there's someone else, virginia."
your not listening and this time i think you should.
"but, you've never cared for me, have you virginia?"

"yes, virginia. there is another woman."
and she loves me like i used to wish you'd do.
"yes, virginia. there is another woman."
now i need her more than i ever needed you.
i have never measured up to what you wanted.
"i'm through trying now i know, i never can."
"that's the reason why i love her so, virginia."
she accepts me just exactly like i am.
"yes, virginia. there is another woman."
and she loves me like i used to wish you'd do.
"yes, virginia. there is another woman."
"now, i need her more than i ever needed you."
"yes, virginia. there is another woman."
"now, i need her more than i ever needed you..."

two days later papa passed away and i became a man that so i told mam i was gonns quit school but she said that was daddies stricktest rule.
"so every mornin before i when to school i fed the chickens and i copped wood too, some times i felt that i couldn't go on i wnted to leave just run away from home but i would remember what my daddy said with his hand on ma shoulders and tears he said he said patches im depending on ya son ive tried to do my best its up to you to do the rest."
then one day a strong rain came and washed all the crops away and at the age of thirteen i thought i was carring the waite of the whole world on my shoulders and you know mamma knew what i was going through cause evey day i had to work the feilds cause thats the only way we got our meals you see i was the oldest of the family and everybody was depending on me every night i heard my mamma pray lord give hime strength to make another day.
"though the years have passed and all the kids have grown the angels took mamma to a brand new lord knows people i,ve shed some tears but my daddies voice kept ringing through the my ears saying patches i'm depending on ya son to pull the family through now son its all left up to you."
patches i tried to my best its up to you to do the rest
"oh, i love her and just can't live without her"
and i've got the urge to tell the world about her
but our love's a secret and can't see the light of day
but i went and wrote this love song anyway
"her name is _ _ _, her eyes are _"
"her hair is just like _ _, and she measures _ _ _"
but someday i'll fill in the lines when she and i are free
and we'll walk in the sunshine _ _ _ and me
--- instrumental ---
"oh, it really is a scandal and disgrace"
to have to call your woman what's-her-face
but her husband thinks he owns her heart and soul for life
and he'll kill the man who messes with his wife
"her name is _ _ _, her eyes are _"
"her hair is just like _ _, and she measures _ _ _"
but someday i'll fill in the lines when she and i are free
and we'll walk in the sunshine _ _ _ and me
"yes, someday i'll fill in the lines when she and i are free"
and we'll walk in the sunshine _ _ _ and me
her name is _ _ _...
remember how lonely i told you it would be
without you here with me
but you just turned and walked away
and now that i've found somebody new
you've changed your tune
you want me back but all i can say
it's too late now
just tell me how long did you think
i'd be your fool
and i would sit right here an' wait
for you to make up
your mind to show up
"well, just turn around"
i'm sorry it's too late now
well didn't i tell you that one of these days
it would be too late
to say you'd made a big mistake
and now you've come back like you've never been gone
well baby you're wrong
somebody else has taken your place
well i ain't never been an angel
i ain't never been called a saint
"yeah, i've decorated every bar in town"
with a big red coat of paint
but good thing i had a good raisin'
for all the hell i've raised since then
when that roll is called up yonder
i know they've gonna let me in
'cause jesus got a tight grip on my soul
"and he ain't letting go, he ain't letting go"
the devil reaches out but he can't grab hold
'cause jesus got a tight grip on my soul
"and he ain't letting go, he ain't letting go"
might have a little rust on my halo
but when i'm gone i know where i'll go
'cause jesus got a tight grip on my soul
now i've been a little more cold beer
"than holy water, it's true"
more saturday night on an old bar stool
than a sunday morning pew
but even old hank williams
finally saw the light
"and, oh hallelujah, i have too"
and it ain't just the neon kind
'cause jesus got a tight grip on my soul
"and he ain't letting go, he ain't letting go"
the devil reaches out but he can't grab hold
'cause jesus got a tight grip on my soul
"and he ain't letting go, he ain't letting go"
might have a little rust on my halo
but when i'm gone i know where i'll go
"'cause jesus got a tight grip on my soul, yeah"
"jesus got a tight grip on my soul, yeah"
"whoa, i got a long, long way to go"
"whoa, but i'm gonna get there i know"
'cause jesus got a tight grip on my soul
"and he ain't letting go, he ain't letting go"
the devil reaches out but he can't grab hold
'cause jesus got a tight grip on my soul
"and he ain't letting go, he ain't letting go"
might have a little rust on my halo
but when i'm gone i know where i'll go
'cause jesus got a tight grip on my soul
jesus got a tight grip on my soul
"yeah he does, and he ain't letting go"
i wasted my tears
when i cried over you
i wasted my tears
when i cried over you
i should've known
you would never be true
i loved and i lost you
now i'm so blue
i wasted my tears
when i cried over you
you said that you loved me
and would always be true
now you gone'n left me
"oh, what will i do"
"oh, why did you leave me"
for somebody new
i wasted my tears
when i cried over you
i wasted my time
when i spent it with you
but one is so blind
when love is so new
now out of my fears have come true
i wasted my tears
when i cried over you
i wasted my tears
when i cried over you
well tonight when you lay lonely in your king size bed
with a hunger inside you can feel
i'll be the empty spot laying next to you
and when your phone don't ring it'll be me
it'll be me not calling you crying like i used to do
crawling on my hands and knees
it'll be me not on the phone begging let me come back home
and when your phone don't ring it'll be me
well tonight it'll be my car not in your driveway
and you'll wonder where on earth i could be
it'll be my footsteps you don't hear in your hallway
and when your phone don't ring it'll be me
it'll be me not calling you crying like i used to do...
[ guitar ]
oh it'll be me not calling you crying like i used to do...
yes when your phone don't ring it'll be me
if i had just one tear
running down your cheek
maybe i could cope maybe i'd get some sleep
if i had just one moment at your expense
maybe all my misery would be well spent
could you cry a little
lie just a little
pretend that you're feeling a little more pain
i gave now i'm wanting
something in return
so cry just a little for me
"if your love could be caged, honey"
i would hold the key
and conceal it underneath that pile of lies
you handed me
and you'd hunt and those lies
they'd be all you'd ever find
and that'd be all you'd have to know
for me to be fine
and you'd cry a little
you'd die just a little
and baby i would feel just a little less pain
i gave now from wanting
something in return
so cry just a little for me
"give it up, baby"
i hear you're doing fine
nothing's gonna save me
i can see it in your eyes
some kind of heartache
"honey, give it a try"
i don't want pity
i just want what is mine
could you cry a little
lie just a little
pretend that you're feeling a little more pain
i gave now i'm wanting
something in return
"so cry just a little for me, yeah"
cry just a little for me
could you cry a little for me...

i'd be ridin' in a cab goin' downtown
findin' faces i know in a big crowd
"tryin' to drink the pain away, mhmm"
"and i'd be stayin' out all night, never goin' home"
girl you know i'd lose all control
if i lost you
there would be a riot
"breakin' of my heart, i'd try to fight it"
i could go out every night but i'd be lyin'
if i said i could live and breathe
without you
there'd be a lot of lonely
wishin' and prayin' that you would hold me
i would do most anything baby
if only you would come back to me
come back to me
there would be a riot
"oh yeah, ooh"
i'd be checkin' on my phone every minute
waitin' 'round for it to start ringin'
and prayin' it would be you

there would be a riot
"breakin' of my heart, i'd try to fight it"
i could go out every night but i'd be lyin'

"fresh scrubbed baby, momma's kiss on his cheek"
steps off the greyhound with money for a week.
"a wild eyed innoncent, he knows no fear"
it takes more than heroes to survive down there.
"in the badlands, the badlands, the badlands"
well if you've got the bullets...
they'll remember your name down there.
"can't drink the water, can't breathe the air"
"they said it was exciting, never said it was fair"
you're just another singer in a pilgrim's suit
chased by the lines till you learn to shoot
"in the badlands, the badlands, the badlands"
if you've got those black diamonds
they'll remember your name down there.
"badlands, well there's always a faster hand in the west"
room around town for only the best
one false step and you'll be cut down
"for some it's paradise, others it's hell."
"in the badlands, the badlands, the badlands"
"yeah, if you've got the bullet"
they'll remember your name down there.
they'll remember your name down there.
they'll remember your name down there.
you're gonna need some protection.
you had better make your connections.
the cold december wind seems bent on rockin' new york city
the town that's got me down to my last dime
"and everywhere i go, the people seem in such a hurry"
to keep this mobile girl from feelin' fine
"lord, what i'd give to see an alabama sundown"
the sun just seemed to drop in mobile bay
new york town has got a gifted way to keep a girl down
"but that never was the mobile way, no, no"
that never was the mobile way
a flashing sign says that you can rent a bed for just a dollar
"in anybody's town, that price is cheap"
it's a shame to know a girl would ever fall down to my standards
'cause i need ninety cents to go to sleep
i felt so big the day i left that mobile couldn't hold me
i thought there had to be a better way
but if i could find that man that first called lady luck a lady
that gentleman would surely learn to pray
"where there's a cloud, don't mean there's rain"
"tears in my eyes, don't mean there's pain"
"don't flatter yourself, i'm over you"
things aren't always what they seem
you can't believe everythin' you read
"on my face, i'm over you"
you heard i'm drinkin' more than i should
that i ain't been lookin' all that good
someone told you i was takin' it a rough
why they makin' those stories up
when i'm over you
there were times if you'd been around
you'd only see me broken down
"but now you won't, i'm over you"
so if i seem a little bit cold
it only means you've lost the hold
"you had on me, i'm over you"
you heard i'm drinkin' more than i should
that i ain't been lookin' all that good
someone told you i was takin' it a rough
but why they makin' those stories up
when i'm over you
you heard i'm drinkin' more than i should
that i ain't been lookin' all that good
someone told you i was takin' it a rough
why they makin' those stories up
when i'm over you
yeah i'm over you
i'm over you
[miley]
ooooo
yeah
i didn't wanna listen to what you were sayin'
i thought that i knew all i need to know
i didn't realize that somewhere inside me
i knew you were right but i couldn't say so
"i can take care of myself, yeah, you taught me well"
i learned from you that i do not crumble
i learned that strength is something you choose
all of the reasons to keep on believin'
"there's no question, that's a lesson, that i learned from you"
[billy ray]
we always don't agree on
what is the best way
to get to the place that we're going from here
"but i can really trust you, and give you the distance,"
to make your decisions without any fear
[both]
i'm grateful for all of the times
you opened my eyes
i learned from you that i do not crumble
i learned that strength is something you choose
"all of the reasons to keep on believin',"
"there's no question, that's a lesson"
i learned from you
[both]
you taught me to stand on my own
[miley] and i thank you for that
[both]
"it saved me, it made me,"
and now that i'm looking back
[miley] i can say
[both] woooaaahhhh!
[miley] hmmmm... hmmmm... yeah!
[both]
i learned from you that
[miley] i learned from you
[both]
i do not crumble
i learned that strength is something you choose
[miley] something you choose
[both]
"all of the reasons to keep on believin',"
[miley] keep on believin'
"there's no question, that's a lesson that i learned from you"
[miley]
woooaaahhhh!
i learned from yoooouuu
i learned that strength is something you choose
[billy ray] something you choose
[both]
"all of the reasons to keep on believin',"
"there's no question, that's a lesson that i learned from you"
[miley] yeah!
[both]
i learned from you
i can hear the wind a blowing in my mind
just the way it used to sound through the georgia pines
and you were there to answer
when i called you and me we had it all
remember how i used to touch your hair
while reaching for the feeling that was always there
you were the best thing in my life
i can recall you and me we had it all
i know that we can never live those times again
so i let my dreams take me back to where we have been
then i'll stay with you girl as long as i can
oh it was so good oh it was so good
oh it was so good when i was your man
i'll never stop believing in your smile
even though you didn't stay it was all worth while
you were the best thing in my life
i can recall you and me we had it all
you and me we had it all
sting of the needle dropping on a vinyl
neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
"33, 45, 78"
when it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
another vice
all dressed up in a pretty black label
sweet salvation on a dining room table
waiting on me
where the numb meets the lonely
it's gone before it ever melts the ice
"another vice, another call"
another bed i shouldn't crawl out of
at 7 am with shoes in my hand
"said i wouldn't do it, but i did it again"
"and i know i'll be back tomorrow night, oh"
i'll wear a town like a leather jacket
"when the new wears off, i don't even pack it"
if you need me
i'll be where my reputation don't precede me
maybe i'm addicted to goodbyes
"another vice, another town"
where my past can't run me down
"another life, another call"
another bed i shouldn't crawl out of
at 7 am with shoes in my hand
"said i wouldn't do it, but i did it again"
and i know i'll be gone tomorrow night
"mmm, another vice"
"standing at the sink, not looking in the mirror"
don't know where i am or how i got here
well the only thing that i know how to find
is another vice
"mmm, another vice"
is another vice
"ooh, another vice"
another vice
another vice
another vice
"without a song, the day would never end"
"without a song, the road would never bend"
when things go wrong a man ain't got a friend
without a song
that field of corn would never see a plough
that field of corn would be deserted now
"a man is born, but he is no good no how"
without a song
"i've got my trouble and woe, but sure as i know"
the jordan will roll
i'll get along as long as a song is strung
in my soul
i'll never know what makes the rain to fall
i'll never know what makes the grass so tall
i only know there ain't no love at all
without a song
"i got my trouble and woe, but sure as i know"
the jordan will roll
i'll get along as long as a song is strung
in my soul
i'll never know what makes the rain to fall
i'll never know what makes the grass so tall
i only know there ain't no love at all
without a song
"oh, there's a river that winds on forever"
i'm gonna see where it leads
"oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted"
i'm gonna stand on the peak
out there's a land that time don't command
wanna be the first to arrive
no time for ponderin' why i'm a-wanderin'
not while we're both still alive
to the ends of the earth would you follow me?
there's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
to the ends of the earth would you follow me?
if you won't i must say my goodbyes to thee
"oh, there's an island where all things are silent"
i'm gonna whistle a tune
"oh, there's a desert that size can't be measured"
i'm gonna count all the dunes
"out there's a world that calls for me, girl"
headin' out into the unknown
wayfarin' strangers and all kinds of danger
please don't say i'm going alone
to the ends of the earth would you follow me?
there's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
to the ends of the earth would you follow me?
if you won't i must say my goodbyes to me
"i was a-ready to die for you, baby"
doesn't mean i'm ready to stay
what good is livin' a life you've been given
if all you do is stand in one place
i'm on a river that winds on forever
follow 'til i get where i'm goin'
maybe i'm headin' to die but i'm still gonna try
i guess i'm goin' alone
"there's a place that they call ""heaven"""
just south of town way up on a hill
they say you can see for miles
"when the sun goes down, time stands still"
"no i've never been up to ""heaven"""
but i've always wanted to go
it's ten miles down highway eleven
and ten more minutes up the old dirt road

and have you back by tonight
"there's a place that they call ""heaven"""
just south of town way up on a hill
they say you can see for miles
"when the sun goes down, time stands still"
"you better sit down kids, i'll tell you why, kids"
"you might not understand, kids, but give it a try, kids"
"now how should i put this, i've got something to say"
"your mama is staying, but i'm goin' away"
"no, we're not mad, kids, and it's hard to say why"
"your mother and i, kids, don't see eye to eye"
say your prayers before you go to bed
make sure you get yourself to school on time
i know you'll do the things your mother asks
she's gonna need you most to stay in line
keep in mind your mama's gonna need
your help a whole lot more than she ever did before
no more fightin' over little things 'cause
i won't be here to stop them anymore
"i know you don't want this, but neither do we"
"but sometimes things happen, that we can't foresee"
"so try to be calm, kids, and don't look so sad"
"just cause i am leavin', i'll still be your dad"
"but just remember i love you, and though i'm not here"
"just call if you need me, i'll always be near"

"well, i have to go now, so kiss me goodbye"
"my eyes are just red, kids, i'm too big to cry"
i wrote the book on self preservation
and i'm a firm believer in my piece of mind
but lately i've been looking back a little too much of the time
and you know what i see that i'm losing control of me
i took a good look at the situation
and i'm committed now though i know it's wrong
'cause when it comes to loving you
i never stop singing that song
"i'm trying to say, i can't let common"
sense get in the way 'cause
i'm making my comeback by going straight back to you

old stuff starts flying again
"i'm making my comeback, well, i'm making my first debut"
"'cause i wanna be a star, i just wanna"
be a star like you made me then
there is no joy in self destruction
i did better off leaving the past alone
the dirty dishes keep telling me
i'm not sure thing on my own
but it's better to be unhappy in your company so
"i'm making my comeback, girl"
i'm going straight back to you

five o'clock 500
alabama
album: for the record

walkin' out the door a-headin' home
it's time to buckle up again
in my rolling hunk of tin
it's quittin' time the evenin' race is on
it's that five o'clock 500 and i run it every day
"pick-up trucks, cars and buses all in my way"
"we've got darrel, we've got dale,"

"oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way"
it's that five o'clock 500 every day
"oh, bubba's runnin' right on my bumper"
pushin' me but there's no where to go
lane changin' left and right
blowin' horns and blinkin' lights
"oh, the fast lane has never been so slow"
it's that five o'clock 500 and i run it every day
"pick-up trucks, cars and buses all in my way"
"we've got darrel, we've got dale,"
"richard, mark, rusty and jeff"
"oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way"
it's that five o'clock 500 every day
well the caution is out we're at a stand-still

"pick-up trucks, cars and buses all in my way"
"we've got darrel, we've got dale,"
"richard, mark, rusty and jared"

"it's that five o'clock 500, five o'clock 500,"
five o'clock 500 every day
there is no love and there is no hate there is no feeling at all
i look at you and you look at me but we might as well stare at the wall
cause you don't see me and i don't see you just the shadow of love that is gone
there is no love and there is no hate no reason to hurry home
there's no tiny hands to reach out to us no plans bein' made anymore
we have no tomorrow our future is gone there is only sadness in store
we don't care enough to even ask questions
and when we're together we still feel alone
there is no love and there is no hate no reason to hurry home
there is nothing to look forward to no reason to hurry home
somewhere a river of happiness flows
we'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow
somewhere there's a garden where only love grows
somewhere a river of happiness flows
"dry your eyes, don't cry no more"
we'll find a place where there's laughter and joy
so take my hand and don't let go
come with me and together we'll go
we'll walk in the sunshine
we'll laugh and we'll sing
and dance to the tune that our happiness brings
come go with me to this place i speak of
"together, we'll find it, this place is called love"
tag:
somewhere a river of happiness flows
there's a lot of ways of saying what i want to say to you
there's songs and poems and promises and dreams that might come true
but i won't talk of starry skies or moonlight on the ground
i'll come right out and tell you i'd just love to lay you down
lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
i'll let you know how much it means just having you around
oh darlin' how i'd love to lay you down
there's so many ways your sweet love made this house into a home
you've got a way of doing little things that turn me on
like standing in the kitchen in your faded cotton gown
with your hair still up in curlers i still love to lay you down
lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
i'll let you know how much it means just having you around
oh darlin' how i'd love to lay you down
when a whole lot of decembers are showin' in your face
your auburn hair has faded and silver takes it's place
you'll be just as lovely and i'll still be around
and if i can i know that i'd still love to lay you down
lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
i'll let you know how much it means just having you around
oh darlin' how i'd love to lay you down
lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
i'll let you know how much it means just having you around
oh darlin' how i'd love to lay you down
lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
i'll let you know how much it means just having you around
oh darlin' how i'd love to lay you down
you say your heart's been broken
and you just can't win
you say that you'll never love again
let me tell you friend
you can't give up on love
that's the one thing we've got to keep going
'cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
but you can't give up on love
looked out my window and what did i see
it's another broken family
the kids are stayin' with mama at home
daddy's livin' in a house all alone
you can't give up on love
that's the one thing we've got to keep going
'cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
but you can't give up on love
troubled times make it hard to stay
so many lovers take the easy way
but don't go crazy and jump ship too soon
'cause every day can't be a honeymoon
you can't give up on love
that's the one thing we've got to keep going
'cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
but you can't give up on love
"no, you can't give up on love"
"oh, you can't give up on love"
dr. robert f. thomas
may his name forever stand
dr. robert f. thomas
"was a mighty, mighty man"
and he enriched the lives
of everyone that ever knew him
and in my song i hope to sing
some of the praise that's due him
dr. thomas was a man
the lord must have appointed
to live among us mountain folks
in eastern tennessee
and he delivered more than half
the babies in those mountains
among those babies
he delivered me
there was no way to drive along
the roads back in those mountains
but dr. thomas got there
just the same
he often rode on horseback
to get where he was needed
but if he had to walk
he always came
dr. thomas was a friend
a neighbor and a doctor
though he seldom got a dime
for all he'd done
and i remember lots of times
we sent for dr. thomas
but i don't recall a time
he didn't come
they say a man is judged
by the deeds he does while livin'
a judgement when he stands
before the lord
and i know heaven holds a place
for men like dr. thomas
and i know that he'll receive
his just reward
i'm looking at a star
wondering where you are
lonely in love
looking at the sky
start to wonder my love
how long i'm going to burn
with this same old flame
i miss you all the time
ain't unhappy
but i'm lonely in love
i know i didn't treat you right
scared you into flight
lonely in love
never acted wise
couldn't organize love
but these longings return
when i hear your name
i let you go and now
i can't forget somehow
i'm lonely in love
i'm young in the daylight
with a pocket full of money
ladies to the left
and to the right
but when night time comes
i'm a star watcher honey
i can't get along
on light bulb light
so i'm looking at a star
wondering where you are
lonely in love
looking at the sky
start to wonder my love
how long i'm going to play
in this rained out game
it don't make any sense
but honey be convinced
i'm lonely in love
if you think i've second guessed it
or for one minute i'd regret it
this life with you
"no, there's never been a moment"
not one time i haven't known it
what i have with you
you hold my heart
deep inside of every single part
if i could be anything
"i wish that i could be, oh baby"
if i could rule all the kingdoms
maybe even sail the seven seas
if i could do all the things
i only dream that i could do
i'd still be
the man in love with you
i try every day to show it
just to make sure that you know it
i'm here to stay
and you'll never have a reason
to ever think i'm leaving
there's just no way
it's no mystery
how i feel
"baby, can't you see"
i can't go places
i always see traces
of the only thing in life i'll ever need
if i could do all the things
i only dream that i could do
i'd still be
the man in love with you
i'd still be
the man in love with you
"writers charles l. seitz, joe lewis, elmar rader"
i thought i had seen pretty girls in my time that was before i met you
i never saw one that i wanted for mine that was before i met you
i thought i was swinging the world by the tail i thought i could never be blue
i thought i'd been kissed and i thought i'd been loved but that was before i
met you
i thought i'd stay single and always be free but that was before i met you
and i said that no sweet thing could ever hold me but that was before i met you
i thought i was swinging...
i thought i was swinging...
that was before i met you
everybody waitin' for the weekend
gettin' off five in the p. m
wanna blow off a little steam and
go cut a-loose somewhere
folks start showin' up at seven
order up a crown or a cold one
nobody buyin' rounds for no one
no girls dancin' on the bar in there
but in the a. m
they go from gettin' buzzed into wasted
might not remember what they're sayin'
radio turned up and playin' loud a honky tonk station
spendin' what they spent the week makin'
ask a little hottie what her name is
the whole worlds a-sleepin'
we're wide awake in the a. m
leave around ten and you're alright
"everybody's cool, never uptight"
but if you stay longer than midnight
you might end up in the middle of a fist fight
cause in the a. m
they go from gettin' buzzed into wasted
might not remember what they're sayin'
radio turned up and playin' loud a honky tonk station
spendin' what ya spent the week makin'
ask a little hottie what her name is
the whole world's a-sleepin
we're wide awake in the a. m
in the a. m
they go from gettin' buzzed into wasted
might not remember what they're sayin'
radio turned up and playin' loud a honky tonk station
spendin' what ya spent the week makin'
ask a little hottie what her name is
"hey baby, tell me, what ya think about gettin' out of this place and"
let me show you my chevrolet and
we can sit and do a little star-gazin'
get a little bit of a long time in
in the a. m
"ay-yeah, in the a. m"
ha!
sing the wondrous love of jesus;
sing his mercy and his grace.
in the mansions bright and blessed
he'll prepare for us a place.
[refrain:]
"when we all get to heaven,"
what a day of rejoicing that will be!
"when we all see jesus,"
we'll sing and shout the victory!
onward to the prize before us!
soon his beauty we'll behold;
soon the pearly gates will open;
we shall tread the streets of gold.
[refrain]
i'm crazy
crazy for feeling so lonely
i'm crazy
crazy for feeling so blue
i know
you'd love me as long as you wanted
then someday
leave me for somebody new
worry
why do i let myself worry
wondring
what in the world did i do
crazy
for thinking that my love could hold you
i'm crazy for trying
i'm crazy for crying
i'm crazy for loving you
i lost my mind the day i lost your love
i lost everything except the will to cry
if you find me crawling back from time to time
"it's not you i want, i'm lookin' for my mind"
'cause i lost my mind the day i lost your love
i'm not crazy but sometimes i wish i was
if you turn around and find me crawling close behind
"it's not you i want, i'm lookin' for my mind"
'cause i lost my mind the day i lost your love
i'm not crazy but sometimes i wish i was
if you turn around and find me crawling close behind
"it's not you i want, i'm lookin' for my mind"
"it's not you i want, i'm lookin' for my mind"

you're standing much too close to me again
i've never once touched you but in my mind i've already sinned
you're making it hard for me to be true i don't trust me around you
seems like every place i go i'll see you there
i can't keep my eyes off you i just stand and stare
you tempt me more than anyone i ever knew i don't trust me around you
i don't trust me around you i belong to someone else not once have i been untrue
but when i'm close to you this way i find myself want it to
i don't trust me around you
i don't trust me...
no i don't trust me around you
was it that long ago
i was skipping school with a lunchbox
pigtails in my hair
where did the time go
one minute i'm playing in the sandbox
how'd i get to here from there
making lunches and folding clothes
it's not the most glamourous life i know
but i've got so much more than most
i'm not famous but my kids think i'm a star
im not rich but i've made a million memories so far
i may not be a model
but my man thinks i could be
i may not be from royalty
but in these four walls
i'm the queen
i had it all planned
first i'd make it big in nashville
then take hollywood by storm
but it was in god's hands
there were three little lives that would need me
to one day be their mom
i wouldn't trade it for anything
those movie stars don't have everything
i know i'm right where i wanna be
"i had to let it go, but i have no regrets"
i would have never known this kind of happiness
front porch light would be turned on
and i was always gone too long
curfew was at 10pm
and i'd sneak in trying not to wake him when i got
home
daddy always said son your half a bubble off plumb
"head-strong and stubborn, and maybe i was"
"yeah, i couldn't wait to leave"
last place in the world i wanted to be was
home
now i'm flying down that old dirt road
but it seems these wheels are spinning slow
i'd never left that way if i'd have only known
"but he's gone, so here i am"
home
i sat in my car and cried
wished to god he was still alive
"inside, mama wiped my tears"
"she said, he would have been so happy that you're here"
at home
then i thought about my life
and about my kids and about my wife
and about how time just flies no matter what you do
and every soccer game i have missed
and every time i fight when i could forgive
and how i can't let it come to this
when i get home
now i'm flying down that old dirt road
but it seems these wheels are spinning slow
and it's taken me awhile but now i finally know
everything that matters most is at
home
why does the sun go on shining?
why does the sea rush to shore?
don't they know it's the end of the world?
'cause you don't love me anymore...
why do the birds go on singing?
why do the stars glow above?
don't they know its the end of the world?
it ended when i lost your love.....
"i wake up in the morning and i wonder,"
why everything's the same as it was.....
"i can't understand, no- i can't understand,"
how life goes on the way it does....
why does my heart go on beating?
why do these eyes of mine cry?
don't they know it's the end of the world?
it ended when you said: good bye.
why does my heart go on beating?
why do these eyes of mine cry?
don't they know it's the end of the world?
it ended when you said: good-bye........
everybody wants to find a love
"somebody, somebody who will always care"
we get locked up in our own worlds
with feelings and secrets we're afraid to share
but all i have to do is see you smile
"and maybe, just maybe if i brush your hand"
something happens i cannot explain
"and somehow, oh somehow i can understand"
"i, i think you're gonna find"
gonna find you
gonna find you
i'm reading your mind
i know you by heart
and you're so much a part of me
"i know you by heart, yes i do"
it's no wonder i can love you the way that i do
i can finish any sentence you start
"i know you, i know you by heart"
i know everytime you're gonna call
i pick up the phone before it ever rings
and when you need some lovin' i'll be there
beside you anticipating everything
oh it's like i always said
you're the one i want
all i want is you
i'm inside your head
i know you by heart
"girl, you're so much a part of me"
"i know you by heart, yes i do"
it's no wonder i can love you the way that i do
i can finish any sentence you start
"i know you, i know you by heart"
it's no wonder i can love you the way that i do
i can finish any sentence you start
"i know you, i know you by heart"
i know you by heart
and you're so much a part of me
"i know you by heart, i know you, i know you, i know you"
it's no wonder i can love you the way that i do
i can finish any sentence you start
"i know you, i know you by"
tonight down here in the valley i'm lonesome and oh how i feel
as i sit here alone in my cabin i can see your mansion on the hill
do you recall when we parted the story to me you revealed
you said you could live without love dear in your loveless mansion on the hill
[ fiddle ]
i've waited all through the years love to give you a heart true and real
cause i know you're living in sorrow in your loveless mansion on the hill
the light shines bright from your window the trees stand so silent and still
and i know you're alone with your pride dear in your loveless mansion on the hill
(stephanie davis)
in waters calm i sailed from shore
to see what i might see
and having never sailed before
i drifted aimlessly
a warm breeze rocked my boat until
in slumber i fell sound
but woke to find the light grown dim
and dark clouds gathering 'round
in haste i worked at turning back
but now the wind blew wrong
and when the night came cold and black
my strength was almost gone
but with one last small thread of hope
i bowed my head to pray
then through the dark i saw a rope
and heard a calm voice say
grab the rope
hold it tight
in the distance
shines a light
neither fear
nor feel alone
there is one
who'll lead you home
i heard my heart beat loud and fast
but did as i was told
and with the rosey dawn at last
dry land i did behold
i kissed the sandy banks and swore
my sailing days were through
but should i ever stray from shore
i know now what to do
grab the rope
hold it tight
in the distance
shines a light
neither fear
nor feel alone
there is one
who'll lead you home
grab the rope
hold it tight
in the distance
shines a light
neither fear
nor feel alone
there is one
saw your picture in the paper and i see you've married good
and i know that he can give you all the things i never could
but i know that he can't give you what you need most of all
so the door is always open and the light's on in the hall
yes the door is always open and the light's on in the hall
and you know that i'll be waiting if you'd ever come to call
[ guitar ]
when night falls on that mansion and you're lying in his bed
when he begs for your attention will you think of me instead
when he reaches out to touch you is your face turned to the wall
well the door is always open and the light's on in the hall
yes the door is always open...
"well when i woke up this mornin',"
"there was a note upon my door,"
"said don't make me no coffee babe,"
"'cause i won't be back no more,"
"and that's all she wrote, dear john,"
i've sent your saddle home.
"now jonah got along in the belly of the whale,"
"daniel in the lion's den,"
"but i know a guy that didn't try to get along,"
"and he won't get a chance again,"
"and that's all she wrote, dear john,"
i've fetched your saddle home.
"well she didn't forward no address,"
"nor she didn't say goodbye,"
"all she said was if you get blue,"
"just hang your little head and cry,"
"and that's all she wrote, dear john,"
i've sent your saddle home.
"now my gal's short and stubby,"
"she's strong as she can be,"
"but if that little old gal of mine,"
"ever get's a-hold of me,"
"that's all she wrote, dear john,"
i've sent your saddle home.
"now jonah got along in the belly of the whale,"
"daniel in the lion's den,"
"but i know a man that didn't try to get along,"
"and he won't get a chance again,"
"and that's all she wrote, dear john,"
i've fetched your saddle home.
"now i went down to the bank this morning,"
"the cashier said with a grin,"
"i feel so sorry for you hank,"
"but your wife has done been in,"
"and that's all she wrote, dear john,"
i've sent your saddle home.
(mary sharon rice/bill rice)
love i haven't seen you in a long time
since then i ain't been worth a dime
hasn't been that long
but it feels like years
last time it could have worked out better
but you know we belong together
love don't be a stranger round here
you know your way around my heart
but i know you don't see well in the dark
so i leave a light on and you won't get scared
in the morning or even at midnight
you can come on in its all right
love don't be a stranger
don't worry bout the danger
love don't be a stranger round here
last time you went away
"you made me cry, cry, cry"
said i didn't need you anyway
"but i lied, lied, lied"
love don't be a stranger
don't worry bout the danger
love don't be a stranger round here
love i'm a little bit smarter
and i'll try a little bit
this time i won't wind up in tears
love now that we're talking
maybe you'll come around more often
love don't be a stranger
don't worry about the danger
don't be a stranger round
last time you went away
"you made me cry, cry, cry"
said i didn't need you anyway
"but i lied, lied, lied"
love don't be a stranger
don't worry bout the danger
well it must've been 100 in that summer sun
and i've been in it all day
putting up with that prick of an owner's son
making me some hillbilly pay
"working right through lunch, busting my hump"
helping his daddy stay rich
so when he kept me behind to pull some overtime
i told that little son of a bitch
"hey i've been punching your clock, giving all i got"
putting up with your pain in the rear
"adios, i'm done, you can find me son"
between a hottie and an ice cold beer
hey i've been breaking my hump but it's never enough
ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
hey but lucky for me you can easily see
i still got a finger that works
yea i've been dragging home almost every night
'bout the time that you're going out
wearing something way too short and tight
leaving me and the dog on a couch
"yea, now word's getting round you've been sneaking downtown"
dancing way too risky
well i got a few dirty dance moves too
and a cute little one finger wave
"hey i've been punching your clock, giving all i got"
putting up with your pain in the rear
"adios, i'm done, you can find me hun"
between a hottie and an ice cold beer
hey i've been breaking my hump but it's never enough
ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
hey but lucky for me you can easily see
i still got a finger that works
here it comes
"hey i've been punching your clock, giving all i got"
putting up with your pain in the rear
"adios, i'm done, you can find me hun"
between a hottie and an ice cold beer
"hey i've been busting my ass, you don't care about that"
ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
hey but lucky for me you can easily see
i still got a finger that works
oh yea
woo!
yes i do
look at that thing
"you know you're number one, baby"
"you must've a been in a place so dark, couldn't feel the light"
reachin' for you through that stormy cloud
now here we are gathered in our little home town
this can't be the way you meant to draw a crowd
"oh why, that's what i keep askin'"
was there anything i could have said or done
"oh i, had no clue you were masking a troubled soul, god only knows"
"what went wrong, and why you'd leave the stage in the middle of a song"
now in my mind i keep you frozen as a seventeen year old
roundin' third to score that winning run
you always played with passion no matter what the game
when you took the stage you shined just like the sun
"oh why, that's what i keep askin'"
was there anything i could have said or done
"oh i, had no clue you were masking a troubled soul, god only knows"
"what went wrong, and why you'd leave the stage in the middle of a song"
"yeah, yeah, yeah"
now the oak trees are swayin' in the early autumn breeze
the golden sun is shining on my face
the tangled thoughts i hear a mockingbird sing
this old world really ain't that bad a place
oh why there's no comprehending
and who am i to try to judge or explain
"oh, but i do have one burning question"
who told you life wasn't worth the fight
they were wrong
they lied
and now you're gone
and we cried
"'cause it's not like you, to walk away in the middle of a song"
your beautiful song
your absolutely beautiful song
the bottle is almost empty the clock just now struck ten
darling i had to call you to our favorite place again
we know it's wrong for us to meet
but the fire's gone out at home
there's nothing cold as ashes after the fire is gone
"love is where you find it, when you find no love at home"
"and there's nothing cold as ashes, after the fire is gone"
your lips are warm and tender your arms hold me just right
sweet words of love you remember
that the one at home forgot
each time we say it's last time but we keep hanging on
and there's nothing cold as ashes after the fire is gone
"love is where you find it, when you find no love at home"
"and there's nothing cold as ashes, after the fire is gone"
"and there's nothing cold as ashes, after the fire is gone"
words and music by randy owen
whisper to me softly three words upon my skin.
"no one's near and listenin', so please don't say goodbye."
just hold me close and love me.
press your lips to mine.
"mm, feels so right, feels so right."
"lying here beside you, i hear the echoes of your sighs."
promise me you'll stay with me and keep warm tonight.
so hold me close and love me.
give my heart a smile.
"mm, feels so right, feels so right."
your body feels so gentle and my passion rises high.
you're lovin me so easy.
your wish is my command.
just hold me close and love me.
tell me it won't end.
"mm, feels so right, feels so right, feels so right."
"aw, you feel so right baby."
"the stillness here,"
"like what he sometimes finds inside her,"
hits so hard it can steal your breath forever.
he sometimes wonders
is the sum of their lives together
him on the floor and her lost to a mind in tatters.
these days he's drinking for the pleasure of falling
and he's falling for the pleasure of pretending
that she's sitting by the window waiting
for him to come calling.
if i could fix me up a week of twilight hours
we'd sit on the point
and watch the sun continually flounder.
bathed in gold we'd plug into some kind of power
and connect with those days
back before all of this went sour.
'cause i'm drinking for the pleasure of falling
and i'm falling for the pleasure of pretending
that you're sitting by the window waiting
for me to come calling.
odd how the darkness always makes us whisper
and with the last of the sun
you can feel the approach of the winter.
now is the time of each day that i
desperately miss her.
i suppose i will learn how to live my life without her.
so you're drinking for the pleasure of falling
and you're falling for the pleasure of pretending
that i'm sitting by the window waiting
for you to come calling.
"i won't lie, it hurts like hell"
"so i'm doing shots, just trying to deal"
"with all this pain, she left me with"
so i'm getting gone so i can get
blacked out
like elvis in 1968
like johnny cash any given day
like a mach 1 fastback mustang
i'm blacked out like the clouds hanging over this heart of mine
these ray-ban's covering up my eyes
"not a shadow of a doubt, blacked out"
her goodbye rattles around
just like a ghost in this house
"that's why i drink, to drown it out"
it's the only way i know to let her go for a little while
blacked out
like elvis in 1968
like johnny cash any given day
like a mach 1 fastback mustang
i'm blacked out like the clouds hanging over this heart of mine
these ray-ban's covering up my eyes
"not a shadow of a doubt, blacked out"
blacked out
like that label on the bottle of jack
the old guitar emmylou has
like the coal at the bottom of an old mine shaft
blacked out
like the clouds hanging over this heart of mine
these ray-ban's covering up my eyes
not a shadow of a doubt
"no, there's not a shadow of a doubt"
blacked out
blacked out
let me tell you bout a guy i know she's my baby and he lives next door
every morning fore the sun comes up he brings my coffee in my favorite cup
that's why i know yes i know hallelujah i just love him so
when i'm in trouble and i have no friends i know he'll go with me untill the end
everybody asks me how i know i smile at them and say he told me so
that's why i know yes i know hallelujah i just love him so
when i call him on the telephone and tell him that i'm all alone
by the time i count from one to four i hear him on my door
in the evening when the sun goes down when there is nobody else around
he kisses me and he holds me tight and tells me baby everything's all right
that's why i know yes i know hallelujah i just love him so
[ sax ]
when i call him on the telephone...
you came into my life like an answer to a prayer
like a star that falls from the sky right out of thin air
some might say itâ€™s a miracle or a dream come true
but from that day i always knew
heaven is missing an angel
thatâ€™s the only thing that it can be
heaven is missing an angel
â€˜cause youâ€™re right here with me
no one else in the world has touched me like you do
"itâ€™s super natural, girl, the way i feel when iâ€™m with you"
iâ€™m in paradise whenever youâ€™re around
then when i look in your eyes thereâ€™s no doubt
heaven is missing an angel
thatâ€™s the only thing that it can be
heaven is missing an angel
â€˜cause youâ€™re right here with me
iâ€™m in paradise whenever youâ€™re around
then when i look in your eyes thereâ€™s no doubt
heaven is missing an angel
thatâ€™s the only thing that it can be
heaven is missing an angel
â€˜cause youâ€™re right here with me
right here with me
(g.j.)
you always said someday you'd go to live
(in southern california)
and me i'd stay right here in tennessee
you always talked about the better days
(in southern california)
but if you'll stay in tennessee
i promise there'll be better days with me
(t. w.)
it's not that i don't love you
but i hear the call
(from southern california)
there's something i can't find in tennessee
silver screens and limousines
they wait for me in southern california
though you've been so good to me
the time has come you'll have to set me free
(g.j.)
tomorrow when you leave
you'll take my heart
(to southern california)
but just remember i'll be here
to keep your heart with me until you see
(t.w.) speaks:
"well, it's been five years"
n' i guess i've cried a million tears
lookin' out the window of this little room
"right over that flashin' neon sign that says, ""bar"""
"it's almost midnight,"
an time to go downstairs and go to work
"i wonder how he's doin' in, tennessee?"
(g.j.) spoken:
"well, here i sit by the window"
of this big old lonely mansion
lookin' out over the smokies
and on in everything i can see
"oh, i guess by now she's found"
what she was lookin' for
and as i look at this old faded photograph
of the girl that i still love
"i wonder if she ever, thinks of me"
(both)
but the weather's good
i've been living a new way of life that i love so
but i can see the clouds are gathering and the storm will wreck our home
for last night he hugged you tightly and you didn't even shove
this is true for i've been watching from the window up above
you must have thought that i was sleeping and i wish that i had been
but it's best to get to know you and the way your heart can sin
i thought we belonged together and our hearts fit like a glove
but i was wrong for i've been watching from the window up above
[ piano ]
from my eyes the teardrops started as i listened on and on
heard you whisper to him softly that our marriage was all wrong
but i hope he makes you happy and you will never lose his love
i lost my mind while i was watching from the window up above
now i wished i could be dreaming and wake up to a love that's true
but i was wrong for i've been watching from the window
love coming down

i remeber how your eyes used to light up all the promises that i made
but for the first time in my life i know now how it feels to be afraid
i don't know what i do if you go away this will sure be one lonely old town
for a man that's so busy going up in the world that he couldn't see love coming down
love coming down
i remember all the times you told me love's all that mattered to you
and looking back now wondering how i believe i had things more important to do
i can see how i must have looked to you like some fool on a merry-go-round
another man so busy going up in the world i couldn't see love coming down
love coming down
can't you see how everything i've learned would just be wasted if you leave me
if you'll just give it one more try i swear i'll always be here when you need me
if you can find it in your heart to firgive me i'll try to keep my feet on the ground
forgive a man so busy going up in the world that he couldn't see love coming down
love coming down love coming down
he left his dead in the cottonwood trees
the ground grown too hard with the years
falling down was not what it used to be
the ground grown too hard with the years
he told his children those little white lies
the truth would only paralyze them
he told himself those little white lies
the truth would only paralyze him
"lay it down, lay it down"
"he sold most of what he cherished,"
the rest he let them steal
"shot his dog out in the open field,"
the rest he let them steal
"he broke all of his promises,"
under a sea green sky
"they never thought to ask him why,"
under a sea green sky
"lay it down, lay it down"
please bury me in the cottonwood trees
the ground grown too cold for me
going to sleep tonight in a warm feather bed
the ground grown too cold for me
"lay it down, lay it down"
lots of ladies look at me
with want to in their eyes
but each time they do
i think of you and it makes me realize
cause an old love won’t do
any old love won’t do
any old love won’t do
i don’t want to love
if it isn’t with you
any old love won’t do
you’ve got the only arms
i’ve ever come runnin’ to
love has always led me to your bed
just any old love won’t do
i could spend forever
any never want nobody new
"with you by my side, i’m satisfied"
just any old love won’t do
what are we doing in this place alone is our desire to relive our past this strong
true love we knew in the past is gone but our weakness lingers on
let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control
now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown cold
if we live our past in the present our future will be gone
let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
[ fiddle ]
line with temptation we raced into the past
on a road too small to let the past and the present pass
are we going too fast to turn back and leave the past alone
let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
long ago we let the flame...
let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
i've been throwin' horseshoes
over my left shoulder
i've spent most all my life
searchin' for that four-leaf clover
"yet, you ran with me"
chasin' my rainbows
"and honey, i love you, too"
that's the way love goes
"that's the way love goes, babe"
that's the music god made
for all the world to sing
"it's never old, it grows"
losin' makes me sorry
"you say, ""honey, don't worry"""
"don't you know, i love you too?"
that's the way love goes
"that's the way love goes, babe"
that's the music god made
for all the world to sing
"it's never old, it grows"
losin' makes me sorry
"you say, ""honey, don't worry"""
"don't you know, i love you too?"
that's the way love goes
there’s a picture of you and me on the mantel
madee the day your dad gave you to me
now i know why tears filled his eyes
it hurt so much for him to watch you leave
you’ve always been a one man woman
giving all you have to just one man
you’ve always been a one man woman
and you’ve made me a one woman man
once again your older stuff in snow-white satin
holding one red rose in your hands
now i can’t hide the tears in my eyes
as i reach down to take your wedding band
i know we all belong to jesus
and now he’s come to take you home
you’ve always been a one man woman
giving all you have to just one man
you’ve always been a one man woman
and jesus knows someday i’ll understand
"well, i know she likes to karaoke any song by bon jovi"
she'll hop on stage and move her hips
make the girls jealous and the boys whipped
"i know she lies that satin dress, it's tight"
"and short, cut to impress"
"she got the curves, she got the style"
and that million dollar come here smile
but there's something you should know about
she's leaving pieces all over this town
she must like broken hearts
'cause she breaks them all the time
"it's every single day and every night, night, night"
she got that kinda something make a grown man cry
"yeah, she must like broken hearts"
'cause she breaks them all the time
she likes the way that cartier
she can shake her booty like beyoncé
"she can boot, scoot or dip, baby, dip"
turn the dance floor into a mash pit
i know she lies them foreign cars
and living large like a rock star
"you can buy a shop, she'll throw it back"
she loves to flirt and she loves a laugh
"you might get her number, you think it's home"
"but when you call her, it's just one digit off"
she must like broken hearts
'cause she breaks them all the time
"it's every single day and every night, night, night"
she got that kinda something make a grown man cry
"yeah, she must like broken hearts"
'cause she breaks them all the time
"she was born to run, she was born to fly"
"you can't tie her down, can't change her mind"
lord knows i've tried
she must like broken hearts
'cause she breaks them all the time
"it's every single day and every night, night, night"
she got that kinda something make a grown man cry
"yeah, she must like broken hearts"
'cause she breaks them all the time

he raced that engine down the track 'round the tree on christmas day
i was so amazed my dad would play with trains
"i saw a sparkle in his eye, then i heard him say, come on son let's play, i"
"was young once, too"
"he washed that buick faithfully, lord he kept her clean"
i thought that machine meant more to him than me
on the day i turned sixteen he threw me the keys
"said i was young once, too, now she belongs to you"
"he was such a young man then, i'm older than that now"
"i hope i measure up to him, when the circle comes around"
i saw him in the attic sittin' cross legged on the floor
"with some old photographs, he point and laughed"
"he said, that's me in that picture, i said, no son, that's your dad"
"i was young once, too, and looked a lot like you"
"i was young once, too, i was young once, too"
"merry christmas son, i wish your grandpa were here"
"he was young once, too, and looked like me and you"
like a raging flood that ruins a poor man's land
you keep doing things to hurt me all you can
but the thickness that we knew is growing thin
how much rain can one man stand
how much rain can one man stand
i gave you everything but my right hand
if you won't let me love you then don't let me be your friend
how much rain can one man stand
i can see them big old storm clouds movin' in
there's a stranger in your big brown eyes again
and you've told him that i'm just an old time friend
how much rain can one man stand
how much rain can one man stand...
how much rain can one man stand

you tear me down a hundred times a day i've cried enough to wash the world away
i've tried so hard to be what you've wanted me to be
till somewhere along the way i lost me
to give and keep on giving i have learned
there's no way but yours where you're concerned
i tried till finally i lost my own identity and somewhere along the way i lost me
somewhere along the way i lost the man i used to be
a man who smiled enjoyed life loved you with all of me

he lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack
his real name was jackson taylor but i called him applejack
now old applejack was loved by everyone he ever knew
applejack picked apples but he picked the banjo too
"play a song for me applejack, applejack"
play a song for me and i'll sing
"play a song for me applejack, applejack"
"play a song, let your banjo ring"
now i'd go down to applejack's almost everyday
we'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old applejack had made
then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if i'd sing
and he would play the banjo and i'd play my tambourine
that's when i was just a kid and now that i am grown
"all i have are memories, old applejack is gone"
oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back
and everytime i play it i still hear applejack
this is a song
about best friends
john roy
was a boy i knew
since he was three
and i was two
grew up two little houses
down from me
the only two bad apples
on our family tree
kind of ripened and rotted
in our puberty
two kindred spirits bound by destiny
well now i was smart
but i lacked ambition
johnny was wild
with no inhibition
was about like mixin
fire and gasoline
(and he'd say)
hey romeo
let's go down to mexico
chase senoritas
drink ourselves silly
show them mexican girls
a couple of real hillbillies
got a pocket full of cash
and that old ford truck
a fuzzy cat hangin
from the mirror for luck
said don't you know
all those little
brown-eyed girls
want playboys of the southwestern world
long around
our eighteenth year
we found two plane tickets
the hell out of here
got scholarships
to some small town
school in texas
learned to drink sangria
til the dawns early light
eat eggs ranchero
and throw up all night
and tell those daddy's girls
we were majoring in a rodeo
ah but my
favorite memory
at school that fall
was the night john roy
came runnin down the hall
wearin nothin
but cowboy boots
and a big sombrero
(and he was yellin)
hey romeo
let's go down to mexico
chase senoritas
drink ourselves silly
show them mexican girls
a couple of real hillbillies
got a pocket full of cash
and that old ford truck
a fuzzy cat hangin
from the mirror for luck
said don't you know
all those little
brown-eyed girls
want playboys of the southwestern world
and i said
we had a little
change in plans
like when paul mccartney
got busted in japan
and i said
we got waylaid
when we laid foot
on mexican soil
see the boarder guard
with the fu manchu mustache
kind of stumbled on john's
pocket full of american cash
he said
doin a little funny business
in mexico amigo
but all i could think about
was savin my own tail
when he mentioned ten years
in a mexican jail
so i pointed to john roy and said
it's all his now please let me go
well it was your idea genius
i was just layin there in bed
when you said
hey romeo
let's go down to mexico
chase senoritas
drink ourselves silly
show them mexican girls
a couple of real hillbillies
got a pocket full of cash
and that old ford truck
a fuzzy cat hangin
from the mirror for luck
said don't you know
all those little
brown-eyed girls
want playboys of the southwestern world
ah we're still best friends
temporary cell mates
when loving turns to parting
i'm always the first to leave
cause when it comes to heartaches
i'd rather give than to receive
i've never cried myself to sleep
just praying i'll get through
i've never lost at love not counting you
not counting you i've never had a heartache
not counting you i never have been blue
there's no exceptions to the rule
i've never been nobody's fool
i've never lost at love not counting you
i've never got down on my knees
and asked the lord above
if he would only bring to me
the one i'm dreaming of
begging to be taken back
and swearing i'll be true
has never crossed my mind not counting you
there's no exceptions to the rule
i've never been nobody's fool
i've never lost at love not counting you
there's no exceptions to the rule
i've never been nobody's fool
i've never lost at love not counting you
"no, i've never lost at love not counting you"
if i didn't care more than words can say
if i didn't care would i feel this way
if this isn't love then why do i thrill
and what makes my head go round and round
while my heart stands still
if i didn't care would it be the same
would my every prayer begin and end with just your name
and would i be sure that this is love beyond compare
would all this be true if i didn't care for you
[ sax ]
and would i be sure that this...
( if i didn't care)
you shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
too much love can drive a girl insane
you broke my will oh but what a thrill
goodness gracious great balls of fire
i like that love cause i thought it was funny
you came along and you move me honey

i'll need time
to get you off my mind
i may sometimes bother you
try to be in touch with you
even ask too much of you
from time to time
now and then
lord ya know i'll need a friend
til i get used to losing you
let me keep on using you
til i can make it on my own
i'll get by
but no matter how i try
there'll be times you know i'll call
chances are my tears will fall
and i'll have no pride at all
from time to time
but they say
oh there'll be a brighter day
but til then i'll lean on you
that's all i mean to do
til i can make it on my own
surely someday i'll look up and see the mornin sun
without another lonely night behind me
then i'll know i'm over you and all my cryin's done
no more hurtin memories can find me
but til then
lord ya know i'm gonna need a friend
til i get used to losing you
let me keep on using you
til i can make it on my own
til i can make it on my own...
i like the way you make my heart beat faster
you got me feeling like a sweet disaster
"oooh, and i like it"
"you like the way i say ""i'm crazy about you"""
you love the way it makes your heart go boom boom boom
"oooh, you know you like it"
it just gets better every day
tell me forever that we'll always be this way
this is how we'll always stay
you'll still be kissing me the way you
you'll still be loving me and i'll be loving you
"please stay, we'll always be this way"
everybody says we'll never make it
but they don't have a clue what they're sayin'

"oh, can't you see that for worse or for better"
we're better together

we're better together
"please, just come back home"
and don't say that you're sorry

dolly parton - halo and horns
"halos and horns, sinners and saints,"
hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
just because it feels right does not make it so
so we struggle through life in horns and halos
tempted and tried with each step we take
"we stumble and slide and make our mistakes,"
"ask god to forgive us for all of our sins,"
then we take off our horns and wear halos again
"halos and horns, sinners and saints,"
hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
just because it feels right does not make it so
so we struggle through life in horns and halos
"halos and horns, sinners and saints,"
"we're praised or we're scorned, we either run or we faint"
"oh, but life is a challenge from the day that we're born"
just tryin' to balance halos and horns
"it's heaven or hell, halos or horns"
"halos and horns, sinners and saints,"
hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
"but just because it feels right; well, that don't make it so"

i've live to the limit maybe a little bit more
there are so many stories of how i got out of control
some say it's a woman
some say it's my trouble soul
i'm like a crazy old soldier
fightin' a war on my own
just me and the whiskey
and the bottles are ten thousand strong
you'd think i'd give up
as many times as i've been hit
but like a crazy old soldier
i just don't know when to quit
barrooms and bedrooms
are just faces and places and names
once for the pleasure
and lord knows once for the pain
i've tried to forget her
and all of the things that we've done
but as long as there are memories
i'll never hang up my gun
i'm like a crazy old solider
fightin' a war on my own
just me and the whiskey
and the bottles are ten thousand strong
you'd think i'd give up
as many times as i've been hit
but like crazy old solider
i just don't know when to quit
like a crazy old solider
i just don't know when to quit
by jpr
i had to look through our old pictures
to see the way we used to smile
before we left love in the closet
like it just went out of style
can we pull out those old feelin's
wipe the hurt away like dust
make love shine the way it used to shine
find the gold beneath the rust
that's all i need to know
do you wanna stay together
just say let's don't let go
and i'll keep holdin' on forever
have the teardrops that you've cried
drowned the fire in your eyes
is there one flame beneath the smoke
tell me is there any hope
that's all i need to know
is it too late to recover
those old smiles we used to wear
can we save a love that once was strong
before it breaks beyond repair
that's all i need to know
do you wanna stay together
just say let's don't let go
and i'll keep holdin' on forever
have the teardrops that you've cried
drowned the fire in your eyes
is there one flame beneath the smoke
tell me is there any hope
that's all i need to know
is there one flame beneath the smoke
tell me is there any hope
that's all i need to know
"she sparkles, she dazzeles"
she lights up the room
we walk together
to a table for two
every man stares
but her eyes are only for me
we take to the dance floor
she squezzes my hand
i can't believe
just how lucky i am
meanwhile
back in the back of my memory
you're still dancing with me
and i'm holding you once again
meanwhile
we move to the end of a beautiful night
tender the kisses
soft candle light
she draws the curtains
and slowly we climb up the stairs
and reach for each other
the passion begins
we fall together
as lovers and then
meanwhile
back in the back of my memory
you're still lying with me
and i'm holding you once again
i try and i try
lord knows i do
but each time my heart
beats back to you
meanwhile
i'll go on living my life now
i'll find a way somehow
oh but
meanwhile
back in the back of my memory
you'll always be with me
but i'll never hold you again
meanwhile
i heard you've been wondering
how i'm getting along
i guess you think i can't make it with you gone
but i don't want you to worry
don't you lose any sleep
but a man called long-distance this morning
said they're thinking about putting me
on the cover of the usa today
the story of heart-breaking pain
picture of the loneliest man they claim in the usa today
i don't sleep in the nighttime
darkness reminds me of you
i lost eight pounds since last tuesday
but i could stand to lose a few
i don't believe i'm too bad
people say i look fine
the man from the paper seems happy
says i'm bigger than the latest crime
on the cover of the usa today
the story of heart-breaking pain
picture of the loneliest man they claim in the usa today
so if you're concerned in trouble
then you're hurting me
don't you work out this little thing called losing you
has made a big man out of me
i'm on the cover of the usa today
the story of heart-breaking pain
picture of the loneliest man they claim in the usa today
leon dixon leaves his christmas lights up all year ‘round
it’s somethin’ different about our town
we’ve often wondered why he never takes ‘em down
but leon leaves his christmas lights up all year ‘round
there’s a big bright noel flashin’ off and on
in the yard where the children play the whole year long
we’ve all gotten used to it year by year
now it’s kinda gotten to be a part of things ‘round here
"peace on earth, good will to men"
christmas time is here again
can it be all that wrong
to feel like christmas all year long
"leon got sick, it’s been back awhile"
"short on luck and money, but he still wore that smile"
and nobody could stand to see him do without
so we all drove over to see if we could help out
"yeah, the noel flashed on and the bills stayed paid"
i felt so warm as we drove away
i had never seen christmas spelled so clear
as when i saw “leon” flashin’ in my rear view mirror

"well i never thought that i, could make it alone"
thought i would die but i seem to carry on
and i thought my life would surely leave
"and though almost, i have not ceased to be"
and even though i thought i lost everything
"today i found, that the birds still sing in the morning"
and the world keeps spinnin' 'round
and the world keeps spinnin' 'round
"when someone says goodbye, another dream ends"
and just before you give up another dream begins
"someone changed their mind, tears fall to the ground"
but you know that one man's smile is another's frown
"and the table will turn someday, that's how life is, i have no doubt"
'cause you know that time don't stand still
all the world keeps spinnin' 'round
yes the world keeps spinnin' 'round
dawn will find me here and i think about
one that i thought i couldn't live without
"one day she was here, the next day gone"
but the love that was never clear was just alone
"and how can you lose something you only thought, that you found"
so you wipe away the tears with a smile
all the world keeps spinnin' 'round
yes the world keeps spinnin' 'round
all the world keeps spinnin' 'round
all the world keeps spinnin' 'round
i wonder were you cold that night
lying there by mary's side
taking your first breath
i wonder were you scared to death
"fully human, fully god"
full of wonder and the blood
that one day you would shed to save the world
tiny feet and tiny hands
with all the earth at their command
it must have felt strange to you
sweet baby jesus
come down to love us
to lie in a manger
so far from home
you could have left us
helpless and so lost
but you chose to save us
sweet baby jesus
the first time mary held you close
all wrapped up in tattered clothes
did you see tears fall from her eyes
just a mother holding her first child
"fully human, fully god"
full of wonder and the blood
that one day you would shed to save the world
tiny feet and tiny hands
with all the earth at their command
"oh, it must have been strange to you"
sweet baby jesus
come down to love us
to lie in a manger
so far from home
"oh, you could have left us"
helpless and so lost
but you chose to save us
sweet baby jesus
sweet baby jesus
come down to love us
to lie in a manger
to die on a cross
"oh, you could have left us"
"helpless and so, so lost"
but you chose to save us
sweet baby jesus
sweet baby jesus
away in a manger no crib for a bed
the little lord jesus lay down his sweet head
the stars in the bright sky look down where he lay
the little lord jesus asleep on the hay
the cattle are lowing the baby awakes
the little lord jesus no crying he makes
i love the lord jesus look down from the sky
and stay by my cradle 'till morning is night
away in a manger no crib for a bed
the little lord jesus lay down his sweet head
the stars in the bright sky look down where he lay
the little lord jesus asleep on the hay
the little lord jesus asleep
"been runnin' around, seen many a town,"
and maybe you'll find i'm the kind of guy that brags.
but listen to me and see if you don't agree
no melody rolls like that old steel guitar rag
"and when they slide that thing, along those strings"
"it soubds so dogone heavenly, you can hear the angels sing"
"and when you stomp your feet, your heart will beat,"
a rhythm to the old steel guitsr rag
"you may be kind choosy, 'bout the kind of songs you hear,"
"you maybe like them blusey, makes you cry right in your beer,"
"but if you want a song that's bound to dry away your tears,"
make happy your soul with that old steel guitar rag.
in our bedroom there's a portrait done in different shades of gray
that i painted out before you broke my heart
in the scatch we're arm in arm but in the background there's a storm
and it soon become and tear my world apart
and before my days are over i'm gonna try my hand again
do a portrait like i wanted life to be
put some flowers on the ground and color springtime all around
and paint the bed of roses just for me
i'm gonna paint me a bed of roses
one without one single cloud in a big blue sky
yeah i'm gonna paint me a bed of roses
where love and patience never die
no small miracle
by kenny chesney
in a little town down south
there's little plowboard house
with a wolf outside the door
and in the bedroom there's a light
its been staying on all night
for at least a month or more
the heartaches and the bills keep coming due
and with all they're going through
its no small miracle that love hangs on
hearts get weary when hope is gone
in a world where roses wither and die
its no small miracle when love survives
its been uphill for a while
but he still makes her smile
every now and then
lately they been finding out
it's the little things that count
and they do what they can
he tells her he loves her everyday
she says things will be ok
in a world where roses wither and die
it's no small miracle when love survives
when the sun came up this morning i took the time to watch it rise
and as its beauty struck the darkness from the sky
i thought how small and unimportant all my troubles seem to be
and how lucky another day belongs to me
and as the sleepy world around me woke up to greet the day
all its silent beauties seemed to say
so what my friend if all your dreams you have and realized
just look around you you got a whole new day to try
today is mine today is mine to do with what i will
today is mine my own special cup to fill
to die a little that i might learn to live to take from life that i might learn to give
today is mine
like most men i cursed the present to avoid the peace of mind
and raise my thoughts beyond tomorrow and vision there more peace of mind
but as i view this day around me i can see the fool i've been
for today's the only garden we can tend
today is mine...
i was feelin' the blues
i was watching the news
when this fella came on the tv
he said i'm tellin' you
that science has proven
that heartaches are healed by the sea
that got me goin'
without even knowin'
i packed right up and drove down
now i'm on a roll
and i swear to my soul
tonight i'm gonna paint this town
so bring me two pina coladas
one for each hand
let's set sail with captain morgan
and never leave dry land
troubles i forgot 'em
i buried 'em in the sand
so bring me two pina coladas
she said good-bye to her good timin' man
oh now i've gotta say
that the wind and the waves
and the moon winkin' down at me
eases my mind
by leavin' behind
the heartaches that love often brings
now i've got a smile
that goes on for miles
with no inclination to roam
i've gotta say
that i think i've gotta stay
'cause this is feelin' more and more like home
so bring me two pina coladas
one for each hand
let's set sail with captain morgan
and never leave dry land
hey troubles i forgot 'em
i buried 'em in the sand
so bring me two pina coladas
she said good-bye to her good timin' man

(angelo/troy verges/hillary lindsey)
fireflies are out tonight
air is heavy and the moon is bright
i love this time of year
i talked to you this afternoon
you said you didn't have very much to do
i said i'd be here
"so come on over, come on in, come on by baby"
otis redding makes me feel good
dancin' in the kitchen barefoot
"all the windows up, just can't get enough"
headlights on my front lawn
i guess it didn't take you very long to decide
"to come on over, come on in, come inside baby"
"won't you come on up, come on in, come inside baby"
there's just something 'bout the way
the way you talk to me
you give just what i need
and when you come around my feet can't find the ground
i'm losin' myself like a drop in the rain
you twist me up like a hurricane
i can't stand up for fallin' down
"so come on up, come on in, i like it when you come around"
a minute ago there were a million stars
and now it's soaking wet out in my backyard
let's take cover baby
but you just wanna run around in the rain
you make me laugh like a kid again
loud and crazy baby
there's just something 'bout the way
oh you said that you loved me that your heart would be true
"but now you've gone and left me, i'm so blue"
i believed in you darling that your heart would be true
"but now you've gone and left me, i'm so blue"
"our vows have been broken, you have proven untrue"
another has my sweetheart and the love that i once knew
i believed in you darling that your heart would be true
but now you've gone and left me i'm so blue
"oh the nights are so lonely, dreams of you haunt me so"
what's happened little darling i don't know
i believed in you darling that your heart would be true
but now you've gone and left me i'm so blue
i've made some decisions
never not the best
against my better judgment
i must confess
i went astray so many ways
so my dreams fall apart
and came a day i'm glad to say
i followed my heart
that feeling the one i'm feeling now
oh that feeling that turned me all around
that feeling oh what love can do
that feeling that never let's me down
oh that feeling that always come around
i never need another
it's gonna last my whole life through
that feeling i'm feeling for you
looking in the mirror
reflecting on the past
memories or misery
that's all fading fast
these eyes over my shoulder
oh they make me realise
i've made the right decision
the day i recognized
that feeling the one i'm feeling now
oh that feeling that turned me all around
that feeling oh what love can do
that feeling that never let's me down
oh that feeling that always come around
i never need another
it's gonna last my whole life through
that feeling i'm feeling for you

daddy can you hear the devil drawing near
"like a bullet from a gun, run daddy run."
all the songs you used to sing to me
would rock birds to sleep
i need you now so please somehow
put rockets on your feet
daddy can you hear the devil drawing near
"like a bullet from a gun, run daddy run."
saw the dark could coming from a million miles away.
oh how i've dreaded this god forsaken day.
daddy can you hear the devil drawing near
"like a bullet from a gun, run daddy run."
mama's been crying in the kitchen
sister's been afraid of the dark.
i've been gathering the pieces of all these shattered hearts.
and i don't care where you go to
and i don't care where you land
but just get out of there daddy as fast as you can
"oh, oh, oh"
daddy can you hear the devil drawing near
"like a bullet from a gun, run daddy run."
"run daddy run, run daddy run, run daddy run."
"sweet little cherry blossom, blooming before her time"
"moving her lips to her favorite song, cherishing every rhyme"
"swaying her hips to the rhythm, humming along with the tune"
"lost in her own little dream world, slow dancing with the moon"
watching her i cannot help but go back in my mind
and suddenly i find i am 15 again
slow dancing with the moon
"oh, the stars got in my eyes long time ago"
and i've lived my life like a love sick clown
in a bittersweet cartoon
just a dreamy-eyed kid slow dancing with the moon
watching the girl i'm reminded she's quite a lot like me
"trapped in the suburbs of wonderland, lost in her own fantasy"
"somehow my heart never grew up, no one ever burst my balloon"
so here i am swirling in star dust slow dancing with the moon
still believe someday my wildest dreams will all come true
and i'll find someone who'll make me 15 again
but until then i'm slow dancing with the moon
"oh, the stars got in my eyes long time ago"
and i've lived my life like a love sick clown
in a bittersweet cartoon
just a dreamy-eyed kid slow dancing with the moon
tag:
still a starry-eyed kid slow dancing with the moon
"well, i met sammy samson down in new orleans"
he had a lot of money and a big limousine
he took us honky-tonkin' on a saturday night
"we met silly milly, everything was all right"
"her eyes started rollin', we should a-went a-bowlin'"
"wham-bam, who shot sam, my-my"
"well, sam and silly milly, about a quarter to four"
was rompin' and a-stompin' on the hardwood floor
along came flirty mirty bargin' in on the fun
silly milly got jealous and she pulled out a gun
"tables started crashin', fourty-four's a-flashin'"
"wham-bam, who shot sam, my-my"
"well, the police, fire chief, highway patrol"
knockin' down the front door with a big long pole
sammy was a lyin' on the cold-cold floor
shot through the middle with a fourty-four
"milly was a-cryin', sam was surely dyin'"
"wham-bam, who shot sam, my-my"
"well, they took silly milly to the jail down town"
booked silly milly for a-shootin' old sam
"the judge he gave her twenty, milly said that's a lot"
"you shouldn't give me nothing, he was already half shot"
a-drinkin' white lightnin' started all the fightin'
"wham-bam, who shot sam, my-my"
"well, the police, fire chief, highway patrol"
knockin' down the front door with a big long pole
sammy was a lyin' on the cold-cold floor
shot through the middle with a fourty-four

"little girl, if you're feeling low"
and you got no place to go
just give me a ring
some joy i will bring
'cause i ain't got nothin' but time
"well, i ain't got nothin' but time"
"so baby, if you wanna shine"
if you take time to look

and you can call me any time
i'm footloose and i'm fancy free
"so baby, just come along with me"
grab your dancin' shoes
we'll go and lose them blues
'cause i ain't got nothin' but time
"if you say so babe, we'll stay all night"
"don't worry, 'cause i ain't got no wife"
any time you wanna go
"good gal, just let me know"
'cause i ain't got nothin' but time
no use to sit at home and fine
and let someone trouble your mind
just come along with me
there's more fish in the sea
and i ain't got nothin' but time
"now baby, just come on and smile"
you'll find that life is still worth while
if you just look around
and watch the fellars in this town
that for you ain't got nothin' but time
"lord, i ain't got nothin' but time"
"so baby, if you wants to shine"
if you take time to look
my number's in the book
and you can call me any time
(bill lloyd/hillary lindsey)
it's been so long
i should be used to this by now
loneliness that keeps coming back around
the moon on my window casts a different light
on all these memories that keep me up tonight
"hey, i know just what i need"
that's you and in a hurry
if i got on the road right now
i'd see you at four thirty
"hey, i think i have about"
sixty miles of gasoline left in my car
there's an all night truck stop
"yeah, i bet i could get that far"
i can close my eyes and smell coffee in the air
"i'll fill my cup, if you'll wait up"
i'll soon be there
"hey, i'm letting go"
so baby don't you worry
wheels on ground
i won't slow down
i'll see you at four thirty
"hey, i..yeah"
"hey, i won't allow my mind"
to talk me out of this
past every exit sign
cause that's the way it is
"hey, i'm letting go"
so baby don't you worry
wheels on ground
i won't slow down
"i'll see you, yeah"
"hey, i know just what i need"
that's you and in a hurry
"oh, wheels on ground, i won't slow down"
"i always say the first thing, not the right thing"
i'm better at a last call than a phone call
i'd rather lean hard on the gas and forget about the brake
i try to laugh the truth off instead of face it
i come undone without a warning
"every time i move on, i leave damage in my wake"
i'm not what you were looking for
thought i was hello and nothing more
"all you wanted was something that's real, a story to tell"
"a drink, maybe two, top of the shelf"
a stare in a cab on the way to some band
and a curbside closing time kiss
"you needed the right head to turn, the right hand to touch"
"a feeling to chase, a fall you could trust"
"somewhere to run, someone to miss"
somehow you ended up with someone to fix
"oh, oh, oh"
did you get caught up in the moment?
drop your guard for just a minute
how'd you get tangled all up in the careless wreck i am?
broken hearts leave hearts broken
"loving me is so hard, i know it"
"why you took me on, i'll never understand"
"you were looking for something that's real, a story to tell"
"a drink, maybe two, top of the shelf"
a stare in a cab on the way to some band
a curbside closing time kiss
"you needed the right head to turn, the right hand to touch"
"a feeling to chase, a fall you could trust"
"somewhere to run, someone to miss"
somehow you ended up with someone to fix
"oh, oh, oh"
"oh, oh, oh"
"all you wanted was something that's real, a story to tell"
"a drink, maybe two, top of the shelf"
a stare in a cab on the way to some band
and a curbside closing time kiss
"you needed the right head to turn, the right hand to touch"
"a feeling to chase, a fall you could trust"
"somewhere to run, someone to miss"
somehow you ended up with someone to fix
"oh, oh, oh"
"oh, oh, oh"
as when i was a little girl times were hard in this whole world
but there's a silver lining behind every cloud
just poor people that's all we were tryin' to make a livin' out of black land dirt
we'd get together in a family circle and sing out loud
(daddy sang bass mama sang tenor)
me and little brother would join right in there
singin' seems to help us troubled soul
one of these days and it won't be long i'll rejoin them in a song
i'm gonna join the family circle at the throne
no the circle won't be broken by and by lord by and by
(daddy sang bass mama sang tenor)
me and little brother would join right in there in the sky lord in the sky
[ guitar ]
now i remember after work mama would call in all of us
you could hear us singin' for a country mile
now little brother has done gone on but i'll rejoin him in a song
we'll be together again up yonder in a while
(daddy sang bass...
in the sky lord in the sky

nothing left to pack
there ain't no room for me in that car
even if she asked me to tag along

i painted this big ol' smile on my face
to hide my broken heart
if only she knew
this is where i don't say what i want so bad to say
this is where i want to but i won't get in the way
of her and her dreams
and spreadin' her wings

he’s living in that big old house that he knows was built by me
he’s playing with the baby that belongs to her and me.
at night he loves a woman that was held by these two hands
he must be leaving hell to live with a ghost of another man.
my name is in the side wall outside our bedroom door
he can’t help but see what’s too dare in me everywhere he goes.
he gladly walked through heaven to forget what he can’t stand
he must be leaving hell to live with a ghost of another man.
i don’t mean to haunt him when they turn out the lights
i’m there in the bedroom with both of them each night.
and he wonders if he just loved her
as good as i loved her back then
he must be leaving hell to live
with a ghost of another man.
they don't have rhinestone ball and chains
lunch trays don't come with chardonnay
the bars there ain't got boys to buy us drinks
we'd stick out like two bottled blondes
i must admit it don't sound fun
for fifteen girls to have to share one sink
"he cheated, he's a villain"
and you know i'd help you kill him
but we're way too pretty for prison
hard time ain't our kind of living
and i don't want to talk about
the way those jumpsuits wash us out
we're way too pretty for prison
antifreeze and gatorade
arsenic in his lemonade
takes just one snip to bleed his brakes
but we ain't gonna do it
(she ain't gonna do it)
"yeah, we've been watching too much tv"
"you ain't thelma, i ain't louise"
but if we ask 'em they'd both agree
we should put him through it
(don't put him through it)
"he cheated, he's a villain"
so let's hire somebody to kill him
'cause we're way too pretty for prison
"yeah, hard time ain't our kind of living"
and i don't want to talk about
the way those jumpsuits wash us out
we're way too pretty for prison

"no sun tan city, not to mention"
that lack of waxing situation

the way those jumpsuits wash us out
we're way too pretty for prison

she’s 98 pounds
working down at the dairy queen
with an ogilvie home perm and braces
"and he’s long-haired, no job and just 19"
they got a baby on the way
and they’re off to the races in...
love
look at ‘em go
now what in the world could go wrong
don’t tell them the odds
it’s best they don’t know
if love was a plane
nobody’d get on
at the ivy at lunchtime in beverly hills
the paparazzi are gathered outside
‘cause an actor and an actress are having lunch
and according to extra and entertainment tonight
they’re in
imagine now the pilot’s voice
on the intercom right before
we leave the ground
saying folks thanks for flying with us
but there’s a 6 in 10 chance
we’re going down
but that’s the strangest thing
about this emotion
even knowing our chances are small
we line up at the gate with our tickets
thinking somehow we’re different
i mean after all we’re in
love
look at us go
now what in the world could go wrong
to hell with the odds
we’d rather not know
if love was a plane
nobody’d get on
"yeah, if love was a plane"
nobody’d get on
from the moment that we met
my world was turned around
upside down
to some degree i still regret
my memory for keeping you around
girl i thought that you were mine
but my broken hearts been shattered
one too many times
and i don’t want to see you anymore
i’m just not that strong
"i love it when you’re here,"
but i’m better when you’re gone
i’m certain that i’ve given and oh how you can take
there’s no use in you looking
there’s nothing left for you to break
baby please release me
let my heart rest in pieces
someone let you down again
so you turn to me
your convenient friend
oh but i know what you’re doing
and what you hope to find
i’ve seen it a thousand times
oh the fire we had before
are now just bitter ashes
left scattered on the floor...
when i think of the dreams i've let slip through my hands
and the years that i've wasted lord i've cried from my shame
but when i feel the glow of your love then i know
that i've done at least one thing that was good in my life
yes i've done at least one thing that was good in my life
and with you i have one dream that will live through the night
and each day i will know as i watch our love grow
that i've done at least one thing that was good in my life
when i think of the dreams i've let slip through my hands
and the years that i've wasted lord i've cried from my shame
but then when i feel the glow of your sweet love then i know
that i've done at least one thing that was good in my life
yes i've done at least one thing...
the old man paid no mind to color cause he knew that i'd been down and out
old joe said that i was a soul brother the things i been singin' about
he liked like i played my old guitar he sat by beside me the same
together we hung out an old timy blues hmm hmm hmm hmm
oh we sing aside a railroad track for people have nothing to lose
i'm a son of a gambler who's luck never came and a white man singin' the blues
we both done a heap of hard livin' and hard to discribing the song
but the blues was one thing we both understood and the old man hummed right along
oh we sing aside a railroad track...
(jerry chesnut)
oh i know a place called good time charley's
a little four piece band swingin' out of sight
and i'll be here if you want to party
from nine in the morning 'til twelve at night
two miles from town 'cross the railroad track
turn right at the light and park in the back
you're always welcome don't forget to drop in

well i heard talk about a trouble maker
dropped in one night and never came again
they said he'd left with an undertaker
"oh charley done time, two years in the pen"
well the beat goes on there's a hardwood floor
and the sound of laughter runnin' out the door
wall to wall women plenty of ice-cold beer

turn right at the light and park in the back
you're always welcome don't forget to drop in
at old good time charley's anytime you can

"my right hand holds matches,"
"my left holds my past,"
"i hope the wind catches,"
"and burns it down fast,"
"i'm gonna step into the fire,"
"with my failures and my shame,"
"and wave good-bye to yesterday,"
"as i dance among the flames,"
"so don't try to save me now,"
"let the walls of my world all burn down,"
"just stand back and wait till the smoke finally passes,"
"and i will rise,"
"from the ashes,"
"from the ashes,"
"from the ashes,"
"for all that i'm losing, much more will i gain,"
"the hard part is choosing,"
"to change what needs changed,"
"and my step will be much lighter,"
"with these demons off my chest,"
"i'm born a better spirit,"
and lay the old to rest
"so don't try to save me now,"
"let the walls of my world all burn down,"
"just stand back and wait till the smoke finally passes,"
and i will rise
"from the ashes,"
"from the ashes,"
"from the ashes,"
"and i'll walk away stronger,"
"i will be flyin,"
higher and truer
"than i've flown before,"
"my right hand holds matches,"
"my left holds my past,"
"i hope the wind catches,"
sat here by this stony brook until the grey day turned to dust
when up swam a fish with a children's book thought that i was lost.
"he was on his way to the salmon hop, that's where they go to breed"
saw me sitting on this log and thought i'd like to read.
the night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole
said that he felt bad for me cause i had no place to go
why aren't you at the harvest ball with some sweet young gal
you just sit like a bump on the log and call that fish your pal.
"well, i told him i was an orphan lived here all alone"
but many people have often tried to catch and take me home
they never caught me!
"thought that i was a hiding, call this log my home"
but the fish and the moon and a sweet young gal
all want me for their own.
the night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole
said that he felt bad for me cause i had no place to go
"so i met that gal at the harvest ball, she took me to her room"
"while i slept in children's dreams, the fish ran away with the moon."
the fish ran away with the moon
the fish ran away with the moon.
mmm....
we used to walk through fields of green
we used to sit by clear blue streams
we used to be so happy
me and you
we used to do such silly things
we used to make love in the rain
we used to
"yes, we used to"
then you went away
leaving me with the memories we made
memories of those sweet yesterdays
spent with you
spent with you
and even though you're gone
i still think so often of you
and the things that we no longer do
like we used to
oh we used to
we used to be so much in love
we used to kiss and hold and touch
we used to find so many things to do
we used to laugh and plan and dream
we used to own the world it seemed
we used to
yes we used to
then you went away
leaving me with the memories we made
memories of those sweet yesterdays
spent with you
spent with you
oh and even though you're gone
i still think so often of you
and the things that we no longer do
like we used to
oh we used to
la...mmm....
ahh....
love and learn about the birds and bees
and the flowers of the mystery
and if you really want to give yourself a blue love
and learn about the blues
the rocky road is pretty hard to take
but you don't know nothing till your heart breaks
if you want to know how much you've got to lose love
and learn about the blues
love is a game where your life gets spoken
but the game gets rough when your heart get broken
you'll say at home a sittin' all alone waitin' for the doorbell
or the telephone
then you'll know about what everyone must learn
if you play around with love your will sure to get burned
so when you go to pick a guy be careful who you choose
or you'll love and learn about the blues
[ sax ]
love is a game where life gets spoken...
"stressed out, running late, racing down the interstate"
"spilled hot coffee, down the front of my jeans"
"it's work, work, pay the rent, money and my time's spent"
not a minute left for me to be me
been going like nothing can wait
i gotta get my priorities straight
"i need to live a little, have some fun"
"take some time, waste it on number one"
find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
"live a little, love a lot"
"friday night, here we go, do a little do-si-do"
"kick back, have a laugh, catch my breath"
"tell the band slow it down, there she is, think i found"
"maybe ms. wonderful, i haven't met yet"
it just hit me like a wrecking ball
she's giving me a wake up call
"i need to live a little, have some fun"
"take some time, waste it on number one"
find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
"live a little, love a lot"
"step back, smell the rose"
feel the sand between your toes
"unplug, unwind"
step out in the sunshine
"i need to live a little, have some fun"
"take some time, waste it on number one"
find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
live a little
"i need to live a little, have some fun"
"take some time, waste it on number one"
"take the girl, get a map and pick any old dot"
"live a little, we need to live a little, love a lot"
well i see the souls of so many friends
and i see us all back here again
with sandy floors and ceiling fans
a rastafarian one-man band with songs
that fill my memories like a tip jar
"yeah, that's what i see"
when i see this bar
i see tourists at christmas time
and i taste beers with a hint of lime
i feel lonely cause it's not the same
different faces and different names
living like pirates out among the stars
"yeah, that's what i see"
when i see this bar
pieces of our past slowly slip away
but time just stands still when i walk in this place
and i see a kid coming into his own
and a man learning to move on
somehow trying to find his way
a dreamer betting on blind faith
chasing that sun and following his heart
"yeah, that's what i see"
when i see this bar
pieces of our past slowly slip away
but time just stands still when i walk in this place
a few have moved on back to maine
jacksonville and key biscayne
some are still living the dream
stuck in still life it seems
no matter where they've been
or where they are
"yeah, i see 'em here"
when i see this bar
when i see this bar
i wonder where we go from here
(that's what i see when i see this bar)
life ain't over but it's always near
(that's what i see when i see this bar)
i think about all the good times that we had
(that's what i see when i see this bar)
it makes me happy and it makes me sad
(that's what i see when i see this bar)
"how could we be so close, now so far apart"
(that's what i see when i see this bar)
"that's what i feel, that's what i see"
yeah we were living like pirates and wannabe stars
that's what i see when i see this bar
that's what i see when i see this bar
oh the power of love can make you leap tall buildings
love can make you cry like a little bitty child
oh the power of love can make you sad and lonely
or wanna kick up your heels and face the world with a smile
love has the power of a giant with a touch like a feather
love can make your sky turn blue when it's stormy weather
love can make you feel so cold or burn a hole right through your soul
the most powerful thing in the world must be love
oh the power of love...
love can make your whole world shake like a large explosion
or love can leave you quiet and still if it takes a notion
love can take you way up high and make you jump thinkin' you can fly
it's a powerful powerful thing the power of love
oh the power of love...
the most powerful thing in the world must be love
"it's been rough and rocky travelin',"
but i'm finally standin' upright on the ground.
"after takin' several readings,"
i'm surprised to find my mind`s still fairly sound.
"i guess nashville was the roughest,"
but i know i said the same about them all.
we received our education
"in the cities of the nation, me and paul."
"almost busted in laredo,"
"but for reasons that i'd rather not disclose,"
"but if you're stayin' in a motel there and leave,"
just don't leave nothin' in your clothes.
"and at the airport in milwaukee,"
"they refused to let us board the plane at all,"
"they said we looked suspicious,"
but i believe they like to pick on me and paul.
"i guess nashville was the roughest,"
but i know i said the same about them all.
we received our education
"in the cities of the nation, me and paul."
"back home, back home"
"yes, i'm going back home"
why i can't believe it's been this long
since i've seen mom and dad
when i left my mountain home behind
i left them both so sad
my brothers and my sisters that were babies then are grown
"years have past and now at last, i'm on my way back home"
"back home, back home"
yes i'm going back home
"to the factory smoke and city life, i'm sayin' so long"
i've shed a lot of tears through all the years that i've been gone
and i've spent a lot of time a' wishin' i could go back home
i got a letter from mama an'
mama asked me if i'd come back home
she says it sure is lonesome now
since all of us kids are all growed up and gone
i just can't hardly stand the thoughts of
momma and daddy being left there all alone
that's really all i need to know
and now i'm on the road back home
"back home, back home"
"yes, i'm going back home"
"to the smog an' smoke an' city life, i'm sayin' so long"
i've shed a lot of tears through all the years that i've been gone
and i've spent a lot of time a' wishin' i could go back home
"back home, back home"
"yes, i'm going back home"
when you put two and two together
you figure out love's got four letters

running scared
wonderin' what i'm doin' so far from home
beginnin' not to care that i was so alone
then my eyes met hers and without one word
i could tell what was gonna happen
i could feel it in my bones
by the dark o' the moon
there's a fire in the night
she took me to her room
ah ya know it felt so right
the heat's growin' higher
the flame of desire
by the dark o' the moon
"ahh, there's a fire in the night"
when she told me
she didn't often do this kind of thing
she said please hold me
hold me tight so i don't have to think
oh her gentle touch
really moved me so much
the flames of love swept over us
like a burning light

oh yeah
i like an old guitar
playin' a gosdin song
in a smoky bar
"that's what turns me on, yeah"
if that makes me a little old school
go ahead and call me yesterday's old fool
if that makes me a little throwback
"throw it at me, don't worry, i can take that"
"call me hick, hillbilly, hell i'm proud to be what that makes me"
i like a 60's truck
the kind that's solid steel
the kind that always runs
it takes a man to turn that wheel
if that makes me a little old school
go ahead and call me yesterday's old fool
if that makes me a little throwback
"throw it at me, don't worry, i can take that"
"call me hick, hillbilly, hell i'm proud to be what that makes me"
"yeah, i don't swear in front of no woman"
i answer yes sir to my old man
i drink my liquor with a side of nothin'
"yeah, good and country that's what i am"

you oughta go north somebody told us
æ…ause the air is filled with gold dust
and fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
now i donæš° recall you said it
but weæšž lived so long on credit
and so we headed out to find our promised land
just poor appalachian farm folk
with nothing more than high hopes
we hitched our station wagon to a star
but our dreams all fell in on us
'cause there was no land of promise
and itæš¯ a stuggle keepin?sight of who you are
oh and these northern nights are dreary
and my southern heart is weary
i wonder how the old folks are back home
but iæš£l keep leanin?on sweet jesus
i know heæš£l love and guide and lead us
appalachian memories keep me strong
ya know iæš³e been thinkin?a whole lot lately
about whatæš¯ been and what awaits me
it takes all iæš³e got to give what life demands
you go insane if you give in to it
lifeæš¯ a mill and iæš³e been through it
iæš¦ just thankful iæš¦ creative with my hands
oh and these northern nights are dreary
and my southern eyes are teary
donæš° i wonder how the old folks are back home
but iæš£l keep leanin?on my jesus
i know heæš£l love and guide and lead us
appalachian memories keep me strong
iæš£l keep lookin?to the father
keep our heads above the water
appalachian memories keep me strong
she don't like the rain
always makes her sad
the thunder and the lightning reminds her of her dad
today she makes a jailbreak
today she leaves the nest
she's packing up for college
and she picked one out west
she's had enough gray
the clouds need to part
her life's been that way
she needs to recharge
her family's been broken
just like her heart
she's always been scared of the dark
she feels like a solar power girl
she needs to live on the bright side of the world
her mama worked two jobs
raised her all alone
how come superheroes always come from broken homes?
her daddy liked to drink
her daddy liked to swear
best thing he ever did was vanish right into thin air
that supergirl needs sunlight so she gets in her car
she's going somewhere she can feel the earth's closest star
she'll lay down on a blanket 'neath the hollywood sign
and wipe all of this outta her mind
'cause she is a solar power girl
she needs to live on the bright side of the world
yes she's been through the storm
her new life's begun
like a rose 'bout to bloom in the sun
'cause she is a solar power girl
in the dark of the night
she realized
tomorrow the sun's gonna rise
and she is a solar power girl
she needs to live on the bright side of the world
yes she is a solar power girl

"well, in a little bitty nitty gritty one horse town"
right side up or upside down
a tiny piece of paper got stuck to a boot
and it stayed there stuck for about an hour or two
'til the man climbed in his truck and he kicked it loose
yeah and just like that it was back on the move
it got run over thirty-seven times in the street
'til a bird picked it up 'cause it looked like something to eat
but it was finally dropped on the courthouse steps
the breeze started blowing and guess what was next
it blew in a car window gave an old man a scare
caused a six-car pile up on the downtown square
it was floatin' around
high in the air
even if you looked you may not see it there
it's just one of those things
we rarely ever think about
yeah it could come from a hamburger bag or a bubble gum wrapper
it's a day in the life of a little scrap piece of paper
there it goes...here it comes
two people in the shadows where they couldn't be seen
both of them was wearin' someone else's ring
"she said here's my new number, you better write it down"
so he grabbed that piece of paper just a layin' on the ground
"he folded it up, and put it in his jeans"
'til it was found by his wife at her washing machine
"well, she threw it in the trash, yeah she took it out the door"
well that's her job 'cause he don't live there no more
she put it by the curb in a rubber maid bin
'til the neighbour's dog spot knocked it over again
it was set free when the cold wind blew
yeah and just like that it was back on the move
a just a floatin' around
high in the air
even if you looked you may not see it there
it's just one of those things
we rarely ever think about
yeah it could come from a hamburger bag or a bubble gum wrapper
it's a day in the life of a little scrap piece of paper
just a floatin' around
high in the air
even if you looked you may not see it there
it's just one of those things
we rarely ever think about
yeah it could come from a hamburger bag or a bubble gum wrapper
well i'm getting tired now i gotta get some sleep now
i guess i've been worried much too long
so don't wake me till it's over till the need for you is gone
i was so happy before i loved you
i want to be like i was before
so don't wake me till it's over
when i won't want you any more
my mind is gettin' weak now gotta get some sleep now
i gotta rest my achin' head
i just wanna lay here just let me stay here
till the blues get up and leave my bed
good night darling good night darling
good night forever more
and don't wake me till it's over
when i won't want you anymore

well the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
and we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
well we found love and happiness people envy us you see
for we found heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
yes we found what most people are looking for
and it's not a lotta money to spend on real fine car
but it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
and there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33
four thousandth block proves what true love can do
once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
oh all around the house you can see little children play
but they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
they are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
they're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
for look at the house they think there from the sky
they think this place would make them as happy as you and me
and the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4-0-33
four thousandth block proves what true love can do...
and we're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4-0-33
wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had
look into my teardrops and darling you will see
the reflection of an angel that made a fool of me
look into my teardrops and you will see the eyes
that promised me so many things but all of them were lies
look into my teardrops the mirror of my soul
and you will see the girl who stilled my only world but i couldn't hold
look into my teardrops and you will see the one
that broke my heart forever aren't you proud of what you've done
[ ac.guitar ]
look into my teardrops...
just one more dance just one more chance so i can talk to you
we've both have paid don't be afraid just let me try to prove
i would do anything you want me to
just one more dance just one more chance let me talk to you
don't go too far with that crowd at the bar
that's not the way to win let's fall in love again
give me your heart and let me start to build our life anew
just one more dance just one more chance let me talk to you
just one more dance just one more chance let me talk to you
"well i can't tell you where i'm going,"
i'm not sure of where i've been
but i know i must keep travelin'
till my road comes to an end
"i'm out here on my journey,"
trying to make the most of it
"i'm a puzzle, i must figure out"
where all my pieces fit
like a poor wayfaring stranger
that they speak about in song
i'm just a weary pilgrim
trying to find what feels like home
"where that is no one can tell me,"
am i doomed to ever roam
"i'm just travelin', travelin', travelin',"
i'm just travelin' on
"questions i have many, answers but a few"
"but we're here to learn, the spirit burns,"
to know the greater truth
we've all been crucified
and they nailed jesus to the tree
"and when i'm born again,"
you're gonna see a change in me
god made me for a reason
and nothing is in vain
redemption comes in many shapes
with many kinds of pain
"oh sweet jesus if you're listening,"
keep me ever close to you
"as i'm stumblin', tumblin', wonderin',"
as i'm travelin' thru
"i'm just travelin', travelin', travelin',"
i'm just travelin' thru
"i'm just travelin', travelin', travelin',"
i'm just travelin' thru
"oh sometimes the road is rugged,"
and it's hard to travel on
"but holdin' to each other,"
we don't have to walk alone
"when everything is broken,"
we can mend it if we try
"we can make a world of difference,"
if we want to we can fly
"goodbye little children,"
goodnight you handsome men
farewell to all you ladies
and to all who knew me when
"and i hope i'll see you down the road,"
you meant more than i knew
"as i was travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin' thru"
"i'm just travelin', travelin', travelin',"
i'm just travelin'
drifting like a floating boat
and roaming like the wind
"oh give me some direction lord,"
let me lean on you
"as i'm travelin', travelin', travelin',"
thru
"i'm just travelin', travelin', travelin',"
i'm just travelin' thru
"i'm just travelin', travelin', travelin',"
i'm just travelin' thru
like the poor wayfaring stranger
that they speak about in song
i'm just a weary pilgrim
trying to find my own way home
"oh sweet jesus if you're out there,"
keep me ever close to you
"as i'm travelin', travelin', travelin',"
as i'm travelin' thru
i remember the day that clayton delaney died
they said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried
it made a big impression on me although i was a barefoot kid
they said he got religion at the end and i'm glad that he did
clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
i thought he was a hero and i used to follow clayton around
i often wondered why clayton who seemed so good to me
never took his old guitar and made it down in tennessee
well daddy said he drank a lot but i could never understand
i knew he used to picked up in ohio with a five piece band
clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
there ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early gray
i guess if i'd admit it clayton taught me how to drink booze
i can see him half stoned pickin' up the lovesick blues
when clayton died i made him a promise i was gonna carry on somehow
i'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now
i remember the year that clayton delaney died
nobody ever knew it but i went out in the woods and i cried
i know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than i do
but it could be the good lord likes a little picking too
i remember the year that clayton delaney died

the end has come and found us here
with our toys scattered all around us here
the puzzle that we never found an answer for
"still asks us, darlin', just what all the games were for"
and here we stand in a box of sand
where's the playground susie?
you're the one who's supposed to know her way around
where's the playground susie
if i don't stay around?
if i don't stay around?
the carousel has stopped us here
it twirled a time or two and then it dropped us here
and still you're not content with something about me
but what merry-go-round can you ride without me
to take your hand ?
how would you stand?
where's the playground susie
if i decide to let you go and play around?
where's the playground susie
if i don't stay around?
if i don't stay around?
where's the playground susie?
you're the one who's supposed to know her way around
where's the playground susie
if i decide to let you go and play around?
"look under his floorboards, mama"
i don't trust his silly grin
he's got a beat up rambler with nebraska plates
i ain't getting in
i don't like the way his pinky ring
picks up the dashboard light
or his short little piggy fingers
or the way his belt is cinched too tight
"check under his floorboards, mama"
i don't like his suggestive tone
the way the words drip from his mouth
"as he asks, can i take you home"
i don't care how many miles i got
i think i'd rather walk alone
than to sit in the back seat
as his eyes in the mirror
reduce me to flesh and bone
"check under his floorboards, mama"
'cause that razor's not just a threat to me
he'll be slicing tiny crescents from your heart
without laying a sweaty palm on your cheek
don't accuse me of running scared
but listen to what i'm saying
it's a fucked up old world but this ole girl
"well, she ain't giving in"
falling out of love with me
writer dolly parton
copyright 1976
the hardest thing i've ever done or that i'll ever do
was to just walk off and leave you but i knew i had to leave you
cause i couldn't stay and watch you falling out of love with me
the worst pain that i've ever known or that i'll ever know
was to see your love a dying and to have to watch it dying
and i couldn't stand to watch you falling out of love with me
it's hurtin' now but still it's better i left while love was still alive
it was dying and i'd rather i didn't have to watch it die
the deepest hurt i've ever felt or that i'll ever feel
was to know that i was losing and i tried but i kept losing
and i couldn't stay to watch you falling out of love with me
the loneliest i've ever been or that i'll ever be
is now that i'm without you and i feel so lost without you
but i couldn't stay and watch you falling out of love with me
i'm crying now but still it's better i left while love was still alive
but it was dying and i'd rather i didn't have to watch it die
today tomorrow and forever that's how long our love will last
i'll never stop loving you no never today tomorrow and forever
we've got the kind of love most people dream about
we're sure of our love in our mind there's no doubt
and i know that you ove me by the things you do and say
and our love keeps growing stronger day after day
today tomorrow and forever...
each day you let me know just how much you care
and you know if you need me you know i'm always there
you don't have to say you love me over and over again
i know because you show me and i know our love won't end
today tomorrow and forever...
"i'm coming home, i've done my time"
and i've got to know what is and isn't mine
if you've received my letter tellin' you i'd soon be free
then you'll know just what to do if you still want me
if you still want me.
oh tie a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree
"it's been three long years, do you still want me?"
if i don't see a ribbon round the ole oak tree
"i'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me"
if i don't see a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree.
"bus driver please, won't you look for me"
oh 'cause i couldn't bear to see what i might see
"you know, i'm really still in prison"
and my love he holds the key
a simple yellow ribbon's what i need to set me free
and i wrote and i told him please.
honey tie a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree
it's been three long years
and i want to know if you still want me?
if i don't see a ribbon round the ole oak tree
i'll gonna stay on the bus
"> and forget about us, put the blame on me"
if i don't see a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree.
now the whole bus is cheering and i can't believe i see
a hundred yellow ribbons round the ole oak tree
"see that train coming round the bend,"
carrying the one that i love
"her beautiful body is still here on earth,"
but her soul has been called up above
"body and soul, body and soul,"
"that's how she loved me, with body and soul"
"her beautiful hair was the purest of gold,"
"her eyes were as blue as the sea,"
"her lips were the color of summer's red rose,"
and she promised she would always love me
tomorrow as the sun sinks low
the shadows will cover her face
"as her last sun goes down, she's laid beneath the ground"
and my teardrops are falling like rain
left a good job in the city
workin' for the man every night and day
and i never lost one minute of sleepin
worryin' bout the way things
might have been
big wheel keep on turnin'
proud mary keep on burnin'
rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river
cleaned a lot of plates in memphis
pumped a lot of pain down in new orleans
but i never saw the good side of the city until i hitched a ride on a river boat queen
big wheel keep on turnin'...
"rollin`,….."
[ guitar ]
if you come down to the river
bet you gonna find some people who live
you don't have to worry
`cause you have no money
people on the river are happy to give
big wheel keep on turnin'...
rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river
i just took your picture off the table
and i just took your picture off the wall
hide from you anywhere i'm able
but there's one place i can't hide from you at all
"tennessee, you don't make the whiskey"
"california, you don't make the wine"
"and mexico, you don't make tequila"
strong enough to get her off my mind
memories seem to know just where to find me
and lately they're all that i recall
and everything in this old house reminds me
of the love i had and how i lost it all
days go by and i still feel the sorrow
and time don't make a difference in the pain
just sitting here and waiting on tomorrow
will drive me crazy if i don't go insane
strong enough to get her off my mind
strong enough to get her off my mind
"lets all sing together, the internet is forever!"

your grandmother's in an open casket
you're in a suit and shades
"you take your iphone out and you snap it, #sadday"
you oughta be ashamed
"posing in the bathroom mirror, in a skimpy little two piece"
"in the background there's a toddler, cryin' on the toilet seat"
"you oughta be ashamed, of your selfie"
now why you gotta go and tweet it?
when you really oughta just delete it
now we all want to unsee it but we can't
you oughta be ashamed (but you're not)
"spring breakin' in daytona, in the middle of a keg stand"
it's all fun and games 'til your daddy follows you on instagram
"you oughta be ashamed, of your selfie"
you oughta take that stick and break it in half
"show a little sense, show a little class"
you took it of your face but you know you're really showing your ass
go on and take one at the grand canyon
or if you get to meet ringo starr
but if you're texting some girl that you just met
pictures of your little brett favre
"you oughta be ashamed, of your selfie"
"you oughta be ashamed, of your selfie"
"let's all sing together, the internet is forever"
"come on you oughta know better, the internet is forever"
"making out with your professor, the internet is forever"
"naked with an irish setter, the internet is forever"
"smoking in your third trimester, the internet is forever"
"he said his name was heather, the internet is forever"
can that t-shirt get any wetter? the internet is forever
where the hell you get that sweater? the internet is forever

a bad little boy moved into the neighborhood
he won't do nothin' right just a-sittin' got to look so good
he don't wanna go to school and learn to read and write
just sits around the house and plays that rock n' roll music all night
"well, he put thumbtacks on teacher's chair"
put chewing gum in li'l girl's hair
"now junior, behave yourself!"
buys every rock n' roll book on the magazine stand
"every dime that he gets, oh is off to the juke box man"
"well, he worries his teacher till she's a-ready to poop"
from rockin' and a rollin' spinnin' in a hula-hoop
"well, his rock n' roll has gotta stop"
junior's head is hard as rock
"now junior, behave yourself!"
gonna tell your mama you'd better do what she said
get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
you shoot the canary and you fed it to the neighboor's cat
you gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
"well, your mama said it's gotta stop"
junior's head is hard as rock
"now junior, behave yourself!"
the leaves on the tree are turnin' inside out
from the great white north there's a big black cloud
run for shelter if you can
there's a storm in the heartland
we made it through the flood of '93
but this is gonna be the death of me
i can't hide the tears of a desperate man
there's a storm in the heartland
she's leavin' me just like a restless wind
and i can see my world is comin' to an end
like the sounds of thunder empty words ring out again
there's a storm in the heartland
there's a storm in the heartland
the love she gave was like a breath of spring
sweet and pure as a mountain stream
i couldn't see the danger close at hand
there's a storm in the heartland
she's leavin' me just like a restless wind
and i can see my world is comin' to an end
like the sounds of thunder empty words ring out again
there's a storm in the heartland
there's a storm in the heartland
there's a storm in the heartland
sing the wondrous love of jesus
sing his mercy and his grace
in the mansions bright and blessed
he’ll prepare for us a place
when we all get to heaven
what a day of rejoicing that will be
when we all see jesus
we’ll sing and
shout the victory
while we walk the pilgrim pathway
clouds will overspread the sky
but when traveling days are over
not a shadow not a sigh
when we all get to heaven
what a day of rejoicing that will be
when we all see jesus
we’ll sing and shout the victory
onward to the prize before us
soon his beauty we’ll behold
soon the pearly gates will open
we shall tread the streets of gold
when we all get to heaven
what a day of rejoicing that will be
when we all see jesus
we’ll sing and shout the victory
when we all see jesus
we’ll sing and shout the victory
i want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widowed wife
who had a teenage daughter who attended harper valley junior high
well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
she said mom i got a note here from the harper valley p.t.a.
"the note said misses johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high"
it's reported you've been drinking and a runnin' round with men and going wild
and we don't believe you ought to be a bringing up your little girl this way
"it was signed by the secretary, harper valley p.t.a."
"well, it happened that the p.t.a. was gonna meet that very afternoon"
they were sure surprised when misses johnson wore her miniskirt into the
room
and as she walked up to the blackboard i still recall the words she had to say
"she said, i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley"
p.t.a.
"well there's bobby taylor, sitting there and seven times he's asked me for a"
date
misses taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
and mister baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
and shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled
completely down ?
well mister harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed to long at kelly's bar
again
and if you smell shirley tompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of
gin
then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother i'm not fit
well this is just a little peyton place and you're all harper valley
hypocrites
"no, i wouldn't put you on because it really did , it happend just this way"
the day my mama socked it to the harper valley p.t.a.
the day my mama socked it to the harper valley p.t.a.
well i know you hate my drinkin'
and the way i talk sometimes
but you hate it most when i don't call at night
and it's just because you love me
and you worry 'bout your man
you do the best you can with who i am
burnin' both ends of a candle
can leave one in the dark
and i know what i put you through
is hard upon your heart
and it's just that you're concerned for me
"sweetheart, i understand"
you do the best you can with who i am
you go to church on sunday
while i'm still home in bed
sleepin' off the night i had before
and sometimes you say i'm perfect
and sometimes not worth a damn
you do the best you can with who i am
burnin' both ends of a candle
can leave one in the dark
and i know what i put you through
is hard upon your heart
and it's just that you're concerned for me
"sweetheart, i understand"
you do the best you can with who i am
you do the best you can with who i am
tomorrow i'm gonna leave here
i'm gonna let you go and walk away
like every day i said i would
"and tomorrow, i'm gonna listen"
to that voice of reason inside my head
telling me that we're no good
but tonight i'm gonna give in one last time
rock you strong in these arms of mine
forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
we're like fire and gasoline
i'm no good for you
you're no good for me
we only bring each other tears and sorrow
"but tonight, i'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow"
i'll be stronger
i'm not gonna break down and call you up
when my heart cries out for you
"and tomorrow, you won't believe it,"
"but when i pass your house,"
i won't stop no matter how bad i want to.
but tonight i'm gonna give in one last time
rock you strong in these arms of mine
forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
we're like fire and gasoline
i'm no good for you
you're no good for me
we only bring each other tears and sorrow
"but tonight, i'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow"
"baby when we're good, you know we're great"
but there's too much bad for us to think
that there's anything worth trying to save
but tonight i'm gonna give in one last time
rock you strong in these arms of mine
forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
we're like fire and gasoline
i'm no good for you
you're no good for me
we only bring each other tears and sorrow
"but tonight, i'm gonna love you like there's no..."
"tomorrow, i'm gonna leave here."
i'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day i said i would
"jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy"
out in the shack with a blue tick hound
"broke as hell, but blessed with beauty"
the kind that a rich man can't turn down
she caught the eye of an oil man dancing
one summer night in a dime store dress
"she had the looks, he had the mansion"
and you can figure out the rest
"it was all roses, dripping in diamonds"
sipping on champagne
"she was all uptown, wearing that white gown"
taking his last name
"she could hear those church bells ringing, ringing"
"and up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing"
fold your hands and close your eyes
"yeah, it's all gonna be alright"
"and just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing"
"yeah, they're ringing"
jenny was hosting junior league parties
and having dinner at the country club
everyone thought they were ken and barbie
but ken was always getting way too drunk
"saturday night, after a few too many"
he came home ready to fight
and all his money could never save jenny
from the devil living in his eyes
"it was all bruises, covered in makeup"
dark sunglasses
"and that next morning, sitting in the back pew"
praying with the baptist
"she could hear those church bells ringing, ringing"
"and up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing"
fold your hands and close your eyes
"yeah, it's all gonna be alright"
"you just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing"
"yeah, they're ringing"
jenny slipped something in his tennessee whiskey
no law man was ever gonna find
and how he died is still a mystery
but he hit a woman for the very last time
"she could hear those church bells ringing, ringing"
"standing there in a black dress singing, singing"
fold your hands and close your eyes
"yeah, it's all gonna be alright"
"and just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing"
"yeah, they're ringing"
whispering while you cuddle near me

and though we're far apart
i know i'll never be tradin'
my love for her
for anybody else's heart

back to that cherokee strip
and i'll carry her away with me
and straight as an arrow flies
we'll ride to paradise
my sweet little chickadee
my little cherokee maiden and me

saw a man in the movies that didn't have a heart
how i wish i could give him mine
then i wouldn't have to feel it breaking all apart
and this emptiness inside would suit me fine
it's times like these
i wish i were the tin man
you could hurt me all you wanted
and i'd never even know
i'd give anything just to be the tin man
and i wouldn't have a heart and i wouldn't need a soul
i couldn't see your leavin' comin'
you took me by surprise
even now it still seems like a dream
but i know i can't be dreamin'
'cause as i lay down each night
the pain so great that it won't let me sleep
it's times like these
i wish i were the tin man
you could hurt me all you wanted
and i'd never even know
i'd give anything just to be the tin man
and i wouldn't have a heart and i wouldn't need a soul
well i'd give anything just to be the tin man
"cowboys and pioneers, come lend your eyes and ears"
i've got the need to testify
don't try to fill your nest out in the open west
'cuz there's a million ways to die
six bullets in the gut or just a paper cut
too many ways to quantify
they'll cut your ankle off to cure a minor cough
'cuz there's a million ways to die
a million ways to die
it's a hundred and one in the shade of the sun
"if you fall asleep, you fry"
a million ways to die
you can live like a saint but there just really ain't
no avoiding a million ways to die
"smallpox and bigger pox, and deadly tomahawks"
or god forbid you steal a pie
they'll blast you into shards for bein' good at cards
'cuz there's a million ways to die
out on the desert plains it hardly ever rains
and you can hear coyotes cry
they'll eat you up and then they'll shit you out again
'cuz there's a million ways to die
a million ways to die
with a whoosh and a whack there's a knife in your back
'cuz you got a fancy tie
a million ways to die
it's a kick in the pants but you don't have a chance
of escaping a million ways to die
a million ways to die
i've learned to live my life just a little bit lighter
gonna look on the lonely days just a little bit brighter
my heart's been throwed around and it ain't done enough laughin'
what is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
it don't do no good to worry none just turns your hair gray while you're young
love can make you sing start your hands a clappin'
what is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
why you can't never tell when love might find you
it could be miles away or right behind you
some makes you hurt real bad some makes you happy
what is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
don't do no good to worry none...
i had a love one time sent me out on a ledge
well it's fourteen stories high standin' on the edge
i don't want that kind no more to start my world a crackin'
what is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
don't do no good to worry none...
what is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
"hey, baby i just asked your daddy"
if i could take your hand
"he said, ""boy, over my dead body"""
guess i ain't his kinda man
but i love you and you love me
"so, baby i gotta plan"
right below the jackson dam
"hey, they'll be draggin' the river"
catchin' nothin' but an ol' catfish
they'll be draggin' the river
that'll show that son of a bitch
it's been rainin' for the last two weeks
so the water's up good and high
we'll just wait 'til it's good n' late
so there ain't nobody passin' by
i'll call my cousin
he'll pick us up an' take us to the greyhound bus
we'll be standin' in front of that preacher
by the time they're lookin' for us
and they'll be draggin' the river
but they ain't gonna find a thing
they'll be draggin' the river
i'll be wearin' me a diamond ring
"ah, we're gonna show 'em"
i know that it might sound crazy
just a little bit too extreme
but to get some of your sweet lovin'
"baby, i'd do anything"
sooner or later
they'll find my letter sayin' that we're alright
we'll be rockin' at the red roof inn
this time tomorrow night
and they'll be draggin' the river
"sayin', ""lord, what a cryin' shame"""
they'll be draggin' the river
"we'll be runnin', they'll never see it comin'"
they'll be draggin' the river
they'll be draggin' the river
but they ain't gonna find a thing
sorry about callin' your dad a son of a bitch earlier
"hey, do you think he'll still hire me?"
"whoa, that thing's little"
"the diamond, i mean"
i went to sleep last night lonely and blue
tears were falling like the morning dew
but when i closed my eyes my loneliness was gone
cause i dreamed my baby came home
and you were holding me kissing me like you used to do
my heart went crazy when you whispered i love you
yes you were standing there sweet as you could be
like you had never said goodbye to me
for just a little while my loneliness was gone
cause i dreamed my baby came home
i went to sleep last night lonely and blue...
and you were holding me...
yes you were standing there...
tell us once again this morning old friend how did you win the war
everybody loves a hero it don't matter if they've heard the tale before
and tell us of the time when almost everybody knew you were a star
and how intelligent you are
prove that you're alive mr shuck and jive
you can tell us of the man who stole your fortune and nearly ruined your life
or better still the one about the tv and the couch and your best friend's wife
tell us of grand projects never finished with somebody else to blame
and all the reasons that your fame
just never did arrive mr shuck and jive
[ piano ]
if you can get yourself together kindly write a criticism of this song
how it's exquisitely constructed and yet mechanical and somehow slightly wrong
and you can put it in your book about the enemy you never even met
you know you just might make it yet
but somehow you'll survive mr shuck and jive
looks like royal in a thrift store dress
keeps my heart and her hair a mess
"she goes where the wind suggests she goes, who knows"
got a spirit that can't be tamed
she's a calico pony on an open plain
"i know i'll never be the same no more, for sure"
she's a wild child
got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
she can't be tied down but for a while
i'll be falling free and so alive
might break my heart but god she drives me wild child
you've never heard of her favorite band unless you
been to bonnaroo or burning man
"she's penny lane in a chevy van, she loves to love"
she loves me wild child
got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
she can't be tied down but for a while
i'll be falling free and so alive
might break my heart but god she drives me wild child
she'll be here until she runs
some just have to chase the sun
she's a wild child
got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
she can't be tied down but for a while
i'll be falling free and so alive
might break my heart but god she drives me wild child
a kaleidoscope of colors in her mind child
a touch of crazy hides behind her wild smile
so simple yet experimental
innocent but still a little wild child
wild child
it used to be right that you love me you said so and i thought so too
we'd talk maturely bout old puppy love comparing the old with the new
if it so right we love each other than why you had rather be gone
you seem to take pride in deceiving
but when did right become wrong when did right become wrong
norman hamlet
[ steel ] and roy nichols
[ guitar ] you made a good talk about romance you said you just know it when it's real
you sealed your orations with kisses of fire oh darlin' weren't they really real
if it's so right that i hold you then why have i not in so long
for you know i can't even touch you
and when did right become wrong when did right become wrong
**********

a young lady that sings harmony with us on all our records

we're gonna have her do some of those records
and we're gonna do that right now if you'll all get together and welcome
miss bonnie owens out on the bandstand
thank you merle

there are stars in the southern sky
southward as you go
there is moonlight and moss in the trees
--- instrumental ---
"now, i have loved you like a baby"
like some lonesome child
and i have loved you in a tame way
and i have loved you wild.
sometimes there's a part of me
has to turn form here and go
running like a child from these warm stars
there are stars in the southern sky
and if ever you decide you should go
there is a taste of time sweetened honey
(kenny chesney/donny kees/james weatherly)
"honey, i'd love to change your name,"
make yours and mine one in the same.
"aint nothin else about you i'd ever want to change,"
"honey, i'd sure love to change your name."
do you believe in love at first sight?
"i don't think that i did, not until tonight."
"when i saw you dancin' on that hard wood floor,"
"kickin' your heels up, i knew it was love forever more."
"honey, i'd love to change your name,"
make yours and mine one in the same.
"aint nothin else about you i'd ever want to change,"
"honey, i'd sure love to change your name."
"you're probably thinkin i'm some kind of fool,"
"well, your right darlin', i'm a fool for you."
"you buy this line babe; i'll buy you a ring,"
"get on my knees and beg you, please, to marry me."
"honey, i'd love to change your name,"
make yours and mine one in the same.
"aint nothin else about you i'd ever want to change,"
"honey, i'd sure love to change your name."
"honey, i'd love to change your name,"
make yours and mine one in the same.
"aint nothin else about you i'd ever want to change,"
"but, honey, i'd sure love to change your name."
the night that we met i heard music
"the words started coming, so i wrote her a song"
"she loved every line, that flowed from my mouth"
and i sang it to her all night long
it was easy to write about her blue eyes
and her sweet smile and her body
"and her smile oh, touchin' me"
"i made her mine, with just a few lines"
and a three quarter time melody
that's all there is to this song
the dream that she was has moved on
that's all there is to this song
that's all there is to this song
the dream that she was has moved on
and that's all there is to this song
and that's all there is to this song
well i left my home down on a rural route
and i told my folks i'm goin' steppin' out
to get the honky tonk blues the jumpin' honky tonk blues
well lord i got 'em i got the honky tonk blues
in and out of every joint in this town
the city life has really got me down
i got the honky tonk blues the honky tonk blues
well lord i got 'em i got the honky tonk blues
[ guitar ]
i'm gonna slap my boogie underneath my arm
scud right back in my pappy's farm
and lose these honky tonk blues the jumpin' honky tonk blues
well lord i got 'em i got the honky tonk blues
[ steel ]
well i left my home down on a rural route...
when you see a shooting star in the night
when you hear the warm wind whisper through the pines
i want you to know
itâ€™ll be me and my infinite love for you
itâ€™s just like i promised you under heaven above
it will live on long after we kiss goodbye
forever by your side
my infinite love
when you think someone is callinâ€™ out your name
when you feel that kind of feelinâ€™ you canâ€™t explain
now you will know
itâ€™ll be me and my infinite love for you
itâ€™s just like i promised you under heaven above
it will live on long after we kiss goodbye
forever by your side

itâ€™s just like i promised you under heaven above
it will live on long after we kiss goodbye
forever by your side

kiss an angel good mornin
whenever a chance to meet some old friends on the street
they wonder how does a man get to be this way
i always got a smileing face any time and any place
and everytime they ask me why
i just smile and say
you've got to kiss angel good mornin
and let her know you think about her when your gone
so kiss an angel good mornin
and love her like the devil when you get back home
now people may guess the secret of happeniness
some of them never learn
it's a simple thing
the secret i'm speaking of
is a woman and a man in love
and the anwser is in this song that i always sing
you got to kiss an angel good mornin
and let her know you think about her when your gone
so kiss an angel good mornin
and love her like the devil when you get back home
kiss an angel good mornin
and let her know you think about her when your gone
so kiss an angel good mornin
and love her like the devil when you get back home.
american pride something you feel inside
something you can't describe american pride
"dad said, ""son i'm proud you won"
"but the game is more than any toy"""
"mama said, ""now son say sir and say ma'am"
"and be proud you're southern born"""
you play when you're hurt and you work when you're tired
'cause that was grandpa's way
and the biscuits are better at granny's house
and the gravy taste great all day
american pride yes it is something you feel inside
"soemthing you can't describe, something you cannot hide"
american pride something you feel inside
traditions run deep and wide with american pride
when a baby is born we all celebrate
with tears of joy in family eyes
'cause we all know the baby will grow up with american pride
yeah we work and we play and we have our own ways
and we don't all look alike
but if the cause is right we stand up and fight
to protect our american pride
"sing it, sing it, sing it"
american pride yes it is something you feel inside
"it's something you can't describe, it's something you can't hide"
american pride something you feel inside
traditions run deep and wide with american pride
"with american pride, it's american pride"
(billy ray cyrus/michael joe sagraves/don von tress)
little boy running through the yard
fell and skinned his heart
and later climbed up in a tree
"as he looked into the sky,"
he began to cry
"and said, ""daddy why'd you leave?"""
"call me daddy, i'm feelin' blue"
"call me daddy, i need to talk to you"
"call me daddy, help me through"
and then he bowed his head to pray
"""call me dad"""
the little boy became a man
found a bride and took her hand
and made a baby all their own
"as he looked in that baby's eyes,"
as the baby cried
"he swore, ""you'll never be alone"""
call me daddy when you're feelin' blue
call me daddy and i'll talk to you
call me daddy and i'll help you through
and then he bowed his head to pray
"""call me dad"""
another life has come and gone
another baby's grown
and stands alone against the world
"as he looks into the sky,"
he begins to cry
"and says, ""daddy i miss you"""
"call me daddy, i'm feelin' blue"
"call me daddy, i need to talk to you"
"call me daddy, help me through"
and then he bowed his head to pray
"""call me dad"""
girl i know you had a long day
you ain't feelin' them downtown lights
but i got a bottle at your favorite place
just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice
"damn, i didn't think it'd be that easy"
'cause now you're gettin' ready
i'm just sittin' there watchin' tv
here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
"damn, i can't believe, i can't believe"
"i talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on"
your playlist you play when you're in the shower
talked you into taking up my time
making up your mind
switching back and forth for an hour
and now you're lookin' like a line from a vandross song
i'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
"don't get me wrong, girl, i love it"
now i just wanna talk you out of it
"yeah, as cool as it would be"
watchin' people wonder who you are
"oh, we should just say we did"
we can start with a kiss
and pretend we just got back from the bar
"i talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on"
your playlist you play when you're in the shower
talked you into taking up my time
making up your mind
switching back and forth for an hour
and now you're lookin' like a line from a vandross song
i'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
"don't get me wrong, girl, i love it"
now i just wanna talk you out of it
"yeah, it's a little cold outside"
music's probably way too loud
to hear you laugh
and there's a look in your eyes
looks like we ain't leavin' now
"girl, i'm so glad, i'm so glad"
"i talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on"
your playlist you play when you're in the shower
talked you into taking up my time
making up your mind
switching back and forth for an hour
and now you're lookin' like a line from a vandross song
i'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
"don't get me wrong, girl, i love it"
now i just wanna talk you out of it
the first time i saw you
you were waitin' tables at the corner diner
i said to myself
never seen a woman look any finer
from that moment on
i was stone cold gone
you wuld be forever in my mind
now somewhere in the neon lights
i'm holdin' on for dear life
rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
it was san francisco
silly sutis and white ties by the bay
you appeared with your papa
tears were rolin' down your mother's face
everyone was happy
showered by well wishers as we drove away
now somewhere in the neon lights
i'm holdin' on for dear life
rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
i'm living but dying
i'm laughing but crying
somebody tell me it will be alright
i bought it for your birthday
god you looked so lovely in that dress
i took you to a party
or was it to a night club i forget
been twenty years and counting
i'm drowning in your love a little more each day
now somewhere in the neon lights
i'm holdin' on for dear life
rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
now somewhere in the neon lights
i'm holdin' on for dear life
rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
all your pretty bags are packed
forever sure did go by fas
i hope you find the skies are blue
the grass is green and the road is smooth
"you go your way, c'est la vie sweet baby"
here's hoping that you don't hate me
who knows you might just maybe miss me out there
it ain't about who's right or wrong
love dies and life goes on
had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
you go your way and i'll go crazy
i poured some bourbon in a coffee cup
it's been too long since i drank too much
so here's to me and here's to the moon
and here's to love that ends too soon
"you go your way, c'est la vie sweet baby"
here's hoping that you don't hate me
who knows you might just maybe miss me out there
it ain't about who's right or wrong
love dies and life goes on
had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
you go your way and i'll go crazy
yeah it ain't about who's right or wrong
love dies and life goes on
had a good thing but now it's long gone baby
you go your way and i'll go crazy
i'll go crazy
blue skies smilin' at me
nothin' but blue skies do i see
bluebirds singin' a song
nothin' but bluebirds all day long
never saw the sun shinin' so bright
never saw things goin' so right
noticing the days hurrying by
"when you're in love, my how they fly"
"blue days, all of them gone"
nothin' but blue skies from now on
(blue skies smilin' at me
nothin' but blue skies do i see)
never saw the sun shinin' so bright
never saw things goin' so right
noticing the days hurrying by
"when you're in love, my how they fly"
"blue days, all of them gone"
nothin' but blue skies from now on
nothin' but blue skies from now on
here we go again
she's back in town again
i'll take her back again
one more time
here we go again
the phone will ring again
i'll be her fool again
one more time
"i've been there , before"
"and i'll try it , again"
but any fool knows
that there's no way to win
here we go again
she'll break my heart again
i'll play the part again
one more time
"i've been there , before"
"and i'll try it , again"
but any fool knows
that there's no way to win
here we go again
she'll break my heart again
i'll play the part again
one more time
i'll take her back again
tonight down here in the valley
i'm lonesome and oh how i feel
as i sit here alone in my cabin
i can see your mansion on the hill
do you recall when we parted
the story to me you revealed
"you said you could live without love, dear"
in your loveless mansion on the hill
"i've waited all through the years, love"
to give you a heart true and real
because i know that you're living in sorrow
in your loveless mansion on the hill
the light shines bright from your window
and the trees stand so silent and still
"i know you're alone with your pride, dear"
in your loveless mansion on the hill
in your loveless mansion on the hill

just another bar
with loud guitars
smoke and candles burning low
and the same ol' boys
their backs to the bar
staring across a crowded floor
then i hear a familiar sound
your voice laughing out loud
from a distance i can see you
dancing slowly with somebody new
but i can't hold you like i want to
but i can love you from a distance
so i take a chair
in a corner somewhere
you can't see me
but i can look at you
and i remember those times
when i looked in your eyes
the way that he now looks at you
deep down i know it's over
but it hurts me when he's so much closer
from a distance i can see you
dancing slowly with somebody new
but i can't hold you like i want to
but i can love you from a distance
and if i can't hold you near me
i'll just hold onto your memory
from a distance i can see you
dancing slowly with somebody new
but i can't hold you like i want to
but i can love you from a distance
i'll always love you from a distance
intro:
like the morning sun
his love moved across every inch of my body
and the heat from the fire burned me up with desire
i thought i'd died and gone to heaven for sure
this morning when i opened my eyes
there to my surprise
lay that angel i thought had been only a dream
and so i said a little prayer
"and thanked god, that he was there"
"oh, this is a dream come true"
dream do come true
i know 'cause i found you
i never thought they did
but now i do
dreams do come true
it was love at first sight
and it was love all night
and the way he made love to me
fulfilled all my fantasies
"ooo, this is a dream come true"
"yes, dreams do come true"
i know 'cause i found you
i never thought they did
but you're living proof
that dreams do come true
tag:
dreams do come true
and i am so in love with you
come on back jesus (come on back jesus)

and pick up john wayne on the way
"the world's done gone crazy,"
and it seems to get worse everyday
"so come on back jesus,"
and pick up john wayne on the way
time to take off the glove
they just don't respect peace anymore
but if we have old john wayne
we know he can swing from the floor
while he kicks their butt
we'll just stand there and watch him and pray
"so come on back jesus,"
and pick up john wayne on the way
come on back jesus (come on back jesus)
come on back jesus
and pick up john wayne on the way
"the world's gettin' crazy,"
and it seems to get worse everyday
"so come on back jesus,"
and pick up john wayne on the way

if only old duke man was here
he'd call me old bastard
from out past the atmosphere
lord the news looked so scary
when i glanced at the paper today
"so come on back jesus,"
and pick up john wayne on the way
come on back jesus (come on back jesus)

and pick up john wayne on the way
"the world's gettin' crazy,"
and it seems to get worse everyday
"so come on back jesus,"
and pick up john wayne on the way
"come on back jesus, come on back jesus"

and pick up john wayne on the way
words and music by mac mcanally and robert byrne
"he was a good time, beer bar picker until the night she came along."
"he gave up his women and his liquor, and she put the sad in all his songs."
something about hermade him sorry.
she was holy in his eyes. she had him bound and hypnotized.
she put the sad in all his songs. she put the blues in his guitar.
she took what he had and she made it wrong.
she put the sad in all his songs.
she was the rattle snake that bit him.
she was the blow fromup behind.
"she thought the tear in his eye just might fit him, and he was the last thing"
on her mind.
she put the sad in all his songs. she put the blues in his guitar.
she took what he had and she made it wrong.
she put the sad in all his songs.
she put the sad in all his songs.
i know you won't
"i know you don't mean to be, mean to me"
cause when you want to you can make me feel like we belong
we belong...
"lately, you make me feel all i am is a backup plan"
i say i'm done and then you smile at me and i forget
everything i said...
i buy into those eyes and into your lies
"you say you'll call, but i know you"
"you say you're coming home, but i know you"
"you say you'll call, but i know you won't."
"you say you'll call, but i know you won't."
i wish you were where you're supposed to be
close to me
but here i am just starin' at this candle burnin' out
still no sound
of footsteps on my stairs
or your voice anywhere
"you say you'll call, but i know you"
"you say you're coming home, but i know you"
"you say you'll call, but i know you won't."
"you say you'll call, but i know you won't."
"you say you'll call, but i know you"
"you say you're coming home, but i know you"
"you say you'll call, but i know you won't."
"you say you'll call, but i know you won't."
"you say you'll call, but i know you won't."
you can't reach me anymore
you say i'm not the girl that you remember
you say that i hve changed so much and you can't seem to rach me
well you destroyed everything i used to be before and you can't reach me anymore
i was looked up to you while you were looking down
it used to turn me off inside when you would turn me down
now you want the love from me that you destroyed before
but you can't reach me anymore
now you say you love me more than anything
i used to love you that way now i don't feel a thing
the love that once lived in my heart don't live there anymore
and you can't reach me anymore
i was looked up to you while you were looking down
it used to turn me off when you would turn me down
love that once lived in my heart it don't live there anymore
and you can't reach me anymore oh oh oh no you can't reach me anymore
your strange love was what i found
the day the rains came down
and i remember we found shelter in the cave
with the rain clouds up above
in the darkness we found love
the day the rains came i became your slave
as the rains made rivers swell i fell deeper in your spell
you took my hand and handed me a crown
if i could just live on with these things i have known
i know that i'd be glad of what i've found
as the rains made rivers swell i fell deeper in your spell
you took my hand and handed me a crown
but if i could just live on with these things i have known
i know that i'd be glad of what i''ve found
your strange love was what i found
(fade) the day the rains came down
"alone in a booth, in the pioneer cafe"
"i'm strung out from the road, a pillow in my hands"
i sip the last straw from a cold cup of coffee
and try to sort out my feelings as good as i can
two hours behind me theres a boy back in dallas
my phone will be ringing his afternoon call
"but he'll get no answer, the queens left her palace"
shes alone in a cafe in witchita falls
back out on the highway towards oklahoma
i'm driving and crying and hating it all
this old chevroley is raising the sunset
and taking me further from witchita falls
i dont know where i'm going i have no direction
and all i can say is i've made up my mind
i just want to travel a long way from heartache
wherever it takes me i'll leave it behind
i guess that he thought i would stay there forever
living my life with my back to the wall
well maybe the waitress will send him that letter
i left on the table in witchita falls
i'm going somewhere other than texas
a long way from dallas in witchita falls
i'm taking the highway yeah i'm going somewhere
"oh, southern breeze"
knock me to my knees
i believe you're the only one who can
the religious and the rest
they've all tried their best
well i guess some things
you just don't understand
"oh lord, when will the road run out"
i'm on the road but i'm in doubt
and i don't know why
still i second guess my pace
if i stand to lose from winning
to find the truth i'm willing
to start back at the beginning
of the good ol' days
the good ol' days
"oh, southern pines"
reaching for the sky
i'm convinced that i can fly
beneath your shade
"oh, and its all overdue"
spending time just me and you
"mm, the pulpit and pew where i was saved"
"oh lord, when will the road run out"
i'm on the road but i'm in doubt
and i don't know why
still i second guess my pace
if i stand to lose from winning
to find the truth i'm willing
to start back at the beginning
of the good ol' days
the good ol' days

i know that sometimes i'm difficult sometimes i'm crazy
i'm like a storm that keeps blowing your way
and i know it's not fair i can't think of a reason to hurt you this way
words i don't mean cause you sadness
things that i've done to encourage this madness
made a fool of myself love's not supposed to happen this way
shades of blue covering you and turning your sunshine to rain
i keep depending on you to carry me through and color my shades of blue

how many times will you forgive me how many storms still lie within me
say you'll always be there to pick up the pieces of this broken man
when it's all over the air is so still i'm left all by myself and this chill that i feel
when i look in your eyes love's not supposed to happen this way

i saw grandma yesterday down at the store
well she's really doing fine for eighty-four
and she asked me if sometime i could fix her barn
the poor old girl she needs a hand to run that farm

it's the sweetest sound these ears have ever known
it's just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
country comfort and a truck that's goin' back home
oh it's goin' back home
down at the well they've got a new machine
the foreman says it'll cut manpower by fifteen
"""hey but that ain't natural"" old clay would say"
you see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day
country comfort and a truck that's goin' back home
"whoa, it's goin' back home"
hey take me back home

who can i count on
if i can't count on you
i never counted on you
makin' me blue
they say your a runnin' 'round
with somebody new
who can i count on
if i can't count on you
i thought i held a precious key to heaven
your love was sweet and gentle at the start
but now i feel that i can't go on livin'
if livin' means that we must live apart
who can i count on
if i can't count on you
there goes my happiness
and here comes the blues
i can't convince myself that
we're really thru
who can i count on
if i can't count on you
the door to happiness was almost open
just one more step or two and i'd be in
then all at once the vows you made were broken
the door to happiness was closed again
who can i count on
if i can't count on you
there goes my happiness
and here comes the blues
i can't convince myself
that we're really thru
who can i count on
if i can't count on you

if you're gonna play in texas (you gotta have a fiddle in the band)
(dan mitchell/murray kellum)
"if you're gonna play in texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band"
"that lead guitar is hot but not for ""louisiana man"""
"so rosin up that bow for ""faded love"" and let's all dance"
"if you're gonna play in texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band"
i remember down in houston we were puttin' on a show
"when a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled, ""cotton-eyed joe""!"
"he said, ""we love what you're doin', boys don't get us wrong"
"there's just somethin' missin' in your song"""
"if you're gonna play in texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band"
"that lead guitar is hot but not for ""louisiana man"""
"so rosin up that bow for ""faded love"" and let's all dance"
"if you're gonna play in texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band"
so we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight
them texans raised the roof when jeff opened up his case
you say y'all all wanna two-step
you say ya wanna doe-si-doe
"well, here's your fiddlin' song before we go"

"my child arrived just the other day,"
he came to the world in the usual way.
"but there were planes to catch, and bills to pay."
he learned to walk while i was away.
"and he was talking 'fore i knew it, and as he grew,"
"he'd say, ""i'm gonna be like you, dad."
"you know i'm gonna be like you."""
"and the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,"

my son turned ten just the other day.
"he said, ""thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play."
"can you teach me to throw?"" i said, ""not today,"
"i got a lot to do."" he said, ""that's ok."""
"and he walked away, but his smile never dimmed,"
"said, ""i'm gonna be like him, yeah."

"so much like a man i just had to say,"
"""son, i'm proud of you. can you sit for a while?"""

i've long since retired and my son's moved away.
i called him up just the other day.
"i said, ""i'd like to see you if you don't mind."""
"he said, ""i'd love to, dad, if i could find the time."
"you see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu,"
"but it's sure nice talking to you, dad."
"it's been sure nice talking to you."""
"and as i hung up the phone, it occurred to me,"
he'd grown up just like me.
my boy was just like me.

i've been your hound
but now i'm breaking this chain
too late to throw me a bone
i'm sick of fetching and sleeping in the rain
ole sparky's hittin' the road.
i won't be howlin' 'round your house
won't be scratchin' your door
won't be howlin' 'round your house
ain't your dog no more.
i graduated from obedience school
i'd roll and sit when i was told
"woke up hungry, went searchin' for some food"
some other rover's at the dog food bowl.
i won't be howlin' 'round your house
won't be scratchin' your door
won't be howlin' 'round your house
ain't your dog no more.
the pack you found me with
was bayin' at the moon
i begged to follow you home
"tonight i heard 'em, they was playin' my tune"
"don't bother callin' girl, i'm dog gone."
i won't be howlin' 'round your house
won't be scratchin' your door
won't be howlin' 'round your house
ain't your dog no more.
won't be howlin' 'round your house
ain't your dog no more
i ain't your dog no more ...
i work down at the pizza pit
and i drive an old hyundai
i still live with my mom and dad
i’m five foot three and overweight
i’m a sci: fi fanatic mild asthmatic
never been to second base
but there’s a whole ‘nother me
that you need to see

‘cause online i’m out in hollywood
i’m six foot five and i look damn good
i drive a maserati
i’m a black belt in karate
and i love a good glass of wine

i tell ‘em i don’t want nothing serious
‘cause even on a slow day i can have a three-way chat
with two women at one time
i’m so much cooler online
i’m so much cooler online
i get home i kiss my mom
and she fixes me a snack
i head down to my basement bedroom
and fire up my mac
in real life the only time
i’ve ever even been to l.a.
was when i got the chance with the marching band
to play tuba in the rose parade •• but online i live in malibu
i pose for calvin klein i’ve been in gq
i’m single and i’m rich
and i got a set of six-pack abs that would blow your mind
it turns girls on that i’m mysterious
i tell ‘em i don’t want nothing serious
‘cause even on a slow day i can have a three-way chat
with two women at one time • i’m so much cooler online
"yeah, i’m cooler online"

her momma's still got that sequin gown that she wore in '68
she taught her early how to smile that smile and wave from the parade
it took a whole lot of years and tears
for her momma to finally admit
no matter how many stitches and pins
that old dress was never gonna fit
she was daddy's little girl
momma's little angel
"teacher's pet, pageant queen"
"she said ""all my life i've been pleasin' everyone but me,"
"living someone else's dream"""
"her daddy used to say, ""you'll make a lovely bride someday"
"he'll ride up on big white horse and just carry you away"""
it took twenty-five years and some broken vows
before they'd finally see
there's a little more to love and life
then fairy tales and hand me down dreams
she was daddy's little girl
momma's little angel
"teacher's pet, pageant queen"
"she said ""all my life i've been pleasin' everyone but me,"
"living someone else's dream"""
now she's got twenty-seven candles on her cake
and she means to make her life her own
before there's twenty-eight
she was daddy's little girl
momma's little angel
"teacher's pet, pageant queen"
"she said ""all my life i've been pleasin' everyone but me,"
"living someone else's dream"""
she was daddy's little girl
momma's little angel
"teacher's pet, pageant queen"
"she said ""all my life i've been pleasin' everyone but me,"
"little by little, now babe"
"i've come a long, long way"
picking up the pieces
that you threw away
did you give it up?
did i let you down?
"either way, it doesn't matter"
cause i'm finally comin' 'round
i hope you find where you belong
hello - goodbye
life goes on
"in another town, in a little place"
looking in the eyes of a pretty face
i ain't no fool
i know what she's thinkin'
i can hold her in my arms
"but, i could never let her stay"
"cause, love"
your sweet love
still gets in the way
minute by minute
i hear the voice in my heart
"be a man, take her hand"
and make a new start
"so, i think a little less"
i drink a little more
"cause, all in all she's everything"
that i've been waiting for
she smiles that smile
i face the fact
love's a give and take thing
and i can't give it back
i want to be free from the noise of the grind
so i live on the outskirts of the back of my mind
with a strong hand a songman and god on my side
i'm writing that freedom a line at a time
on the highway to nowhere that runs through my mind
a yellow line stretches out into the night
broken in places it's my guiding light
so i'm writing that freedom a line at a time
i'm walking a fine line between wrong and right
i can live with the problems of this day and time
consider me lucky cause i'll be all right
in my mind i'm having a beautiful life
i'm lost in the feelings of this heart of mine
in search of the border of infinite time
and i find peace of mind in the songs and their rhymes
so i'm writing my freedom a line at a time
as i look in the mirror this morning
on some dirty old restroom wall
it took a while to realize it's really me there inside
'cause i've aged twenty years in five.
i recall when i looked much younger
and it wasn't so long ago
but one night of drinking to four nights of wine
and you'll age twenty years in five.
i've aged twenty years in five
i've seen the dark side of life
from a mansion on a hill
to straight whiskey from a still
and you'll age twenty years in five.
before the bottle i played my music
on the road with a five piece band
and with the pressures of the game
i drank up fortune and fame
and i aged twenty year in five.
"oh, but i'll change this way i've been living"
or i'll be gone before my time
i'll climb back to the top
and with my friends i won't stop
till i erase twenty years in five.
"yes, i'll erase twenty years in five..."
we didn't know that times were lean
round our house the grass was green
it didn't seem like things were all that bad
i bet we walked a thousand miles
chopin' cotton and pushin' plows
and learnin' how to give it all we had.
as life went on and years went by
i saw the light in daddy's eyes
and felt - the love in mama's hands
they kept us warm and kept us fed
taught us how to look ahead
"now lookin' back, i understand."
we were walkin' in high cotton
old times there are not forgotten
those fertile fields are never far away
we were walkin' in high cotton
old times there are not forgotten
leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.
when sunday mornings rolled around
we dressed up in hand-me downs
"just in time, together with the church"
sometimes i think how long it's been
and how it impressed me then
it was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.
we were walkin' in high cotton.
there's one more sip in this bottle of wine
a lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
and it's yours if you want it
and this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
a real slow dance in the moonlight dark
this hand in my pocket
"oh baby, just call it"
cause it's yours if you want it
"and every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart"
that's been waitin' on a girl like you
i know it ain't much
but it comes alive with every touch
every kiss already feels like you own it
baby it's yours if you want it
half of this rickety front porch swing
every word of every song i sing
my jacket when it's cold
"oh baby, don't you know"
you've got a place to lay your head
on the other side of my empty bed
and it's just made for fallin'
and it's yours if you want it
it's yours if you want it
"and every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart"
that's been waitin' on a girl like you
i know it ain't much
but it comes alive with every touch
every kiss already feels like you own it
baby it's yours if you want it
it's yours if you want it
"every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing i could beg, steal, or borrow"
every yesterday and tomorrow
well every grain of sand on the beach
every blade of grass under our feet
baby your name is written on it
and it's yours if you want it
"and every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart"
that's been waitin' on a girl like you
and i know it ain't much
but it comes alive with every touch
every kiss already feels like you own it
baby it's yours if you want it
"every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing"
"that i could beg, steal, or borrow"
baby your name is written on it
baby it's yours if you want it
living on free food tickets
water in the milk from a hole in the roof
where the rain came through
what can they do?
tears from your baby sister
crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch
for the party to go
but you know she'll get by
because she is living in the love of the common people
smiles from the heart of a family man
daddy's buying you a dream to cling to
mummy's gonna love her just as much as she can
and she can
it's a good thing you don't have bus fair
it would fall through the hole in your pocket
and you'd loose it on the snow on the ground
walking to town to find a job
trying to keep your hands warm
but the hole in the shoe lets the snow come through
and it chills to the bone
you better go home where it's warm
and you can live in the love of the common people
smiles from the heart of a family man
daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
mummy's gonna love you just as much as she can
and she can
living on dreams ain't easy
but the closer the knit the tighter the fit
and the chill stay away
"you take them in stride, family pride"
you know faith is your foundation
with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
and many a prayer
making you strong where you belong
living in the love of the common people
smiles from the heart of a family man
daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
mummy's gonna love you just as much as she can
living in the love of the common people
smiles from the heart of a family man
daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
mummy's gonna love you just as much as she can
we stood there in the courthouse room
"so close yet far apart,"
you had brought your lawyer
"and i'd brought a broken heart,"
the judge pronounced the words
"the way you wanted him to do,"
"and changed your name from brown to jones,"
and mine from brown to blue.
"i couldn't keep my tears from falling,"
"on the courtroom floor,"
"by law, they took away my rights,"
"to love you anymore,"
"my world just seemed to stop,"
"while i stood there so close to you,"
"they changed your name from brown to jones,"
and mine from brown to blue.
the judge forgot to tell me
"how i'd live my life alone,"
what i would do without you
"after loving you so long,"
he didn't seem to care that
"i am still in love with you,"
"he changed your name from brown to jones,"
and mine from brown to blue.
"i couldn't keep my tears from falling,"
"on the courtroom floor,"
"by law, they took away my rights,"
"to love you anymore,"
"my world just seemed to stop,"
"while i stood there so close to you,"
"they changed your name from brown to jones,"
and mine from brown to blue...
i have chased after rainbows
i've captured one or two
i've reached for the stars
and i have even held a few
i've walked that lonesome valley
"topped the mountains, sewed a sky"
i've laughed and i have cried
but i have always tried
'cause i've always been a dreamer
and dreams are special things
but dreams are of no value
if they're not equipped with wings
so secure yourself for climbing
make ready for the sky
don't let your chance go by
you'll make it if you try
so try to be the first one up the mountain
the highest flying dreamer in the sky
and try your best to be an inspiration
brothers that are still afraid and shy
and try to make the most of every moment
'cause if you never try you never win
so try each day to try a little harder
"and if you fail, get up and try again"
you know nothing is impossible
if you can just believe
don't live your life in shackles
when faith can be the key
the winner's one who keeps determination in his eyes
who's not afraid to fly and not afraid to try
so try to be the first one up the mountain
and try to be the first to touch the sky
"and don't let somebody tell you, you can't do it"
"and if they say that, show em it's a lie"
and if you fail at first just keep on trying
'cause you are not a failure in god's eyes
so spread your wings and let the magic happen
'cause you'll never really know if you don't try
and the first step is the one that's always hardest
but you'll never really know if you don't try
you have to try
(anna lisa graham/walt aldridge)
it's been a while since she heard him say
see you tonight his usual way
there's always some place he's gotta go
somewhere he needs to be
and it's not the same now when they touch
but she figures he's just working too much
somehow that makes it all okay
and gets her through another day
she's heard the talk all over town
but she don't wanna believe he's runnin' around
deep down in her heart she's willing to bet
oh but she ain't seen nothin' yet
she wouldn't read that heart shaped note
she found in the pocket of his coat
that time in the car she found an earring
you know that doesn't prove a thing
she's heard the talk all over town
but she don't wanna believe he's runnin' around
deep down in her heart she's willing to bet
oh but she ain't seen nothin' yet
he's not the same man that she met
oh but she ain't seen nothin' yet
she thinks it's as bad as it's gonna get
i'm so ashamed of my eyes cause they still cry for you
after they both watched my hand wave goodbye to you
i've told them time and time again that this will never do
and i've told them how you always laughed at teardrops
i'm so ashamed of my arms for missing you
last night i woke up just in time to see them reach for you
and now my heart confesses it's still wants you too
i'm so ashamed of them all for loving you
if you see your brother standing by the road
with a heavy load from the seeds he's sowed
and if you see your sister falling by the way
just stop and stay you're going the wrong way
you got to try a little kindness
yes show a little kindness
just shine your light for everyone to see
and if you try a little kindness
then you'll overlook the blindness
of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets
don't walk around the down and out
lend a helping hand instead of doubt
and the kindness that you show every day
will help someone along their way
you got to try a little kindness
yes show a little kindness
just shine your light for everyone to see
and if you try a little kindness
then you'll overlook the blindness
of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets
you got to try a little kindness
yes show a little kindness
just shine your light for everyone to see
and if you try a little kindness
then you'll overlook the blindness
six more days and i'll be gone
get on the train that'll take me home
that old train is where i belong
home's gonna feel just fine
when that old trains gonna move me down the line
yes i know him and you do too
there's a lot he can do for you
looking down from on his throne
gonna make you feel alright
just let him keep his arms around you tight
instrumental
he gave this world to you and me
we're going fishing in the creek
so find yourself a little girl
the world's gonna be alright
just keep you arms around each other tight

i remember the windows rolled down and the wind in my hair
driving 'round in your daddy's old chevy
like we were going somewhere
we thought that summer would last us forever
going steady was just something you do
i didn't know much about love
i learned that from you
now those were some good times
lately they don't seem to last
i guess i'm not nearly as strong as a drink in your glass
and the nights just get later
i can stay up and wait or just go on to bed like i do
i never knew nothing about lonely
i learned from that you
and i learned how to kiss on a ferris wheel
and i made wishes at wishing wells
and i fell into that fairytale too
and i know that love ain't so easy
"but we tried, didn't we baby"
it's alright
some dreams weren't meant to come true
i learned that from you
one night while the whole world was turning
i left you a note
and i told you that i'd always miss you
then i let you go
i'm living outside of some town i ain't heard of
and i think about the boy i knew
i didn' t know you could fall out of love
i learned that from you
and i learned how to kiss on a ferris wheel
and i made wishes at wishing wells
and i fell into that fairytale too
and i know that love ain't so easy
"but we tried, didn't we baby"
it's alright
some dreams weren't meant to come true
i learned that from you
i remember the windows rolled down
see the girl at the table sipping on wine
would you believe that once she was mine
oh lord how she loved me and never complained
while doing without for my foolish dream
she found some rainbows i couldn't see
while she learn to do without so many things
she's slowly learning to do without me
she's learning the ways talk of wild side of life
some stranger would hold her for the first time tonight
while she learn to do without so many things
now she's slowly learning to do without me
[ guitar - steel ]
she did without diamonds on her wedding band
but she could not do without the love of her man
while she learn to do without so many things
she's slowly learning to do without me
while she learn to do without so many things
she's slowly learning to do without me

"well, if that's the case, that's the case"

"well, i got my shotgun, i broke down"
i started to mow that man down
"yeah, they tell me god forgives you"
"if that's the case now, people"

"you don't put yourself out, you don't put yourself out"
"you don't treat margo right, you don't treat margo right"

"no, i'll never, i'll never get out of these blues alive"

(___) to the day i die
well i'm longing to ride on a freight train put a slouch hat down low on my ears
i'm yearning to leave this old town
on the flight and loose all my troubles and cares
in this day of airplanes and highways
hey the slow way is sometimes the best
i'm longing to ride on a freight train
and be a good old american guest
yes i wanna live on the land that
i've loved and i've labored for
and spend a few days headed west
i'm longing to ride on a freight train
and be a good old american guest
well the pressures of life they got to me
and they got down and deep in my soul
i'm tired of the rat-race
wanna go back to the slow pace
and hear a fast train rattle and roll
i wanna live out my days like a hobo
and take myself that long-needed rest
"hey, hey i'm longing to ride on a freight train"
and be a good old american guest
yes i wanna live on the land that
i've loved and i've labored for
and spend a few days headed west
i'm longing to ride on a freight train
and be a good old american guest
"oh, yes i'm longing to ride on a freight train"
and be a good old american guest

"the first scene was the church, then the altar"
"where we claimed each other, with tears of joy we cried"
our friends wished us luck there forever
"as we walked from the church, side by side"
the next scene was a crowded courtroom
and like strangers we sat side by side
then i heard the judge make his decision
and no longer were we man and wife
i hate the sight of that courtroom
where man-made laws push god's laws aside
then the clerk wrote our story in the record
"a church, a courtroom and then goodbye"
we walked from that courtroom together
we shook hands and once again we cried
then it was the end of our story
"a church, a courtroom and then goodbye"

looking through these old photographs
don't they bring some good memories back
some of them make us laugh
and some make us cry
i'm glad we've kept all of these souvenirs
to prove that our love was here
look at how happy we were
pictures don't lie
if forever should end today
and there's no tomorrow for us
what a day yesterday was
here's one of us with you calm and cool
but look at me acting a fool
and here's one of us on the ferris wheel
at the fair
"hey, haven't we had some fun"
the best may be yet to come
we may have a hundred years
still left to share
but...
let's close this book of photographs
and let's turn out the lights
and love for the moment
as if it were the last
if i had one wish
i would wish for two
for me and you
to be happy
with the way things are
sometimes it gets hard
but we've come so far
to be happy
yeah i dont think that im complaining
sometimes it keeps on raining
oh but dont be frightened by thunder and lightning
the sun comes out and the flowers grow
and you find you're already on the road
to be happy
if i had one prayer
to pull out of thin air
"everyone, everywhere,"
would be happy
we'd hand out valentines
"i'd be yours, you'd be mine"
"there's a place, there's a time"
to be happy
"oh, i dont think that im complaining"
sometimes it keeps on raining
oh but dont be frightened by thunder and lightning
the sun comes out and the flowers grow
and you find you're already on the road
to be happy
yeah we fuss and we fight
we can't see the light
we wake up and decide
we dont need to be right
to be happy
i dont think that im complaining
sometimes it keeps on raining
oh but dont be frightened by thunder and lightning
the sun comes out and the flowers grow
and you find you're already on the road
to be happy
yeah to be happy

"don't let your heart let go of love, babe"
don't you let it get away
don't let the dark shade your shine
gotta lose yourself sometimes
and dance out in the rain
when the world has gone insane
learn to make some lemonade
don't you let it slip away
"don't let your heart let go of love, babe"
take your face out of your phone
been inside for too long
open up your eyes
there's a big ole world
waiting outsidе
"don't let your heart let go of lovе, babe"
don't you let it get away
don't let the dark shade your shine
gotta lose yourself sometimes
and dance out in the rain
when the world has gone insane
learn to make some lemonade
don't you let it slip away
"don't let your heart let go of love, babe"
find a rocky mountain high
whatever makes you feel alive
don't be afraid to fall
there's something big
to make you small
"don't let your heart let go of hope, babe"
don't you let it get away
don't let the dark shade your shine
gotta lose yourself sometimes
and dance out in the rain
when the world has gone insane
learn to make some lemonade
don't you let it slip away

he can turn the ties and calm the angry sea
he alone besides who writes a symphony
he lights every star that makes a darkness bright
he keeps watch all through each long and lonely night
he still finds the time to hear a child's first prayer
saint or sinner call and always find him there
though it makes him sad to see the way we live he'll always say i forgive
(he can grab a wish or make a dream come true)
he can paint the clouds and turn the gray to blue)
he alone knows where to find a rainbow's end
he alone can see what lies beyond the bend
he can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold
he knows every lie that you and i have told
though it makes him sad to see the way we live he'll always say i forgive

what do i have to do? where do i have to go?
"to get you off my mind, leave you behind, give me a sign"
what do i have to do to make me stop loving you?
i even met somebody who i thought would be the one to
turn me down a new road far enough to finally lose you
"this losing game i'm playing, smile i'm faking, road i'm taking"
"you'll be waiting, heart's still breaking, just keep on praying"
what do i have to do? where do i have to go?
"to get you off my mind, leave you behind, give me a sign"
what do i have to do to make me stop loving you?
"i want my life back, i wanna move on"

different strokes for different folks
"and so on, and so on and scooby-dooby-doo"

we got to live together
"i am no better, and neither are you"
"we are the same, whatever we do"
"you love me, you hate me, you know me and then"
you can't figure out what bag i'm in
"but i am everyday people, mm"
there is a long hair that doesn't like the short hair
for being such a rich one that will not help the poor one
different strokes for different folks
and so on and so on and scooby-dooby-doo

there is a yellow one that won't accept a black one
that won't accept a red one that won't accept a white one

"well, love can be an uphill climb"
i’m gonna meet a lot of resistance
it takes every ounce of strength we’ve got
if we’re gonna go the distance
we can get discouraged and lose our courage
worrying ‘bout the daily grind
"but life’s a journey, no need to hurry"
it’s one day at a time
one foot in front of the other
take one step and then take another
"keep on walkin’, we’re headed in the right direction"
puttin’ one foot in front of the other
little by little gets a whole lot further
"hittin’ our stride, one foot in front of the other"
what’s down the road we can’t say
and the road behind don’t matter
but every mile along the way
is just another mile together
unconcerned about the twists and turns
we’re takin’ it nice and slow
"safe and sound, covering ground"
steady as she goes
yesterday is dead and gone
and tomorrow takes care of itself
we’ll just keep on keepin’ on
‘cause we ain’t stumbled yet
one foot in front of the other
take one step and then take another
just a-walkin’ and a-talkin’ and a-movin’ in the same direction
puttin’ one foot in front of the other
little by little gets a whole lot further
"hittin’ our stride, one foot in front of the other"
"well, just a-hittin’ our stride"
one foot in front of the other

i hear ones an acrobat
you got 'em swinging from the chandelier
well honey i don't swing like that
the main attraction's leaving

take this diamond back and you'll be two rings shy
of the big top tent
"i ain't gonna get dressed up, just to be your clown"
"ain't gonna paint this pretty face, like you paint the town"

mac arturh park is melting in the dark all the sweet green ising flowing down
someone left the cake out in the rain
but i don't think that i can take it lord it took so long to bake it
i'll never had that recipe again oh no
i recall the yellow cotton dress foaming like a wave on the ground around your knees
and birds like tender babies in your hands
the old man playing checkers by the trees
mac arturh park is melting...

there will be another song for me for and i will sing it
there will be another dream for me someone will bring it
i will taste the wine while it is warm and never let you catch me looking in the sun
but after all the loves of my life after all the loves of my life you'll still be the one
i will take my life into my hands and i will use it
i will win the worship in their eyes and i will lose it
and my passions flow like rivers from the sky
but after all the loves of my life after all the loves of my life
i'll still be along wondering why
mac arturh park is melting...
i am dreamin' tonight of a place i love
even more than i usually do
and although i know it's a long road back
i promise you
i'll be home for christmas
you can count on me
please have snow and mistletoe
and presents under the tree
christmas eve will find me
where the love light gleams
i'll be home for christmas
if only in my dreams
christmas eve will find me
where the love light gleams
i'll be home for christmas
if only in my dreams
if only in my dreams
the old man who sold his apples isn't there anymore
and the city square don't seem as big as it did before
they tore down that old drugstore we used to love so much
but everything it's still the same in my memories of us
that old school bus has long stopped runnin' and i heard the driver died
and the movie house is all boarded up where we sat side by side
and the sign that said state champions is covered up with dust
but everything it's still the same in my memories of us
in my memories of us things are still the same
for yesterdays are something tomorrows cannot change
where freckles just don't disappear and pigtails never rust
and everything it's still the same in my memories of us
my memory of us
oh i believe the time is coming when the lord will come again
i believe the end is closer every day
let's be ready for the judgement when we look upon his face
for he tells us in his word to watch and pray
we are living surely living in the days he speaks about
i believe the end is near in every door
so let's be ready for his coming let us meet him with a shout
and believe today in matthew 24
while upon the mount of olives his disciples came to him
saying tell us when these things are going to be
jesus answered be ye watching let each one be free from sin
and take heed no man shall ever you deceive
we are living surely living...
we are living surely living...
i hear the bluebirds singing i hear the robins too
i hear the church bells ringing oh but i don't hear you
i see little things mark his and hers a constant reminder we're through
i hear the rain on my window oh but i don't hear you
[ piano ]
i hear the children playing i hear the clock striking two
i hear the mailman whistling oh but i don't hear you
i see little things...
i just came by to let you know
"i'll never ever let you go, oh my"
ooo-eee my love
"and if you ever, ever stray"
i know that that will be the day
"that i die, oh my"
ooo-eee my love
"ooo-eee, ooo-eee my baby"
ooo-eee my baby
ooo-eee my love
i've been around the world a bit
"but you're the best thing i've seen yet, oh my"
ooo-eee my love
and if you want to take me on
"we might be at it until dawn, oh my"
ooo-eee my love
"ooo-eee, ooo-eee my baby"
ooo-eee my baby

and if you stay around
"i'm never ever gonna let you down, oh my, oh my"
ooo-eee my love
"ooo-eee, ooo-eee my baby"
ooo-eee my baby
ooo-eee my love
i never saw the sky crimson blue
kaleidoscope my eyes shapes and hues
i learned to bend the light easily
i know there's more beyond what i see
am i inside a dream or wide awake?
"if i can find the key, would i escape?"
caught in between the ledge and letting go
nothing's the way it was anymore
oyah abadohyay
we're returning to the stars that we're made of
we all find our own way
in thе end we'll see we nеver were alone
am i the reason why i'm afraid?
all of the pain inside i can't face
i try to run to you but you're not here
why do the things we love disappear
oyah abadohyay
we're returning to the stars that we're made of
we all find our own way
in the end we'll see we never were alone
never were alone
never were alone
never were alone
it's a true love not a new love that makes my life so much better
tried and proven down through the ages
and it's guaranteed to keep us all together
little children teach us so much remind us of what we've been missing
something precious left behind us gathering dust while we've been drifting
i think you know what i'm speaking of
when you're down on your knees all alone in the night
would you turn away hey from a true love
there's not a man of us alive who can deny true love
[ guitar ]
without the blessing of a true love a life so cold and uncaring
it's the message for a lifetime and the sweetest gift of life is the caring
i think you know...
[ guitar ]
i think you know...
there's not a man of us alive who can deny true love
can anybody here pass me a beer
and i'mma keep playing this music that you hear
and if you know the song
then come and sing along with me
walking with the beach to my left
sea to my right
and i'mma get faded at the tiki bar tonight
then i'mma roll one up
like my name is bob
yeah i'm gonna party like i'm a jamaican
if you really wanna know where you can find me
i'll be unwinding
"down in the islands, down in the islands"
you should loose track of your timing
grab a drink beside me
"down in the islands, down in the islands"
can anybody here pass me the rum
and we can find somebody who can play the steel drums
and if you like this beat then everybody dance with me
we got the ladies to the left
fellas to the right
and everybody's faded at the tiki bar tonight
and we are gonna dance to the rhythm of the waves
while we drink bacardi by the bonfire flames
if you really wanna know where you can find me
i'll be unwinding
"down in the islands, down in the islands"
you should loose track of your timing
grab a drink beside me
"down in the islands, down in the islands"
"you don't need no invitation, no"
whoaaa
if you're looking for relaxation
"get away, get away with me"
make your destination my location
if you really wanna know where you can find me
i'll be unwinding
"down in the islands, down in the islands"
you should loose track of your timing
grab a drink beside me
"down in the islands, down in the islands"
if you really wanna know where you can find me
"i'll be unwinding (down, down, down, down)"
"down in the islands, down in the islands"
you should loose track of your timing
grab a drink beside me
"down in the islands, down in the islands"
i'm making the rounds with someone new now that you've gone away but making the rounds it's not the fun if it was with you the glamour has gone from all the spots that seem so bright and gay but making the rounds is all that's left for me to do.
i never go home till the last hideaway place has closed its door
there's too much at home to remind me that we're through
i laugh and pretend that
i'm not wishing for a bygone day
when we were in love and i was making the rounds with you.

we've been sweethearts for so long
now you say we're thru
the love we shared is just a memory
well i had built a ship of dreams
and planned them all for you
now i guess what is to be will be
so i'll sail my ship alone
with all the dreams i own
drifting out across the ocean blue
i'll sail my ship alone
tho' all the sails are torn
and when it starts to sink then i'll blame you
i gave a message to the wind
to take back home to you
hoping you would hear my s-o-s
hoping that you would come back home
my darling if you knew
just how much my heart was in distress
when it starts to sink then i'll blame you

"well,"
loving you
isn't the right thing to do
how can i ever change things
that i feel
if i could
maybe i'd give you my world
how can i
when you won't take it from me
you can go your own way
go your own way
you an call it
another lonely day
you can go your own way
go your own way
tell me why
everything turned around
packing up
shacking up's all you wanna do
if i could
baby i'd give you my world
open up
everything's waiting for you
you can go your own way
go your own way
you an call it
another lonely day
you can go your own way
go your own way

i'm a'headin' back to dixie
that's the place i long to be
where the cotton grows and the suwanee flows
that's home sweet home to me
where they meet you and they greet you
with the sweetest how you are
"well shut my mouth, i'm a'headin' south"
on the dixie cannonball
"on the dixie cannonball, on the dixie cannonball"
"just listen to the whistle, it'll thrill you one and all"
"and i know there's some one waitin', with the sweetest how you are"
"well shut my mouth, i'm a'headin' south, on the dixie cannonball"
when i cross them smokey mountains. i'll be countin' every mile
"when the whistle blows, i'll be on my toes"
and i'll shuffle down the aisle
and i know i'll not be lonesome
when i see them treetops tall
on the dixie cannonball
"on the dixie cannonball, on the dixie cannonball"
"just listen to the whistle, it'll thrill you one and all"
"and i know there's some one waitin', with the sweetest how you are"
"well shut my mouth, i'm a'headin' south, on the dixie cannonball"
"yes, i'm goin' back to dixie, that's the place i long to be"
