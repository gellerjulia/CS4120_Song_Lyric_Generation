can't you see
that in the world we live in
political lies
are just corporate decisions
they'll take away
"all the hopes, not their promises"
they'll put an end to this
land of the livin
look at the lost souls
they seem so black
look at the lost souls
souls of black
they got control
of the heart of a nation
their social tribes
seem so graciously
as time goes by
'cause time as you came see
will slowly die for you and me
look at the lost souls
they seem so black
look at the lost souls
souls of black
so put an end
to this idolization
antagonizing so commonly
open your eyes
'cause the lie's there so plain to see
life goes on
there's no guarantees
look at the lost souls
they seem so black
look at the lost souls
souls of black
my black face in the shadow
of the pentagram
among the silent forests
in the never existing town
my fingers touched the sky
i was god in forgotten times
jesus and his servants were
sucking my feet
"...lucifer, give me the power to rise"
now i'm fallen
a down of misery
among the blurs of evil
hidden in morality
i had power to destroy god
my demons ruled the crowd
now i can do nothing
alone in black crypt
"...satan, give me the power to rise"
but there will be days
when i shall rise
a dawn of my kingdom
slowly comes
i will fight again
will take your mind
to sit on the golden throne
somewhere in the sky
"...belial, give me the power to rise"
i - i've seen it all before
heading north the parole
i sit here and watch it all come down
a mile away from hell
back in a foreign land
but will tomorrow ever come
"no regrets, no reason why"
"release me, i'm dying"
we stood side by side
everybody's asking why
"we had a dream, it ended in screams"
they sold us as a question of honour
a flash of a shtogun blast lightens the dark
dan dies in a pool of blood
a jet's coming close as gas hits my nose
all the prayers came too late
"no regrets, no reason why"
"release me, i'm dying"
we stood side by side
everybody's asking why
"we had a dream, it ended in screams"
they sold us as a question of honour
the night has fallen but i'm still awake
my chances at zero
"breath for the last time, help's out of reach"
no time for heroes
"no regrets, no reason why"
"release me, i'm dying"
we stood side by side
everybody's asking why
"we had a dream, it ended in screams"
they sold us as a question of honour
hey d.t. what you been up to
it's been a real long time
and your bill's past due
stop right there
don't you look away
'cause you've had your fun
now it's time to pay
well you know that i've been waiting
and i'm really very patient
but you've pushed me way too far
'cause you own me thirty thousand
and with interest it's been growing
while you've hidden in these bars
now i would have said duck it
but then money by the bucket
i hear you're raking in
so please forgive my diction
and prepare for crucifixion
while i write your next of kin
so please don't turn away
you borrowed now you've got to pay
seems your mind's
gone a bit off track
time to readjust
'cause sammy's back
so sammy started dealing
d.t. started reeling
as they tumbled to the floor
the furniture was flying
d.t. had thought of dying
when tex walked through the door
now tex wasn't waiting
and without hesitation
grabbed sammy by the throat
sammy started shakin'
a frightened slab of bacon
hanging like a coat
seemed things were going all right
till sammy pulled a knife
"""if you want to cut the cards"
"sammy's gonna up the odds"""
then everything was quiet
a street after the riot
silence hung like death
and tex he wasn't breathing
his body lay bleeding
a knife inside his chest
when d.t. saw his friend there
he quickly lost his terror
as something tore inside
his face was clenched in hatred
as his mind formulated
how this pimp would die
sammy saw it in his eyes
thought a retreat would be wise
"""seems i've stayed"
a bit too long
so i'll take my things
fear runs wild in the veins of the world
the hate turns the skies jet black
death is assured in future plans
why live if there's nothing there
spectors of doom await the moment
the mallet is sure and precise
cover the crypts of all mankind
with cloven hoove begone
sadistic minds
delay the death
of twisted life
malicious world
the crippled youth try in dismay
to sabotage the carcass earth
all new life must perish below
existence now is futile
"decrepit breath, vile in its stench"
a world in decay
transgressor is as one
sadistic minds
delay the death
of twisted life
malicious world
convulsions take the world in hand
paralysis destroys
nobody's out there to save us
brutal seizure now we die
sadistic minds
delay the death
of twisted life
malicious world
"fire of the light, lil' bloodred ridin' hood angel"
"light before the night, dark you'd try"
you try reversing the ray of fire
the ray amid sets your desire
i'll kill you!
show me the signs of your silence
in the race of corpse alone
"take me down, oh please can i feel you"
my lil' bloodred ridin' hood

little blood i'd blow away
for a second did i go
it's a loss!
but i'll follow you 'til the end of the world
i'll kill it for you
i hate you and i want you dead!
i'll kill you!
show me the signs of your silence
in the race of corpse alone
"take me down, oh please can i feel you?"
my lil' bloodred ridin' hood
pain and death spreaad everywhere
fouul desease hangs in the air
corpses rot live to die
fate selects with closed eyes
black death rules the country and rageess through the land
"victims drop like flies, there seems to be no end"
cities turn to ghost towns awaiting what will come
"people froze with fear, nowhere you could run"
"laughing, crying"
"tumbling, dying"
"fighting, abandoning"
surrendeer to your fate
black death - walks behind
black death - in every smile
black death - at your side
black death - you can't hide
"some are rich, some are poor"
kings and queens beggars fools
as they die they're all the same
fate is cruel but who's to blame
"black death rules the country, there is no good and bad"
"there is no strong or mighty, all must bow their heaad"
everybody is equal as they loosse their breath
"there is no salvation, there is only death"
the reaper's time now and here
a skinless smile spreading feaar
bony hands reaach you
"it is the end, your life is through"
"pray to god for mercy, the reaper laughs aloud"
blood drips from his scythe as he cuts the victims down
"witches call for satan, priests raise their hands"
"strong believes must fall, the reaper rules the land"
"don't give me love, don't give me faith"
"wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead"
"don't give me love, i've had my share"
"beauty nor rest, give me truth instead"
"a crow flew to me, kept its distance"
such a proud creation
"i saw its soul, envied its pride"
but needed nothing it had
"an owl came to me, old and wise"
pierced right through my youth
"i learned its ways, envied its sense"
but needed nothing it had
"don't give me love, don't give me faith"
"wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead"
"don't give me love, i've had my share"
"beauty nor rest, give me truth instead"
"a dove came to me, had no fear"
it rested on my arm
"i touched its paws, envied its love"
but needed nothing it had
"a swan of mine, she came to me"
the lake mirrored her beauty sweet
"i kissed her neck, adored her grace"
but needed nothing she could give
"gar tuht river, ger te rheged"
"gar tuht river, ger te rheged"
"gar tuht river, ger te rheged"
"don't give me love, don't give me faith"
"wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead"
"don't give me love, i've had my share"
"beauty nor rest, give me truth instead"
we ain't gonna take it lyin' down
we're gonna stand on our own two feet
when people knock us down
we're gonna get up off the ground
and start all over again

"driven from their homes, their streets up in flames, forced into the open, into a sea of pain. once found memories of better days gone by, all become lost with every tear they cry."

i wake up in the morning
so far away from home
trying to make it through the day
many miles are between us
i'm sending my love
from this payphone
through the storms we've wandered
many mountains we have climbed
but all the bad times are behind
the road is free - i'm coming home
without you i am like
a ship without its sails
calling the wind to save me
i'd climb the highest mountain
i'd cross the seven seas
just to see you smile again
all the trust that was built along the years
is coming back to stay
"i know, just look ahead"
the road is free - i'm coming home
with every step i'm closer to home
when i'm back you won't be alone
soon i'll see the familiar door before my eyes
and you
through the storms we've wandered
many mountains we have climbed
all the bad times are behind
"the road is, the road is free, and i'm coming home"
listen to her try to suck me dry
problem with you you're afraid to die
they'll come around again and again
but in the end i know i'll win
there's no preference
fuck this lets just kill them dead
fuck with this discussion
fuck this lets just kill them
well well what the fuck
the worst thing has been done to you
that dumb ass will blow you away
no one now is getting dead
you won't feel a thing
or your body's life you were fighting for
got one now is dead
got another that makes two
got one more that is three
don't cross me no more or you're dead
problem with you you're afraid to die
they'll come around again and again
but in the end i know i'll win
fuck this let's just kill them dead
smash their head
kill them all

one of a kind they say they've never seen before

"you've come to see the healer, so don't you be afraid"
"they call me tranquilizer, i'm here to isolate"
we paint in black and white and you're the dirty in between
"monstrosity of nature, a virulent disease"
"can't you see, can't you see"
that you are not like anyone?
you'll never see through anyone else's eyes
and who am i to certify the sanity of a twisted mind

i heard the voice of redemption
for me there is no exemption
i started praying
i heard the voice of satisfaction
needing me for benefaction
i started pleading
i heard the bells begin to chime
warning me oh lord
don't let this be my time
don't let this be my time
"i'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire"
"i'll be there for you, when the flames get higher"
when nothing fits and nothing seems right
"till the very last breath of my life, i'll be there for you"
"you saw me slide, you saw me fall"
we kept our pride through it all
we started screaming
"when skies are dark, no sun shines through"
i know i see the light in you
we stopped dreaming and started believing
"i'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire"
"i'll be there for you, when the flames get higher"
when nothing fits and nothing seems right
"till the very last breath of my life, i'll be there for you"
i'll be there
in my hour of need
you were there always
now it's time for me to be there for you too
always
i'll be there for you
you can take away the money
you can take away the gold
you can tell me it's the truth
you know it isn't so
you can say that i'm a vandal
when i ain't done nothing wrong
you can say you've had a good time
when you've really thought it bad
just let me rock
you can take away the profit
you can give away my share
you can tell me it's a diamond
when it's just a piece of glass
you can tell me i've got nothing
when i hold it in my hand
you can say a scrap of paper
was a contract that i signed
just let me rock
you can take away my heroes
you can take away the pride
you can tell me i can trust you
then you take me for a ride
you can say i'm drinking water
when i'm really drinking wine
you can say i'm really clever
then you laugh behind my back
forces of the northern light - assemble!
forces of the northern night - call to arms!
summoned by the secrets of sacrifice

meeting destiny on the road we took to avoid it
as we only compete with ourselves
left is that of a confident union
dimmu borgir!
deceit is everywhere you turn
we weed out the weak and their weep
dimmu borgir!
evolving compulsively
behaving inconsistently
yet the pulse is pounding
restoration is the name
for those who are left in the game

the deviants seek but one place
dimmu borgir!

forgive we shall not
forget we shall not
with trickery and treats
enemies will face defeat
no place for dreamers
as our formation is lava
fire is with or against you
"and so it burns, so it burns"
constant retribution calling
from the shadows of three consecutive sixes
merging with the cold dark vacuum
talent is worthless unless excercised
when the world is turning
you'll find your true nature
when the first is last and the last is first
you'll be where you choose to be
you'll be where you choose to be
forgive we shall not
forget we shall not
fire is with or against you
and so it burns
reach inside of me
far beneath the encasing of ashes
bleeding red
still showing signs of life
remove the darkness
take me away
a stream of hope destroy this corrupted cell
purification
(leaving me desolate in the face of perfection)
unable to hide i am drawn to the fire
it is this pain that brings me likely do
drawing attention to yourself
at anothers expense.
your puritan stance
carries a certain pretence.
"when an ego is at stake,"
there's always a point to make.
bigotted and self opinionated
there is no give and take.
"obsessed with changing the world,"
"alone i walk, hearing a voice"
that's calling my name
no one should be here
take no one with you
"god, why i didn't care"
on through death take me away
to the place time will not fade
colder than dead
darkness - eternity
but look out
a hundred thousand centuries
the sun had never seen
so near but so much too far
eternal place you know what's life
but cannot tell
i can never see you changing
but you look to me
time will never heal your wounds
but you're immortal
ref.:
hall of the king a vision of the end
hall of the king don't cry for us
don't hear us calling
oh watch out for me hall of the light
my last sign
you find yourself
just take a look
to see you must open your eyes
like a hawk in the sky
a wonder that dies
don't ask me wy

you're the birth and you're the end
you've been hurt but you're not dead
discovering you is what should never be

destructive are our minds
it's much too late
(solo: kai/harmony lead: kai)
ref.
a nocturnal concerto
candlelight whispers me where to go
hymn of gathering stars as my guide
as i wander on this path of the night
embroidery of the stars
undress my feelings for this earth
send me your salva to heal my scars
and let this nakedness me my birth
macrocosm poured its powers on me
and the hopes of this world i now must leave
the nightwish i sent you centuries ago
has been heard by those
who dwelled in a woe
the distance of our bridal bed
await for me to be dead
dust of the galaxies take my hand
lead me to my beloved's land
departed by the guillotine of death
i received a letter from the depth
the dream of my lover it carried inside
caressed by the sharpest knife
i asked you to be my wife
rays of the setting sun
were my tears wept upon promises undone
come to me
make me believe
to you and your love again
beneath the great eye
i shall desire you forevermore

we were on the russian border
when the news began to break
of a nuclear reactor melting down
sending deadly clouds of dust
into the atmosphere
falling down like rain on the ground
we were laying in the sun
listening to the radio
when someone said you'd better get inside
we didn't know how serious the situation was
that many people to the north had died
"red alert, red alert (*)"
screaming in my head
there's something i'm not sure of going down
"red alert, red alert"
screaming in the night
that fallout seems to follow me around
we made our way to hungary
thinking we were safe there from the storm
but the deadly cloud was high above taken by the wind
spreading like a plague across the land
a threat you couldn't see
nothing you could feel
but something evil floating in the air
look towards the east
the danger yet to come
for the earth
we made a silent prayer
have you heard that pakis stink
"jews are cheap, bad drivers are chink"
have you heard that spics will steal
"japs are sneaks, a gypsy's deal"
racial hostility
i get disgusted by all of this biggotted crap
i get revolted time after time
"racial hostility, a henious crime"
"love to hate, hate to love"
racial hostility
"love to hate, hate to love"
have you heard that injuns drink
niggers are bad and breed like mink
have you heard that wops lay brick
"greeks pump ass, an irish mick"
racial hostilty
"repugnant and ignorant, bad to the core"
i just don't want to hear no more
i get disgusted by things people say
take your hatred and go away
i'm getting sick of the news
neo nazis still hate jews
how many blacks are in jail
how can we help but fail
don't tell me we can't make it right
why should we have to fear the night
nothing like a tyrant's gratitude
his highness knows the words unspoken
his highness knows crash you cry
he feels you in his bones
nothing like a tyrant's gratitude
his silence may seem pretty chilling
his violence may seem awfully cold
"but oh, you're such a foe"
nothing like a tyrant's gratitude
nothing like a tyrant's gratitude
he wants to make a show of you
"when you belch your little truth,"

his majesty may send his minion
his majesty's now being rude
and oh what other beast would let his eagle feed on you?
nothing like a tyrant's gratitude
his holiness would ignore your secret
he feels you from his throne you fool
and wants to fill his bones with you
nothing like a tyrant's gratitude
nothing like a tyrant's gratitude
nothing like a tyrant's gratitude
nothing like a tyrant's gratitude

dream have swept me away
into a long forgotten realms
down into the depths of the earth
into a hidden cavern
into the world below
i walk into the forgotten past
do not turn around
never look back
fathers and mothers from ancient times
ghosts from a forgotten world
with wonder they look upon me
what took you so long
i wander not in darkness
"i am not lost, nor bewildered"
the path is not hidden
the tracks are not old
i was here a moment ago
i am home
i am home
ordinary days
"breathing life, as true as honest work"
"breathing life, a truth for all its worth"
you want to seem to be as fragile as can be
i want to roll inside that shell you call a mind
"breathing life, as frail as insincere"
"breathing life, too cold to shed a tear"
you want to seem to be as fragile as can be
i want to see the things that i'm supposed to see
i want to know the fear that sits inside of me
"i want to breathe the air, like i was meant to on ordinary days"
you want to seem to be as fragile as can be
i want to see the things that i'm supposed to see
i want to know the fear that sits inside of me
in a time which now is forgotten
was a land of horror and death
it was known as a place without mercy
evil ruled... evil ruled that land
in this land behind of nowhere
lived this man who killed for glory
it was no place for weakness
evil ruled that land
"king of evil, his word was law"
tortured and slaughtered they wanted his head
it was no place for justice
evil ruled that land
tyrant from hell
thy name is written with their blood
king of the past
so cruel and mean you better die
tyrant from hell
they gonna get you in the end
king of the past
you know you're gonna die at last
then came the day he lost his head
slaughtered in hate and blood
it was no place of mercy
evil ruled that land
ruins
that stand
fear
what you don't understand
within these walls
seek your truth
denounce the lies
beneath this roof
have i lost myself
have i lost my soul
as i drift so far
so far from home
i close my eyes
now i can see
am i losing myself?
or am i free?
lost shame
without care
in your search for truth
and what's really there
disregard of the past
disregard the shadow it casts
"nettie, no need to cry"
let me wipe those tear drops from your eyes
in the dark bathed in cathode ray blue
miss red hook of 1922
weeping silently for the pain of others
every night a tearful rosary
a victim of the curse of empathy
her reward for compassion is to suffer
"nettie, no need to cry"
let me wipe those tear drops from your eyes
my shortcomings i know caused her grief
still she loves me. this i can't believe!
responding not with anger but a prayer
heaven's just southwest of cobble hill
"true, i am the son of an angel"
"maternally, not one woman compares"
"nettie, no need to cry"
let me wipe those tear drops from your eyes
"if you fall, i will catch you"
"when you're lost, i'll be there soon"
"far away, but of course near"
"when you're sad, i'm always here"
thank you for saving me from myself
your compassion became its own hell
unequivocably beautiful inside and out
without a doubt
"nettie, no need to cry"
let me wipe those tear drops from your eyes
the silent peace this anguished morning brings leaves me to my grief
"oh, so many years i've been married to the grave"
these bitter tears fill up my sorrowed eyes as i lay my head down
and beg myself to be so brave'
"oh, how i miss your loving hate' and yet i miss her loving hate"
cursed be this love i bear
bereaved be this heart that bleeds for her
the love of the man lives here'
"-on grain and the earth, rain and the chilling air"
the burning passion the glowing sunset gives will leave me to my joy
and i'll laugh upon the stroke that murders me
"so farewell my love, take all of myself and kill this love forsaken"
and please send me no need of thee'
"oh, how i miss your loving hate' and yet i miss her loving hate"
cursed be this love i bear
bereaved be this heart that bleeds for her
the love of the man lives here'
"-on grain and the earth, rain and the chilling air"
"festering scabs, papillae and pores"
"hardened carbuncles, spots and cold sores..."
pick at the scab - septic blood starts to weep
rip at my face - ruptured growths start to seep
"blackhead and boils, pustular cysts"
"chapped commodones, perspiring zits..."
pierce the blane - infected tissue starts to bleed
diseased and plagued - tumours chew and feed...
...on ulcerated flesh...
...on facial mess...
...on blooming sores...
...on blistering warts...
"squeeze out the blood, the pus i extract"
"a rancid cocktail, steaming and black"
"infested skin, bubbles and bursts"
"hackne vulgaris, spluttering pus..."
...the swarming mass...
...with acid i attack...
...with razors i hack...
"...bubos, bulging and black..."
"squeeze out the blood, the pus i extract"
"a rancid cocktail, steaming and black"
"bursting canker, clustered bullae"
pimples and bones eat me alive...
"gnawing, curdling, swarming flesh"
"bubbling, seething, disgusting mess"
"smarting, abrased purple and raw"
"pustular, vulgar pimples and sores..."
the juice is squeezed
sebum bleeds
lick the pox
weals and warts...
festering face
too many things happened today
too many words i don't wanna say
i wanna be cool but the heat's coming up
i'm ready to kill 'cause enough is enough
all i can say - out of my way
before i get to the top
all i can feel is wild running blood
please stop - you better watch it
it's getting up to the limit
up to the limit
it's getting up to the limit

do me a favour and leave me alone
the most i love you is when you're gone
"please, disappear and don't come back"
i'm not the kind of guy you can check
all i can say - out of my way
before i get to the top
all i can feel is wild running blood
please stop - you better watch it
it's getting up to the limit

cast down between two worlds
across the dark son of awareness
the body hologram born
from the dust of a dying star
neverending now of infinite illusions
free to tremble in fear and pain
limited by misfortune
flawed by design
lost in a lost world
gods in exile
feed on the weak
and the wounded
quarantined in the
labyrinth of time
set free from gravity's weight
alchemical wedding
of crystalline heavy light
oh heavenly father please forgive us
for we know not what we do
look at your life
look at the way you slip and slide
look at your time
look at the ones you've left behind
look at your eyes
the haunted black circles of your plight
but you can get bye
oh and killing you might take one more night
'cuz you're a famous monster
you do what ever they offer
you tie their noose around your neck
and they throw you over
'cuz your a famous monster
look at your mind
look at the strength you never found
you lean on your pride
the only friend that would never let you down
look at the signs
look at the way they stop and stare
they're watching you die
and when you're gone it's like you were'nt even there
'cuz you're a famous monster
you do what ever they offer
you tie their noose around your neck
and they throw you over
'cuz your a famous monster
you do whatever they offer
you tie their noose around your neck
and they throw you over

i have seen through the mirror of the lake
i touch the soil from my mother earth
i burn the plants to the grand fire
the holy winds - my father air
into the mirror of water
i am travelling looking for my destiny
"the incense burns, i fly insane"
i'm looking for the visions of the land of the free
"oh! great mother dana, please guide me"
"bless my long way, look after me"
i'll thank you eternally!
the moon arises in the sky
tells me that i must stop now
"my body is weak, i drink the wine"
i can't remember what i saw
"oh! great mother dana, please guide me"
"bless my long way, look after me"
i'll thank you eternally! immrama!
dream and spread your dreams to someone else
you get the wings to fly
higher and higher then you dive deep inside of you
freeze all your black thoughts and blow them up
in thousand of pieces and
"get in the rain, let the body get blessed"
"slip through the wind, running so fast"
"you are the miracle, wish all you can wish in your life"
"until the last chances, chances for your victories!"
gotta go! gotta go! gotta get to the top
"get a wish, get a wish, get a wish to you"
always you have freedom keep on moving!
gotta go! gotta go! gotta get to the wish!
"get a will, get a will, get a will to you"
always your own dreams will keep on moving!
see! your hope is rising from the flood
in a thousand forms of dreams
"get in the rain, let the body get blessed"
"slip through the wind, running so fast"
"you are the miracle, wish all you can wish in your life"
"until the last chances, chances for your victories!"
gotta go! gotta go! gotta get to the top
"get a wish, get a wish, get a wish to you"
always you have freedom keep on moving!
gotta go! gotta go! gotta get to the wish!
"get a will, get a will, get a will to you"
always your own dreams will keep on moving!
i get in from work at 2a.m.
and sit down with a beer
turn on the late night t.v.
and then wonder why i'm here
it's meaningless and trivial
and it washes over me
and once again i wonder
is this all there is for me
here i am again
look at me again
here i am again
on my own
trying hard to see
what there is for me
here i am again
on my own
life seems so pathetic
i wish i could live it all behind
"this canvas chair, this bed,"
these walls that fall in on my mind
hold on for something better
that just drags you trough the dirt
do you just let go or carry on
and try to take the hurt
"i've been walking through your streets,"
"where all your money's earning,"
where all your building's crying

"4000 hungry children leave us per hour,"
"from starvation,"

creating death showers.
"boom, boom, boom, boom,"

why must we kill our own kind...

"into the valley of death, rode six hundred valiant men, through infernos flames and billowing smoke, never to be seen again. sabers drawn at the bugles call, charge for your land and your sires, agony calls, bodies fall, in the rain of cannon fire."
charge... there's no turning back in the valley of death. charge... amidst the smoke and the stench of the dragons breath. charge... past the shells and the viliant that fall. charge... into the cannons and slay them... all!!!
"crater holes, graves to be, scar the battlefield, the ride is long the charge is hard, no one shall ever yield. the barricades, the destination, let the carnage begin, many lie fallen that answered the calling, vowing to never give in."

let's take a walk down memory lane
when i was just a boy and i wasn't insane
back before the world got inside of my heart
before all the sickness almost tore me apart
"corruption, deception"
a natural progression
denial was a drug that i couldn't refuse
now i'm just a puppet
always singin' for my supper
blame it on myself
but i know it was you
i know it was you
here we go again
life turns another corner
no way around it
i was born to fall behind
here i go again
life makes another loner
no way around it
you will never be my kind
you're not my kind
"my dad was a killer, a cold blooded guerilla"
something i can never perceive
"mom was just a survivor, worked till it broke her"
she always landed right on her feet
"rejection, infection"
down the wrong direction
could never walk a day in their shoes
from a child to a leper
feels like i've been severed
blame it on the world
cause i know that it's true
i know it's true
here we go again
life turns another corner
no way around it
i was born to fall behind
here i go again
life makes another loner
no way around it
you will never be my kind
you're not my kind
hahaha
you're not my kind
you're not my kind
you're not my kind
you're not my kind
here we go again
life turns another corner
no way around it
i was born to fall behind
here i go again
life makes another loner
no way around it
you will never be my kind
you're not my kind
you're not my kind

"through the thunders, wind and rain"
people? re sayin? there? ll be peace on earth
all their prayes were not in vain
have you ever been blinded by the pain?
"blinded, blinded by the painunwilling to see, senseless"
so blinded by selfishness
only focusing on myself
and ignoring anyone else
becoming driven by despair
feeling trapped into a corner
losing more and more of reality
perceiving all the hurt only one-sidedly
have you ever been blinded by the pain?
losing yourself inside the heartache
losing yourself
feeling too powerless to change
stuck and unable to escape
incapable to see another way
"i need someone to shake me, to wake me"
i don't even need full clarity
just to start the shift from blind to blurry
have you ever been blinded by the pain?
losing yourself inside the heartache
and does that mean we cannot change?
or will we always be seen that way?
will we always be seen that way?
and does that really mean we have not changed?
or does it only mean
the truth is not in how we're seen?
but in the actions that we're now determined to take
revealing the new path we chose to mend the heartache
was it a pattern or a disastrous mistake?
is the truth in what you see or what i say?
have you ever been blinded by the pain?
losing yourself inside the heartache
and does that mean we cannot change?
or will we always be seen that way?
be seen that way?
blinded by pain? (blinded by the pain)
and does that really mean we have not changed?
can you feel their haunting presence?
can you feel their haunting presence?

"freedom, freedom, free, free"
they run the endless debate
who's right and who is wrong
in their eyes we've all failed in life
old men in silk and diamonds
decide who's right to kill
a soldier with god; not so his wife
it's just another way to multiply their power
they need a reason to survive
seven deadly sins
"just give them fear of hell, obey the ivory tower"
if they all want to stay alive
seven deadly sins - seven deadly sins
who are they to speak justice
about another man
they've tortured and killed through history
how can you dogmatise it
you cannot shape the truth
there's no way to order belief
it's just another game to multiply their power
they need a reason to survive
seven deadly sins
"if we all fear their hell, obey their ivory tower"
they have a chance to stay alive

tonight i'm taking her instead
my hands are so much stronger
than her isty-bitsy little head
empty eyes are staring at the wall
i cannot hear her breathing anymore
i'm looking for the key in her hand
that bluish little hand
running through the empty halls of this forgotten place
unlocking doors... that never open
but now i've got the key... the key to freedom
and i'm unlocking doors that never should be opened
"waiting in the dark, i cannot take another night"
"waiting in the dark, i cannot take it anymore"
"6, 6, 6 miles... i've been running through the woods"

one other year has left my life
one year bygone so soon
these were the days i sacrificed
these days were lived for you
some came with winter in white
some days were blown away
some came with sultry summer nights
some with october rain
"oh, how i long for utter silence"
but who am i to know
when rain will turn to snow?
if life brings another day
are you standing on your own
when the darkness closes in
can you hear the voices calling from within
do you see the spirit world
like a cold and frightened child
or is you imagination running wild
is there anybody out there
we're waiting for a sign
calling to the afterlife
is anybody there
beyond the grave
on a breath of cold night air
the candle starts to dim
when shadows dance the walls start closing in
does your fear begin to rise
are you paralysed with fright
can they hear you screaming in the night
it's difficult for me to get a grip on what you mean
when you stick your fingers in your ear and create another scene
you always step into the traps set perfect in your path
busy going crazy over whose knife's in your back
dive inside your blackest stare
the one that's saving do you date
screaming that you're scared
you the tallest soul
with the shortest self-esteem
painted as the victim
who's split between the beams
it doesn't seem to matter
it's nothing
dead a dream is dying
it's nothing
best friend i never had
play me to the point of pushing me too far away
"i can only say whatever, ambivalent to your game"
"you can pretend to the mirror, it's the lie you tell yourself"
and i won't walk on eggshells that's a dance for someone else
dive inside your blackest stare
the one that's saying do you dare
screaming that you're scared
you the tallest soul
with the shortest self-esteem
painted as the victim
who's split between the beams
it doesn't seem to matter
it's nothing
dead a dream is dying
it's nothing
best friend i never had

"life is a misery, don't know how it's come to be"
"death, the epitome of all of our days"
in the past we had no choice to hear or to be the voice
close your eyes and visualise the demon to arise
you know that sanity is not as it was meant to be
and now that misery has taken a new stand
in the land of a thousand souls we will carry on through the rain
in the sun we will move along with the memories of the slain
when i see this humanity and the evil that they have come to be
we've come to the point of no return and you beg for just...
one more time to escape from all this madness
one more time to be set free from all this sadness
and one last time to be the one who understand
"my soul and my spirit will go on, for all of eternity"
"foreign the currency, your payment in blood to be"
death is the destiny for all of our ways
in the dark you hide away for who or what you can't say
when i see the power of the devil come alive
you know that sanity is not as it was meant to be
and now that misery has taken a new stand
on the wings of eagles flying staring on to the sun
reaching for the gold horizon when the war shall be won
can you see the debautury and the blade of death that has come for thee
in winds of torment forever more you will cry for just...
one more time to escape from all this madness
one more time to be set free from all this sadness
and one last time to be the one who understand
"my soul and my spirit will go on, for all of eternity"
in the land of a thousand souls we will carry on through the rain
in the sun we will move along with the memories of the slain
when i see this humanity and the evil that they have come to be
we've come to the point of no return and you beg for just...
one more time to escape from all this madness
one more time to be set free from all this sadness
and one last time to be the one who understand
my soul and my spirit will go on
"my soul and my spirit will go on, for all of eternity"
they came for him one winter's night.
"arrested, he was bound."
"they said there'd been a robbery,"
his pistol had been found.
"they marched him to the station house,"
he waited for the dawn.
"and as they led him to the dock,"
he knew that he'd been wronged.
"""you stand accused of robbery,"""
he heard the bailiff say.
"he knew without an alibi,"
tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.
"over the hills and far away,"
for ten long years he'll count the days.
"over the mountains and the seas,"
a prisoner's life for him there'll be.
"he knew that it would cost him dear,"
but yet he dare not say.
"where he had been that fateful night,"
a secret it must stay.
he had to fight back tears of rage.
his heart beat like a drum.
"for with the wife of his best friend,"
he spent his final night of freedom.
"over the hills and far away,"

over the hills and far away.
"over the hills and,"
"over the hills and,"

"each night within his prison cell,"
he looks out through the bars.
he reads the letters that she wrote.
one day he'll know the taste of freedom.
"over the hills and far away,"
she prays he will return one day.
"as sure as the rivers reach the seas,"
back in his arms he swears she'll be.
"over the hills and far away,"
he swears he will return one day.
far from the mountains and the seas
back in her arms is where he'll be.

loads of times i'm the losing man
it's the same old situation
just another constellation
daggers drawn with a steady hand
you push the aggravation
to your final destination
cut me out in copper
use me as a doped
down on your feet now
how does it feel now?
as you get yourself some
self-esteem and now some heat in your room
in your eyes
in your mind
i'm two out of seven
we're in your eyes
we're in your life
just two out of seven
as you watch my world from the outside
you think that you are strong
that you dream that you belong
you're supreme cause you know how to spell right
"you drown in salivation, you set off from frustration"
living on a copper
use me as a doped
i know that lately
afraid since's been stately
as you gag yourself some
self-esteem and now some heat in your room
in your eyes
in your mind
i'm two out of seven
we're in your eyes
we're in your life
maybe two out of seven
we're in your eyes
we're in your mind
i'm three out of ten
out of nine
i'm just fine
i'm only whatever
we're in your eyes
we're in your mind
i'm two out of seven
we're in your eyes
we're in your life
i'm two out of seven

cerulean sky over desert fields and sand veils
and underneath a lioness is stalking narrowing rings
"feel her coming near, she smells the blood, her prey is near"
"so see her, hear her, feel her, be her"
the lioness is hunting us
so beautiful and dangerous
her embrace is murderous
beware of the lioness
do you feel her gentle touch
her sweet caress hurts just as much
"so take care, take care of her"
the lioness will win
so close you hear her purring
so close she smells your fear
not close enough to lose yourself
beware - the lioness is near
one has to come to terms with one's own mortality.
and you can't really help people
"who are having problems with mortality,"
if you've got problems of your own.
"so you have to begin to sort things out,"
and i thought i had sorted things out
"until i saw this excerpt from this book,"
of certainty i shall remember what it said:
"""life is not the opposite of death."
"death is the opposite of birth. life is eternal."""
and i thought that it's the most profound words
i have ever heard about that issue and it really put me in peace.
i felt it was a wonderful story.
and that's it. what else is there to say?
"life is eternal. surely the opposite of life is not death,"
but life is eternal. there is no opposite.
"and so, what happens is,"
"i suppose, and isn't this a raging state of pure consciousness,"
stillness and silence?
"yeah, what we are looking for now,"
"we are searching for and we have been searching for,"
"now we've become closer to it and now we know it's already there,"
"is there for ever to seek, it's there, and it's going be there,"
"all the time, forevermore."
only you can heal your life
only you can heal inside
life is eternal

it has been foretold
by the visions of the old
and the madness in their eyes
said his angel will arise
"that's what they know : ""holy lord it's over, oh god"
we have done no wrong
so we go where we belong
to the neverending dream
"but for those who lived in sin"""
"they claim to know : ""holy lord it's over, oh god"""
[pope:]
"hey angel, can you tell me"
will you lead us to the place
"full of heat, in the fire"
for we only brought disgrace
[lugaid:]
he is not the one. if they only knew
[bishop:]
"hey angel, will you take us"
to the judgement of his rage
hey will we die
for we couldn't close the gate
[lugaid:]
to the knowledge as they have been told
[gabriel:]
i don't know how could i prove
nothing but the cloven hoof
reigning over them as well
while they keep on fighting hell
babylon the scarlet whore has come
"we are the seven, judgement of heaven"
why don't we know : we are the angels
"it's revelation, soul castignation"
fire will burn us away

why don't we know : we are the angels

hope it only has been ment
for the sin of the dreamer
who broke the low you'd sent

"hey, don't know but i wondered:"
when we lost the seal again
maybe stoned by the incense
do we rise or just descent

once i have been lost in what they told me to believe
until i felt in burning deep inside to set my spirit free
and i escaped to another world to help the little men
who make me plunge into philosophy - to feel my
mind again... no one left to hold me tight - on the
'real'other side - but her in chains
i had been alone till the madman come along
with the knowledge and silver long beard
he was the first man ever teaching how i could be free
helping me to find - oh - the mind and the soul
they've been trying to hide away...
and he promised we'd help anna if i'd help him to
go all the way
[lugaid:]
go all the way into the world of minds
open the gate and do not close behind
prevent them from hiding the light away
prevent them from tellin' us tales
or the end of all they scare us with will be a
million empty brains...
[gabriel:]
i could bring you what you told me
the seal they need to close the gate forever
but still i haven't found a meaning
anna will we ever be together
[regrin:]
you've been fighting for your soul
and sometimes it takes a toll
hope one day you'll understand
what it means to hold in hands
what they call a fantasy
it is nothing but a key
to the world that now you're in
that they call a wicked dream
[elderane:]
when you're walking on your own
when you're broken and alone
you may feel us from inside -
on the other side of life.
ohohohoh...
[gabriel:]

"fire and water, wind and rain"
wings that carry hell in every vein
"world possessions, endless taers"
truth and knowledge stolen all their years
"world turns slowly, sun don't shine"
silence stills the air and kills the chime
"words are poison, passion bleeds"
2000 years on earth has sown the seeds
the time of dreams has turned
the night is gone and light shines on
where darkness once would hide
"with spirits high, our fears were born"
"receiver of light, the kingdom of god will guide you"
keep you from a restless heart
"deceiver of night, the stranger that laughs"
"within you, the reason for the restless heart"
is the keeper of the sabbath stones
"fire and water, wind and rain"
wings that carry hell in every vein
"world turns slowly, sun don't shine"
silence stills the air and kills the chime
can faith destroy desire? each breath a prayer
each step brings fear
the eyes of they that see have evil stare
watch over me
"receiver of light, the kingdom of god will guide you"
keep you from a restless heart
"deceiver of night, the stranger that laughs"
"within you, the reason for the restless heart"
is the keeper of the sabbath stones
and he's the keeper of the sabbath stones
what god is this that stands to hear his people cry?
what hand would strike and watch his people die?
"what life that takes, what future did we earn?"
"it's our mistakes, take heed the sabbath stones"
what life that takes what future did we earn?
it's our mistakes
"my time has come, the clouds are calling"
december wind has come my way
and now i feel the will falling
all at once it's too late
life fades away
the night is my wake
all thoughts slip away
and even though i must leave you
remember i love you
i'll always be in your memory
and i will always be with you when i'm gone
"fade, life fades away"
"oh yea, yea, yea, yea"
life fades away
i'm tired of tomorrow
lost for today
i long to be
at peace forever
my eternity
and even though i will miss you
i must leave you
"fade, life fades away"
"oh yea, yea, yea, yea"
life fades away
so please forgive me
and try not to cry
i long to be at peace forever more
forever more
"oh yea, yea, yea, yea"
"yea, yea, yea, yea, yea"
"yea, yea, yea, yea, yea"
life fades away
life fades away
life fades away
away
one last thing to say
life fades away
you're runnin' around in the gamblin' hall
every night it's the same
you're lookin' for something new to play
to win and have fun is your aim
a pinball speaks to you
his metal voice is knockin' in your head
you can't resist you'll have to play
you're just another victim caught in the trap
"gorgar will eat you, gorgar - man you'll never win - hey"
"gorgar will eat you, gorgar - but you keep on playin' - hey"
your blood is boilin' your eyes grow wide -
advance - too late
gamblin' fever has taken your mind - this fuckin' machine of hate
you spend all your money but you'll never win
you're always the loser and the robot's voice keeps hammering
"gorgar will eat you, gorgar - man you'll never win - hey"
"gorgar will eat you, gorgar - but you keep on playin' - hey"
wastin' money for fun every night
livin' for today no thoughts for tomorrow
man you are dead don't you realize
wake up and live before it's too late
solo: mike / kai
"gorgar will eat you, gorgar - man you'll never win - hey"
"gorgar will eat you, gorgar - but you keep on playin' - hey"
tilt
"hey, girl, stop what you're doing'!"
"hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin."
i don't know what it is that i like about you
but i like it a lot
won't let me hold you
let me feel your loving' charms
communication breakdown
it's always the same
i’m having a nervous breakdown
drive me insane!
"hey, girl, i got something i think you ought to know."
"hey, babe, i wanna tell you that i love you so."
"i wanna hold you in my arms, yeah!"
i’m never gonna let you go
'cause i like your charms
i want you to love me all night...
i want you to love me all night
i want you to love me
i want you to love...yeah!
i want you to love!
"yeah, if love was money"
i would always pay the price
while a million dollars
will never ever change my life
it's an endless highway
the whisky bars and one-night stands
lost in a cheap hotel
you know a woman needs a man
"can't you see it's all for you, yeah"
don't go stealing my soul away
i'm giving it to you
don't go stealing my soul away
"i'm living just for you, for you"
alright
so every song i sing
comes from a lonely heart on stage
but they're still together
more than a thousand miles away
can't you feel my love for you
don't go stealing my soul away
i'm giving it to you
don't go stealing my soul away
"i'm living just for you, for you"
don't go stealing my soul away
i'm giving it to you
don't go stealing my soul away
i'm living just for you
don't go stealing my soul away
i'm giving it to you
don't go stealing my soul away
i'm living just for you
take me down
to a ground
just let me feel it
if i let someone down
please welcome
him on the loosing side
i shake you off
and make my choice
don't wanna hear you
your slimy voice
"please go down, please"
i don't wanna feel you
around me
take me down to a
higher ground
to survive your
mindless sound
if you know all the people
why are you alone?
if you know all the people
you'll be goin' down
i feel that man
on my back
don't promise any crap
someone will break
your neck
you don't know how
to soak my soul
let me out
let me go
open your eyes
you told nothing but lies
"please go down, please"
"c'mon, go down with"
your ego
take me down to a
higher ground
to survive your
mindless sound
if you know all the people
why are you alone?
if you know all the people
you'll be goin' down
"let me go ahead,"
let me go
i will find
an explanation
where's my only
deatination
separated ways
now and forever
is the one and only
measure
tales full of
exaggerations
no more manipulations
and i think you are
not funny
your brain is just a
bloated dummy
take me down to a
higher ground
to survive your
mindless sound
if you know all the people
why are you alone?
if you know all the people
you'll be goin' down
once i was - now i am no more
a burst of flames threw me into oblivion
the life i knew - seems distant and unreal
"a fading dream, a memory i can't recall"
am i real - i can no longer tell
a notion tells me i still exist
infinite dark - through this void i float
"resting, waiting for the day"
when i will live again
eons pass or maybe i just blinked
deeper into this hell i sink
falling through ginnungagap
i'm pulled towards an unseen gate
i seem to hear my name being called
i float towards these cries of fate
faster than - the speed of light
stars flash by - before my eyes
the time has come to return
out of the dark - into the light
back into life i am cast
by my side to reclaim that once we lost
"eons have passed, i'm back from the dead"
victory lies ahead
i have brought this treasure
of berries red and apples fallen
"from the soil, from these grounds"
would you take them as your own
come before the winter's gale
before the frost and snow
take what i will give you
accept my sacrifice
covered sun has gone away
when the world has gone
take what i will give you
accept my sacrifice
i have brought this treasure
and lay my gift on bed of sprigs
you will find when darkness falls
my offerings of clean cold stones
come before the winter's gale
before the frost and snow
take what i will give you
accept my sacrifice
covered sun has gone away
when the world has gone
take what i will give you
accept my sacrifice
come before the winter's gale
before the frost and snow
take what i will give you
accept my sacrifice
covered sun has gone away
when the world has gone
take what i will give you
accept my sacrifice
i cannot tell you you're falling apart
open your eyes if you wanna survive
i want to tell you your love is a lie
"but i won't tell you, i won't tell you"
"i can't leave this, i am fine inside it"
i don't feel bliss and i just keep hiding
i've been burnt so bad but i still play with fire
sometimes naked truth is what i don't believe in
i cannot tell you you're falling apart
open your eyes if you wanna survive
i want to tell you your love is a lie
"but i won't tell you, i won't tell you"
i cannot get so deep into this now
i can't admit that i know what i know
and i want to tell you your love is a lie
"i won't tell you, i won't tell you"
it's hard to hear through the static again
it's never clear until the rush of pain
i'll never tell you i'm living a lie
in this confusion i feel alive
i've been burnt so bad but i still play with fire
sometimes naked truth is what i can't believe in
i cannot tell you you're falling apart
open your eyes if you wanna survive
i want to tell you your love is a lie
"but i won't tell you, i won't tell you"
i cannot get so deep into this now
i can't admit that i kinow what i know
and i want to tell you your love is a lie
"i won't tell you, i won't tell you"
don't ever tell me i'm falling apart
don't ever tell me i will not survive
don't ever tell me this love is a lie
"'cause i am the lie, i am the liar"
i cannot tell you you're falling apart
open your eyes if you wanna survive
i want to tell you your love is a lie
"but i won't tell you, i won't tell you"
i cannot get so deep into this now
i can't admit that i kinow what i know
and i want to tell you your love is a lie
"i won't tell you, i won't tell you"
i won't tell you
i feel like drowning in this world of misery.
i raise my fist to fight this stupidity.
my inner self tells me to keep on struggling.
for those absolute rights and against their suffering.
and i don’t regret my self- reliance.
in this world full of dead and senseless dying.
"too much blood has been shed, greed leads to violence."
in this world full of death i keep on trying…
blood covers your conscience…profit stops your pity!
can’t you see their suffering?
how can you ignore their pain?
"look at the locked- up victims, don’t turn your head away."
"you are responsible (too), so start to save your soul."
consumer of this slavery for the taste on your palate…
do you know the price they have to pay?
can you ignore their hell everyday?
blood covers your conscience…profit stops your pity!
silver stars in my black night
"cold as ice, but beautiful"
wandering through broken shadows
the river of life is all filled with sins
the water i drink is the blood on my hands
no one sees how i'm burning
no one feels this yearning
so come taste this black poison
you never reach this heart
and forgive my obsession
something tears me apart
from myself
silver stars in my black night
"cold as ice, but beautiful"
wandering through broken shadows
the river of life is all filled with sins
the water i drink is the blood on my hands
waiting for my dammation
your prosecutor's here
in my own accusation
you can't run from yourself
oh we're living these lies all alone
so come on and throw the stone
silver stars in my black night
"cold as ice, but beautiful"
wandering through broken shadows
the river of life is all filled with sins
the water i drink is the blood on my hands
pray to the gods i have sold in this game
of live and let die
pray for my soul in this world
to deliver me from my sins
pray...
all that's been and all i see now
only a ghost of what i called...
silver stars in my black night
"cold as ice, but beautiful"
wandering through broken shadows
the river of life is all filled with sins
silver stars in my black night
"cold as ice, but beautiful"
wandering through broken shadows
the river of life is all filled with sins
the water i drink is the blood on my hands
the blood on my hands
the blood on my hands
the blood on my hands
fight hard
live fast
play loud
step out of the crowd
iron
rulin'
steel bent
forever the faith will live on in our hearts
there's nothing else in all the world
that will bring it down
we will play our wildest step to all around
we need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood
power
burnin'
brains out
united metallians ready to strike
white heat
red hot
mayhem
if you don't feel it you won't understand
there's nothing else in all the world
that will bring it down
we will play our wildest step to all around
we need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood
heavy metal is the law that keeps us all united free
a law that shatters earth and hell
heavy metal can't be beaten by any dynasty
we're all wizards fightin' with our spell
no flickering light at the end of the path
confront repressions of the past
fear... prevail... insanity... obey!
draw back in silence to dwell in anxiety
"no matter where i am, i'm alone"
my dreams are shattered
into thousand running tears
"the tears keep dripping down, down,"
"deep, down from my veins"
i'm walking towards dead end i'm walking all alone
two steps behind insanity
there's no starlight guiding my way throught this downward death row
soon will be the time i have to go...
little by little the end is drawing near
another night and so little blood to spare
(ya can hurt me... but ya can't possess me 'y know...)
"kill me, hurt me, fuck me, rape me, you won't have me!"
"draw back in silence to dwell in anxiety,"
"no matter where i am, i'm alone. i'm crying outloud"
"the tears of blood i bleed, so fuck the world,"
"i'll go now, i don't care. (who cares?)"
"i'm walking towards dead end, and i'm walking all alone"
two steps ago i past insanity
there's no starlight guiding my way out this downward death row
so now is the time i have to go
waaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!
[music: t. exxel - words: r. mythiasin]
[solo eggi]
i've been traveling on this road a long time.
the lonely journey of my destiny.
"along way i see so many things that shape me,"
carry ne into infinity.
in the end will i understand?
"receive the answers to the questions in my mind,"
is there a reason why we all are here?
"when my body's gone and my time here now has ended,"
"will i be forsaken, or somehow be remembered?"
in the end will i understand? in the end...
"at the end of this lonely road i've traveled down,"
will i finally make it home or forever be alone?
"all my life i've waited for some kind of answer,"
in the end will i understand?
will a familiar face apper to guide my way?
the way i've lived my life has led up to this way.
"when i meet my maker and the one true god of all,"
"will my sins be forgiven, or into darkness will i fall?"
"deep within my soul i hear the voices call,"
"telling me my time is near, the ending after all"
will i be afraid knowing i can't hide?
will i finally be at peace on the other side?
"ah, ah! the ending after all! the ending after all..."
i'm walking down this broken road
i've never been here before
"so fucking bored, i can't explain"
(it doesn't mean a thing)
i'm going lower
than i ever dreamt of going before
so fucking low i can't explain
(i can't explain the pain)
so what i'd rather be numb
you know what i'd never be numb
so what i'd rather be numb
from the sex and the drugs
and the spotlight too
you know what i'd never be numb
from the pain and the blame
and the black and blue
so what i'd rather be numb
"so what, so what"
i asked my mother what she'd do
if she could do it again
she said she'd probably do the same
(she wouldn't change a thing)
forgive me father for i know
not why i'm drowning in sin
i guess i do it all in vain
(it doesn't mean a thing)
so what i'd rather be numb
you know what i'd never be numb
so what i'd rather be numb
from the sex and the drugs
and the spotlight too
you know what i'd never be numb
from the pain and the blame
and the black and blue
"so put me under again, i don't mind"
"put me under again, i feel fine"
can you hold me again before i die?
put me under (put me under)
put me under again
i'm walking down this broken road
i've never been here before
so fucking bored i can't explain
(i can't explain the pain)
"so what, i'd rather be numb"
you know what i'd never be numb
so what i'd rather be numb
from the sex and the drugs
and the spotlight too
you know what i'd never be numb
from the pain and the blame
and the black and blue
"so what, i'd rather be numb"
"so what, so what"
"so what, i'd rather be numb"
"so what, so what"
life!
things keep ending up this way
(come and get off)
another notch is carved away
in the thoughts of mass decay
funny how things end up this way
"beaten down, dominated by its sound"
growing deep within my head
"softly dying, its soul is shed"
eating me all up inside
this cancer finds everything i hide
living my life horrified
nothing will keep this pacified and out my life
"life, just know that i'm insane"
satisfaction is delayed (come and get off)
its motivation is displayed
finding its misogyny
funny how i die and go away (come and get off)
"beaten down, dominated by its sound"
growing deep within my head
"softly dying, its soul is shed"
eating me all up inside
this cancer finds everything i hide
living my life horrified
nothing will keep this pacified and out my life
"life, just know that i'm insane"
i'm constantly beat up inside
and i'm the one to blame
no one can relate to me
it's not like i'm insane
"beaten down, dominated by its sound"
living my life horrified
nothing will keep this pacified and out my life
"beaten down, dominated by its sound"
growing deep within my head
"softly dying, its soul is shed"
eating me all up inside
this cancer finds everything i hide
living my life horrified
nothing will keep this pacified and out my life
"life, just know that i'm insane"
changing ending troubling times a bomb left on your door
causing great discomfort as your house has just exploded
the rivers overflowing and the dimming of the sun
"the hazardous carcinogens, the poisons in your lungs"
changing ending troubling times another love that's lost
humiliating consequence don't ever show you're soft
keeping pain inside you the heartaches never gone
"feel the warmth of a brand new day, the healing of the sun"
did you see that i saw that?
i saw that the end was right now
have you seen that? you saw that?
the time to get out is right now
changing ending troubling times a life consumed by debt
running out of fortune with expenditures you've missed
property foreclosing and diminishing of funds
the overdrawn the federal laws have put you on the run
changing ending troubling times a new life to be born
another soul in danger; in eternity turmoil
the future is so bleak and the casualties grow higher
throwing us in prison or sending us to war
did you see that i saw that?
i saw that the end was right now
have you seen that? you saw that?
the time to get out
the time to get out is right now
the time to get out
the time to get out is right now
changing ending troubling times
get a little grip on tomorrow
make sure you get through the day
get a little grip on tomorrow
take a little trip to the other side
of what you're in store for
go consult an oracle
see the blank page you signed up for
we don't know what the future may bring
the sorrow tomorrow will bring
nothing we can do 'cept to give
a little smile to a fellow
i tell you better yet
prepare to have to go it all solo
we don't know what the future may bring
the sorrow tomorrow will bring
changing ending troubling times
changing ending troubling times
changing ending
changing ending
change end
changing ending troubling times
get a little grip on tomorrow
take a little trip to the other side

a funeral moves. under the cloak of night
captain clegg and his smuggling pirates ride
with contraband of the finest brandy and wine
hidden inside a macabre coffin disguise
"a tombstone reads ""captain clegg, r.i.p."""
yet still he sails across the phantom seas
such a holy man for all of you to see
the village vicar: - his secret identity
"frightened people, fear the evil"
in their leader - captain clegg
the kings revenue men - learn of clegg's illicit deeds
from a local trader - now a corpse who no longer speaks
if you cross his path - he'll slice off both your ears
"have your tongue cut out, and reduce your life to tears"
perish all of you - who betray me
your ghostly leader - captain clegg
a few words from collier....
he wore the mask of the skeletal creature of night
"his oath was terror and ""blood!"" his battle cry"
"he was a wanted man, who escaped the hangman's noose"
the parish leader - his pirate clergy in the loose
"he sailed the phantom seas, catered for community needs"
the village master - captain clegg
he was a ghost rider - phantom night creature
evil leader: - captain clegg. r.i.p.
"i'm back again, back in the evil night, and you're waiting"
"doomed by the living dead, flames are rising, can't you see you're dying"
"the wolves are howlin', a baby's cry in the distance, cold winds"
blowing
"in the dead of night, flames are rising, can't you see you're dying"
"no way to survive this evil night, if the dead won't leave you alone"
"so just say goodbye to all your holy angels, you're gonna die"
"long black hair, face like a dead, i am here, satan in my head"
"you can't see nothing but confusing mirrors, now you feel it"
"it's getting nearer, flames are rising, can't you see you're dying"
"so dark in your mind, breath of satan in my back, i can't help you"
"cause i'm one of the dead, flames are rising, can't you see you're dying"
"no way to survive this evil night, if the dead won't leave you alone"
so just say goodbye to all your fuckin' angels.
engulfed in the innards
of rotting cadavers a rancid gore sea
asphyxiation
tangled intestines become my reality
choking on guts
asphyxiation gasping for breath
drowning in viscera
slowly to taper away dissipate
absorbing this ultimate carnage
surrounding me
soaking in entrails decayed
decomposed
entombed without reason
in moist isolation of repugnancy
morose sensation
covered completely as terror
"enhances pain, to suffocate"
morose sensation gasping for breath
drowning in viscera
"sinking in this tamped hell, pestilent"
smothered in heaping chunks
stinking flesh putrefies
decomposition ensures burial
inundated languid doom
[solo: pat]
"iniquity, submerged ending"
"primeval swamp, sanguinary"
inescapable abuse
[solo: jack]
"starting to fade, blood saturates"
"deadly embrace, immolated"
imbrued with pus of the dead
eviscerate another life gutted soul
"morbidity, obliterate"
engrossing plight fatal rot
consuming scum
drenched in evil excrement
sent to a world to die in pain by
drowning in viscera
engulfed in the innards
of rotting cadavers a rancid gore sea
asphyxiation
tangled intestines become my reality
choking on guts
morose sensation gasping for breath
drowning in viscera
eviscerate another life gutted soul
"morbidity, obliterate"
engrossing plight fatal rot
consuming scum
drenched in evil excrement
sent to a world to die in pain by
drowning in viscera
a battle on distant shore
seawolves warth sweep the land
down from the skies valkyries ride
and walk the field halowed by tyr
"the fight is hard, axes are swung"
"swords bite sharp, men are slewn"
"the ground turns red, bloodsoaked field"
dead man's last bed and odin sees
"vikings fall, in blood they lie"
"the webs of norn's, they've met their fate"
with shield and sword they've benn brought in pride
to the mighty doors of the speargod's hall
the gates open and into the hall of braves
the silently walk
the one-eyed sits in glory mighty
raises his cup and says:
"""pa vida fð´ltet"
hð´rmð´n svingat
det blanket svð´rdet
och banen mñ†tt
till den hñ†ges sal
de i ð”ra fñ†rts
och vid mjñ†det hñ†r
"odin kvð´da"""
"dawn breaks, the einherjer go to"
relive their fight
with passion swords held high
as they ride in the morning mist
"the sun warms the air, warcries sound"
tor hjelpe! the battle begins
charging horses with fire breath
"rush to battle, in glory die!"
"swords sing in joy, again they cut"
"with shining edges, bloodstained steel"
"axes shine, again they've been swung"
"ripping flesh, death be done"
and the cold night comes with charging darkness
to odin's hall the einherjer return
"a feast awaits, until the next day"
when warriors eyes again shall burn
i'm looking through a hole in the sky
i'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie
i'm getting closer to the end of the line
i'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine
i'm living in a room without any view
i'm living free because the rent's never due
the synonyms of all the things that i've said
are just the riddles that are built in my head
"hole in the sky, gateway to heaven"
"window in time, through it i fly"
i've seen the stars disappear in the sun
the shooting's easy if you've got the right gun
and even though i'm sitting waiting for mars
i don't believe there's any future in cause
"hole in the sky, take me to heaven"
"window in time, through it i fly"
yeah
i've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
i've seen the western world go down in the east
the food of love became the greed of our time
but now i'm living on the profits of pride
clouds of insecurity obscure me
assure me
the mist of desperation
dripping down my skin
the crushing storm will break me
and take me from this state i'm in
everytime the rain comes calling
i can't stop myself from falling
into the darkness - into the madness
of a world devoid of fear and pain
everytime it rains
the waves of isolation
crash around me - around me
the loneliness of silence
echoes in my brain
with shore in sight i'm under
and wonder why i fought in vain
everytime the rain comes calling
i can't stop myself from falling
into the darkness - into the madness
of a world devoid of fear and pain
everytime it rains
when a new day reaches dawn
i feel it's worth the wait
but i tumble and i fall
i'm up against my fate
when the barricades come down
i'll build them up again
when i'm just about to drown
i still don't know the end
sometimes i tremble
like a little child
their faces mourning
with a broken smile
sometimes i crumble
when they're chasing through
sometimes i feel that
i could rule the world
when the morning come's alive
release your love brigade
at the end of day it's night
to suck it up with hate
sometimes i tremble
like a little child
their faces mourning
with a broken smile
sometimes i crumble
when they're chasing through
sometimes i feel that
i could rule the world
rule the world
sometimes i tremble
like a little child
their faces mourning
with a broken smile
sometimes i crumble
when they're chasing through
sometimes i feel that
i could rule the world
(their faces mourning
with a broken smile
sometimes i crumble
when they're chasing through
sometimes i feel that
i could rule the world)
"wonder and wait as i stare at the cross,"
"thinking in ways that have christ at a loss,"
"kick your ass out through the lord's pearly gates,"
when heaven burns and engulfed into flame.
"blasphemes villain, the killings begin,"
"murdering christians and torturing them,"
"conquering churches and slaughtering lambs,"
"doing it all for my love of satan... (i love you satan, my lord)"
"bring death to your god; tear apart his begotten son,"
"christian you are dead, fucking kill every one of them,"
"drop down in defeat, retribution of hypocrisy,"
"in life is unknown, after here i will own your soul."

"blasphemy.... when heavens burns we inherit the earth,"
"no more lies, churches and crosses confusing the mind,"
"agony watching them burn in their righteous empire,"
"when heaven burns i will dance in its fire,"
"drop dead hyraces, paradise has begun to bleed,"
"give praise to the lord, over run in the face of war,"
"christian wait with death, heaven burns into nothingness."
satan on his throne rejoice in returning home.
"end of god, when heaven burns it will fall to the earth,"
"watch it burn angels on fire and screaming berserk,"
"holy ghost, lost in confusion and puking in pain,"
when it burns pissing on prophets that fall to the flame.
"wonder and wait as i stare at the cross,"
"thinking in ways that have christ at a loss,"
"kick your ass out through the lord's pearly gates,"
when heaven burns i will stomp on his face.
"blasphemes villains, the killings begin,"

"conquering churches and slaughtering lambs,"
doing it all for my love of satan.

another dream
another fight
keep on movin' down the line
gypsy woman on my mind
ask no questions tell no lies
see the answers in my eyes
she's a rock 'n roll gypsy
don't go breaking my heart
she's a rock 'n roll gypsy
she's gonna tear me apart
"hey gypsy, uh, you're breakin' my heart, yeah"
"tear me apart, uh, yeah"
white line fever
takes me high
another city
another lie
another town
another face
another woman to take your place
catch the bullet
ride the storm
drive me crazy 'till the dawn
like an eagle flying high
look for freedom in the sky
she's a rock 'n roll gypsy
don't go breaking my heart
she's a rock 'n roll gypsy
she's gonna tear me apart
she's a rock 'n roll gypsy
don't go breaking my heart
she's a rock 'n roll gypsy
yeah
welcome to our fortress tall
take some time to show you around
impossible to break these walls
for you see the steel is much too strong
computer banks to rule the world
instruments to sight the stars
possibly i've seen to much
hangar 18 i know too much
foreign life forms inventory
suspended state of cryogenics
selective amnesia's the story
believed foretold but who'd suspect.
the military intelligence
two words combined that can't make sense
possibly i've seen to much
hangar 18 i know too much
"why will you deny the fact, that you have never won"
"when you play the final act, your fate has just begun"
"you’re suffering from amnesia, forgotten what you did"
"but on the floor the corpses lie, a crime you did"
commit
"1st degree murder, straight to the chair you’ll go"
"1st degree murder, it’ll be your final show"
"you must recieve your punishment, as written by the"
law
"accepting what the jury said, you have to die you know"
"1st degree murder, straight to the chair you’ll go"
"1st degree murder, it’ll be your final show"
"tonight’s the night you’ll wait no more, your final"
hour’s near
"behind the bars where you reside, reach out and touch"
the fear
"you never notice time could run, as fast as it does"
now
"there’s no excuse, no miracles, no where, no what, no"
how
"the chair awaits you silently, have you got any final"
words?
"a cigaret, a meal maybe? a ticket off this world"
a minister will ask you to confess to all your sins
"you ask him if he’s got a lifetime, the devil in you"
wins
"you went out to do your deed, the darkness in your"
mind
"the voices deep within your head, commands you to do"
crime
"controlled by an unnamed source, from deep within"
yourself
"you’re just a schizophreniac, so may you rot in hell"
"1st degree murder, straight to the chair you’ll go"
"1st degree murder, it’ll be your final show"
"the pardon that you hoped for, got stuck somewhere in"
time
"so now you’ve gotta take what’s coming, get punished"
for your crime
"so down the hallway you will go, to ride the chair of"
light
"the is your lead role, you’re the one, lights, camera,"
action
"the plans, of a race gone mad"
a final solution to pass
all dreams are taken from their lives
no hope for the young all the old realize
he is but a solitary man
whose prejudice will spread like a flame
throughout the land
he's enslaving those who will be free
"etching his own name in black,"
for all of us to hear and see
a yellow star for those accused
there's no escape once you've been pinned
a relocation only to confuse
and all their propaganda to hide the awful truth
screams-in the night
scars so deep that they won't mend
screams-in the night
screams-in the night
in their souls they can't pretend
screams-in the night
six million lives on the hands of heads of state
they followed orders from above
then one man when all was lost
"he took his life, he'll never pay the price"
they cannot hide or defend or disguise
for the truth is well known there's be no alibis
judgment will pass and their tales
won't be kind
for the final solution was mass genocide
"day by day, watching you disappear"
wishing that you were still here beside me
"on my own, swimming against the tide"
there’s nobody on my side but your memory
then you’ll rise right before my eyes
on wings that fill the sky
like a phoenix rising
like a phoenix rising
"wings on fire, tearing into the night"
screaming into the light of another day
carry me out the hurricane
into the smoke and flame and we’ll fly away
and we’ll rise right before their eyes
on wings that fill the sky
like a phoenix rising
like a phoenix rising
"higher, higher, hear the thunder roar from above"
"fire, fire, fire makes me whole"
into the smoke and flame and we’ll fly away
and we’ll rise right before their eyes
on wings that fill the sky
like a phoenix rising
like a phoenix rising
"wings on fire, tearing in to the night"
and we’ll fly away
[2] knights of the cross
winners of the battle
the christians rule the holy land
in the east they settle hugo de payens
a frenchman and duke
promises the king of jerusalem
to escort the piligrim route
we are the monks
protectors of god
a legend is born
worship the lord
monks of war
killers in the east
monks of war
killers or priests
[2] the order explands
thousands prepare
to wearing the cross in red
to holy warfare
[3] the poor and the rich
kings and queens
giving money giving gold
hugo de payens means
pope and priests
patronize the order
and they regard them
as heroes of this time
revealed are the legends coronal
in a fiery illusion
an esoteric festival
the logical is trapped in confusion
unmasked are theorems of invocation
consigned to the thirsty soul
parallel dimension's fragmentation
with a stronghold in a black hole
where phantoms channel the connection
in a metaphysical drama
like maxwell's demon if taught to perfection
"my eyes, the soul's panorama"
at childhood i felt a concealed motion
(wisdom through the mother's milk)
"waves in the interstellar ocean,"
shapes under veils of silk
still they let me feel their presence
"the archetype around me, inside me"
in every atom and second their essence
as well as in the vibration frequency of the open sea
rainbows in colours never seen
in symbioses with nordic light that flashes in green
in rapids of blood glorious
and in the reckless fire victorious
i can trace their mark
by kwê
from the primeval mass
let precious chaos vent
sacred flesh drenched in fornication
beloved by set
may the winds gather her together
from the secrets of men
after thousands of years of terrifying silence
she comes again
(all destroyer)
the abolition of the yeshua begins...
shattered are the icons of the worthless
the goddess scorned is a valkyrie born
scattered are the wings of the virulent holy
leave their husks to be the prey of vultures and dogs
world without end
cherish the lissome wants of pernicious evil
dusk in her eyes
torn bloody weeping skies
darkness will hasten to devour
and the weak will flee or die
sie sind es die sich
anderlieb festhalten
fuer immer betend auf knien
vor der (finisteren) goetten
i slay the lamb in the fervour of thine
abandonment unto our lady
with a quenchless thirst for the infinite
for her that exists beyond all knowledge
storming from tired centuries
under the glare of a waxing death-moon
terrible beauty of love severed
rip the baby from the virginal womb
the blood of jesus
is the wine of the dead
and the drunken angels
bleed with incest
the liliot suckle on her fruitful breasts
and yield the swords that sever and stain
there will be no act or passion wrought
that shall not be attributed to her names
to the name of baphomet...
"artemis, bastet, astarte"
i yearn to thee who art darkness in thy rising
"""weltmacht oder niedergang"""
accept this bitter pain
accept this bitter pain
there's too many seasons have changed
there's too many reasons to change
and when did you decide
when id gone?
and when did you decide to breakdown
when id gone?
your wrath has being unchained
your wrath has being unchained
there's too many feeling estranged
there's too many leaving the stage
and when did you decide
when id gone?
and when did you decide to breakdown
when id gone?
i saw a cadillac driving to the wishing well
a sweet illusion or a secret from hell
"i was paralyzed, kinda hypnotized"
and the time stood still
if dollars were dirt
gold and honey
i'll be watching you
if dollars were dirt
gold and honey
i can see the truth
there's no one scared and nothing left
was it my lucky day or am i a jerk
"your shadow's still here, do you live in fear"
is this superstition
if dollars were dirt

i'll be watching you

he is an empty shell
- shell-shocked luciferian soul
he is an empty shell
- drained and sealed
he is an empty shell
- penetrating cold
he is an empty shell
- empty luciferian soul
how furiously and bombastic
he proclaimed his destruction
of a mortal coil
in the end it seemed
this was his only possession
"long past were his ""glorious"" days"
of filth and lies
and he has reached out to stop time
at its end
he is an empty shell
- shell-shocked luciferian heart
he is an empty shell
- drained and sealed
he is an empty shell
- penetrating cold
he is an empty shell
- empty luciferian soul
the constant struggle for a moment of quiet indulgence
eventually stirred and quaked the earth so hard
it swallowed him in a dark and heavy cloud
slowly and gently starving him into insanity
an inferno of ice
with an ever burning
bleeding
heart
summoned to the house of seance
to play the evil tarot cards
to find out what our fate will bring us
before the war
approaching now the hour of tiamat
evil feelings in the air
the chosen wait impatiently
to find the rituals of power
come out of the fire
making the legacy known
takes its toll at last
now knowing when it strikes
the endless feuding shows its fate
the people are all shocked with fright
they know the end is coming near
it's time to fight
the revolution holds on strong
the armies have all met their match
entire world up in arms
destruction sees the spirits of anger
come up from the gallows
conjured my demons appear
"summoned to my cast,prey this deadly mass"
takin by the fire you fail
the world became a vast wasteland
survivors turn to cannibals
killing everything in sight
warfare tonight
the armies are all closing in
the populations getting small
feelings are as cold as ice
survival names it's price
starting to burn
the rape and violence grows high
a kingdom will rise
to rule with contempt
they will surprise
kill and repent
the weakness in armies
"""won't die"""
leaving now the house of seance
speculating destiny
wonder if the cards were true
and this love will be the death of me
blank eyes see no end
pulse is weak
your skin is turning blue
i can't let go of you
hope is gone t
he light is dim again
i'm praying for a sign
fragile hearts
a face so porcelain
this blow surely break you
i am at the end of all of life's decisions
it's not too late
"can you, will you please be there for when it all comes down?"
in slow motion
i'll hold on to this empty shell
it's everything i have
lower me into the ground before all of these crumbles onto me
and i will hold you
and i will hold you down
alive to see your death
you'll never make a sound
and i will hold you
and i will hold you down
you'll be forever
and never make a sound
father ov terror!
abu ol-hol
enter the pylon
thru' the galleys ov past
catacombs ov night
into the starry womb
"slay, slay!"
asar un-nefer
we have no fear
our time had come
our will is done
"dance, dance!"
o mighty one
in the fields ov aqert
and spit
upon slaves ov death
war god!
trample all weakness
this is your day ov pride
draw thy flaming sword
cut the umbilical cord
to set me free from eternal sleep...
lead: seth
... step by step
khem: evolution: spiral vibration
can you hear?
can you touch?
can you see?
can you really see?
we charm all jins -
"automata, inprinted realities"
they creep like snakes
and all we feel
is painful bliss
as we burn forth
like winged globe
like solar disk...
...and penetrate eternity
lead: nergal
slaves shall serve!
steamin' for your love tonight
won't you lay me down
walkin' over looking hot and sweet
babe you're hard to beat
it's time to get together with me babe
won't ya lay me now
know it's your first time for love
let me show you how
steamin' for your love tonight
steamin' for your love
steamin' for your love tonight
steamin' for your love
just relax and let your body go
"don't fight the feeling, oh no"
reaching heights you've never reached before
won't you let me blow
now it's done and you feel released
from your mad desire
mine is blowin' out tonight
won't you set the fire
go!
"forever falling, into oblivion"
the darkness crawls forward
"it engulfs, my will to live"
fear is failure
and this is my motivation
take back what was stolen
reclaim all thats lost
"with virtue, i will rise up from the ruins"
c'mon!
"through adversity, there is redemption"
"with passion, fighting"
i am unbroken
"through adversity, there is redemption"
"with passion, fighting"
"i am, unbroken!!"
take back what was stolen
embrace the cycle
refuse to turn back now and be led astray
fear is failure
and this is my afirmation
"through adversity, there is redemption"
"with passion, fighting"
i am unbroken
"through adversity, there is redemption"
"with passion, fighting"
unbroken!!
"the absence of fear, is the renewal of ourself"
"the absence of doubt, breeds desire"
if there is truth to face
i will design it
i will not be denied!
eritis sicut dii
thus sermonized the serpent ov eden
thus struck the breath ov the earth
and thus flooded the blood ov the soil
slither into the gaping void!
"i worship thee, o vicious man!"
now mark my words ye mortal race
feed my wrath with lion's gore
feed my envy with the fat ov lambs
as the wicked ways will flourish
behold the monuments ov god decay
"lex divinus, i stamp the dust"
i despoil the holy books
like dead leaves wither they to ash
as i am leading the hosts ov stars
"onwards, embrace the sun"
in absentia dei
we sermonize
in ecclesia satani
thy might is right!
i have watched the birth ov planets
i have witnessed the death ov worlds
i've conducted the choir ov stars
i have ridden the tail ov the comet
(as i've transformed)
from god to ash
from dust to man
in absentia dei we evangelize
in absentia christi we spread like swarming plagues
in ecclesia satani
thy might is right!
we live and die like all the rest
every summer has its sunset every year
love and hope put to the test
every grain of comfort holds the seed of fear
and i loved you long ago
and i love you still
but the roads that we have tavelled
took us far apart
scattered to the four winds
someday we will find the time to heal
and i loved you long ago
and the stars that bear my name
are the wounds that never heal
but the road that we have travelled
took us far apart
and i love you still
and i loved you long ago
"well, there's no more big time"
no more bright lights
just a guy who's drinking alone tonight
shoulda walked back your mouth
knocked you off your high horse
with all that worthless advice you endorse
lost the limelight you were about
what's it like to gradually fade out
"used to tear it all down, now you're tearing all up"
got 'em drippin' in your whiskey at the brass mug
i've heard it all before
the murmurs and the whispers
i don't listen anymore
"every time i rise, you fall away"
it's the same story day after day
you're voice is like poison
you can't be me
"every time i rise, you fall away"
fall away
"nothin's lost, we just don't abuse it"
"we're seven deep, we been caught up writing hits"
"now you whine, cry, bitch, moan, say it's a waste"
sing along while i give you a taste
"yeah, here's to you and your favorite band"
"yeah, they suck too"
i hear your cries to the one you know you idolize
i've heard it all before
the murmurs and the whispers
i don't listen anymore
"every time i rise, you fall away"
it's the same story day after day
you're voice is like poison
you can't be me
"every time i rise, you fall away"
fall away
"keep tellin' those tall tales, and i'll call you out"
every time i rise you fall away
"all those worthless years, they're fading away"

when i was but very young
sorcerers came to claim my mind
leaving death and hatred to unmask
the master of the game had won
and let his final sin be known
killing those who stand in his path
alone in the dark
where the demons are torturing me
the dark passages of revenge is all that i see
armies of witches
are called in from the north
murders of elders occur
the high priest of evil
has lowered his iron fist
thousands of people will die
the slaughter of the innocent
the house is burning
that lights the sky
my nightmare has begun to unfold
the hissing of the cobras tongue
sound and feel of ripping flesh
fall two thousand feet from the sky
my terror has controlled my life and
let my only weakness known
i got to rid this hell from my head
i fight off evil sorcerers
rid my mind of his torture and
meet the falling angel in his realm
faustus prepares the legions of the night
diviners from the far north arrive
aimlessly people there huddled in a pack
wreaking deadly havoc on mankind
i fall in my deepest sleep
to meet the evil asteroth
his title is the grand duke of hell
i fight until the end is near
to rid my mind of hopes and fears
my destination lies in my dreams
set me free

"on seventh day,"
is that how it's done?
twisting your eyes to perceive
all that you want
to assume from ignorance
inflicting wounds with your
cross-turned dagger
inside crystal mountain
evil takes its form
inside crystal mountain
commandments are reborn
all the traps are set to confine
all who get in the way of the divine

a slave to the curse forever confined

your head's on the clock and still you threaten
a wretched way of life for those that choose and abuse

"believe, empty words a false doctrine"
blooded in your holy word's goal
look what you did so fucking sick it's what you did

you represent your discontent slaughtering the innocent

targed acquired
we open fire

annihilation
so many come and go
they're changing like the wind

well i've only got one mission
and i will stand my ground

this is a retribution
this is my revenge

commited 'til the end

this is what i do it for
but to the leeches
the liars and the thieves
just know i always win the war

"no life, just consume what you attach to"
"failure, now hang on others and try to fill the hollow"
"pathetic, weak, laughable"
you live to follow wantless admiration
"shameless you dig for status, on your knees crawl"

"intruding nature, demanding one to play the roll"
you're not worth my time
ya damn hanger on
you've got a long way to go
you're still dead wrong
"now dot the map, bring the gifts you offer"
as a payment for your audience
stand up worship bow down to your knees
intrenched within a culture that exploits the offers
relish in the excess
pathetic your punishment we must endure
validation becomes an all consuming goal
"intruding nature, demanding one to play the roll"
you're not worth my time
ya damn hanger on
you've got a long way to go
you're still dead wrong
you know that trust can not be bought
and still know doubt of your return
you can't pretend to know my heart
and no we're not of the same cloth
you're not worth my time
ya damn hanger on
you've got a long way to go
you're still dead wrong

"run, hide my eyes from the sun,"

i need a new direction
another thought to serve me right
my mind has got an infection
and there's nothing that seems to help
i need to grow an island somewhere inside my head
"where nothing can disturb me,"
"where i am free, where i'm forever set"
maybe it's not important
if we are dead or alive.
i never ever wanna listen to the sirens
"i'm alive, still alive."
"who says: ""we are not guilty"""
"i say: ""we never know the way it goes"""
"changes - all around me, all inside my head"
"changes - changing face, still remaining mad."
changes - an all day routine.
"hard to enjoy the good times,"
decay is what i feel
"god, it's makin' me porous, vanish in haze,"
"i wonder, wonder if i'm real."
newflash - under the new regulations
non-conformity will be punished by law.
relax - and don't forget to unplug your tv set!
sigh no more!
"for you, you are not guilty,"
"no, no, you're not responsible at all."
"changes - all around me, all inside my head"
"changes - changing face, still remaining mad."
changes - an all day routine.
"changes - all around me, all inside my head"
"changes - changing face, still remaining mad."
"changes - changing systems, still insane."
changes - but the madness will remain.
who is the man who says i'm never gonna die?
"it's a lie, it's a lie!"
"and who is the man who says, i never have to sigh?"
"it's a lie, it's a lie!"
"oppression, resistance"
"we will never change our way,"
the island in my mind is growin'
"more and more, day after day."
"changes - all around me now, all inside me now"
"changes - wanna cry no more, sigh no more."
expel at cost
i've looked for valuation
return what's lost
ive thrived on agitation
i live in fear
fear of my contradiction
free my eyes of fire
"greed, my heart desires"
im free this way
no love is lost
no love of condescending
who do i trust?
trusting or just pretending
maybe its wrong.
maybe im speculating
free my eyes of fire
"greed, my heart desired"
im free this way
the path i cross
is strewn with alterations
all at a loss
bargain infatuation
why did i try?
cause it's so complicated
i free my eyes of fire
"greed, my heart desired"
"the human confrontation,i've made up phobia"
it makes my essence something
"someone takes me, take control"
i may not far from rocking
i am the one alone
i may not far behind line
and made them turn away
"i want to tell you, why you watch out!"
"i've made them turn to cripple, why you watch out!"
when i would know who'll now back fight
why time would let me die to control
"i feel nothing ,but lack of space"
i rip my mind and but lack of space
i feel no one why you turn back
i may not live
my freedom cant contain but tell me
the pain i liberate
riff hostility to anyone
has made us so much hate
i made them turn for hate bt tell me
the pain and suffering
i made them turn for hate bt tell me
the pain and suffering
i...............
you know my friend
i've been walking on a really strange path lately
i'm so glad you were not there
"to see my fall, to see me passing on"
"my wound so deep, my veins opened wide"
letting flow my distress
letting flow my requests
listen my friend as no one wanted to hear
i'm telling you now
"so weak was my hope, so cold the world around"
"so strong the calls, my pain invited echoes to my hurt"
anguish coiled in the gut like a starving worm
"fallen, between, i slide down the hole at the centre of my soul"
"i've given up, i've given up, larvae rots"
by all the gods of the pit
i command that those things of which
"i speak, shall come to pass!"
come forth and answer your names
by manifesting my desire!
i see your pain i see it grow
slowly inside you
you cannot control it
"the hurting's ruthless, you cannot win"
i see every smile you fake
"strong emotion, strong devotion to ignore the pain"
to stand strong
"day after day, to be there for us, always"
to pretend there's nothing wrong
how you feel or how it feels
no words describe it
your body feels like a stranger
"we cannot stop it, we cannot win"
i see every smile you fake
"strong emotion, strong devotion to ignore the pain"
to stand strong
i see every smile you fake
"strong emotion, strong devotion to ignore the pain"
to stand strong
"every painful day, i'll be there for you, always"
and together we will stand strong
only you know my pain inside
you've been there when no one else could be
when tears fall from my eyes
i know that you are always there
no matter what's in my heart
you are the one who cares
"when i doubt, you stand by me"
so i'm not ashamed to say the way i feel
"i love you, you are my everything"

"last night when i drove home they were there, this is true"
they hung in the air above the motorway
then they came down to me
a phosphorising light piercing me and the
"time, it stood still on the motorway"
then they came down to me
"a phosphorising light piercing me and the time, it stood still"
"i've heard from a neighbour, he saw them at home."
"they stood before his window watching him, so"
"maybe they first want to study our life,"
"yeah, they study our life."
before they get in contact with us they must know who we are.
do you know 'bout the u.f.o.'s
maybe there's more life than we know
"what comes now? i am eager to know,"
will they come back and clear our doubts?
without a trace they came and left us in a mess
"finally all the world will see,"
"rise again before the endless silence,"
"look at the soul before we'll all be free,"
"light the path beneath a blackened, blackened sky."
"one final sacrifice, this night belongs to me,"
"turn back before the dawn of winter,"

"through my mind tonight, our journey ever after."

"so cold and dark, the voice of sadness,"
"suffering enormous pain, the truth of all to be,"
crawling back to life through ever-blinding darkness.

"souls fearless, pain reveal us, rise now they are gone,"
"and as they ride away foresake the one to save us,"
"winter storming ever last fallen world,"

"won't you wait for the silence so strong,"
wait for the dawn.
"tonight, falling like the rain in silent teeming song,"
"feel the shattered dreams, one thousand voices crying,"
"raging endlessly they come, whoa,"
"and the morning light the high, the darkened days gone by,"
"and the sun will shine again across the blazing skies,"
"glorious eternally we'll rise above the world,"
"marching on to victory we fight,"
the fire still burns...
"looking back out past the lives, their memories to see,"
"flick through the passages of silence,"
"hidden by the sacrifice to set the demons free,"
now they understand reflame the land relentless.
"fear calling, transforming, stand alone in our time,"
"agrigation, decimation, slay the vision divine,"
"and all the stars fall around the world tonight,"
"silent forces from a past life return,"
"wait for the silence in a world so alone,"
"til' we touch the horizon beyond,"
fly through the storm.
"tonight, falling like the rain in silent teeming song,"
"feel the shattered dreams, one thousand voices crying,"
"raging endlessly they come, whoa,"
"and the morning light the high, the darkened days gone by,"
"and the sun will shine again across the blazing skies,"
"glorious eternally we'll rise above the world,"
"marching on to victory we fight,"
the fire still burns...
"the tears in your eyes,"
"a lifetime of misery,"
"in silence we stand all alone for the fate of our own destiny,"
"a lifetime of lies,"
"one chance at this fantasy,"
the judgement will pass for the cries of the world that has faded from me.

went into the plane was scared like hell
tried to relax for awhile
but when we took off i feared we would fall
waving goodbye to this life
i'm flying through winds tonight
no sign of the dawn or light
silhouettes in the sky
wings are carrying me through the night
silhouettes in the sky
destination unknown - distant skies
then after awhile i tried to sleep
but watched two movies instead
the fear struck again how i hate this plane
hope this would come to an end
i'm flying through winds tonight
no sign of the dawn or light
silhouettes in the sky
wings are carrying me through the night
silhouettes in the sky
destination unknown - distant skies
"hey one, yeah"
confusion un my head
was it something that i said
as i start to drink i begin to think
all the whiskey in a bottle is blood in my veins
as i keep believing this pain will go away
lightning strike my bloodshot eyes
am i asleep or wide awake
the self-inflicted misery
is feeding off my brain
it's left me feeling cold
"""as i begin to shake"""
i'm feeling cold
whiskey road take me home and wash away the pain
whiskey road leave me whole and wash me clean again
frustration i'm attacking myself
and no one understands just please let it end
every step forward is two steps back
"flashback, i feel it coming"
an' i'm feeling cold
"""as i refuse to break"""
so cold
"""so cold"""
whiskey road take me home and wash away the pain
whiskey road leave me whole and wash me clean again
who wants to separate
the world we know from our beliefs
and who sees only black and white
distinguish loss from sacrifice
some day we may come to peace
with the world within ourselves
and i will await you
until i close my eyes
when your time has come
you know you'll be lonely once again
and the final winter comes to us all
life is treacherous
but you're not the only who must pretend
we're a second in time
we're the last in the line
of the prey that walks the earth
good and evil combined
i am the god in my own history
the master of the game
i may believe if she would come to me
and whisper out my name
sometimes i wonder where the wind has gone
if life has ever been
sometimes i wonder how belief alone
can cut me free from sin
when you close your eyes
mementos of summer retrieves your mind
like a drizzle afternoon cleans the air
when the winter blows
you're glad you remember you really tried
and it comes to an end
even winter... life fall
and we all have our beliefs
pray for mercy for all
i am a man without a mystery
the deal is done within
i will embrace the coldest winter breeze
and pay for every sin
[helena]
"victoria, non praeda"
memento mori
[mephisto]
"una voce... volo, non valeo"
dulce et decorum est
pro patria mori
memento mori
[ariel]
so subservant in your embrace
no more denial
no run away
this is the final
my last recall
and that's the price for what we learn
the more we know the more we yearn
cause we're so alone
i am a man without a mystery
the deal is done within
i will embrace the coldest winter breeze
the journey can begin
i'm still the god in my own history
i still believe that she will come to me
and whisper out my name
some day we will come to peace
and reach beyond behind the lies
and i will await you
until i close my eyes
"alright motherfuckers, listen up loud"
cause there's a new fucking sheriff in town
"and if you're with me, put your hands in the air"
cause this is a fucking takeover
"what's the matter, crybaby? are you fucking jealous"
or are you just pissed off cause you can't upstage us?
you know we can't be stopped
your time has just run out
you think you're so fucking tough
as if you started the scene
you should stop trying so hard
maybe if your mind was as open as your mouth
you'd understand that regardless of what anyone
"wears, looks like, or sings about"
we're all the same fucking kids
fighting for what we believe in
and you can never take that away
(bitch!)
since when did fashion make you part of this crime scene?
who gives a fuck if i wear makeup and tight jeans?
i can't take anymore
you're all the same with just a different name and different face
you're so caught up with all the bullshit on myspace
i can't take anymore
"(somebody call a tow-truck, cause this is a fucking breakdown!)"
don't ever fuck with our hearts
a knife to the throat will leave more than a scar
don't ever fuck with our hearts (woo!)
a knife to the throat will leave more than a scar
since when did fashion make you part of this crime scene?
who gives a fuck if i wear makeup and tight jeans?
i can't take anymore
you're all the same with just a different name and different face
you're so caught up with all the bullshit on myspace
i can't take anymore
(you!) on the count of three
(can't!) come on
(kill!) everybody now
(what you did not create!)
i will bury you
"look, the old bitch is back - yeah,"
finally we'll get some company again
the attic room has been
locked up for far too long - just like the
old bitch herself - she's on time
though - why that silly wheelchair?
oh she's pretending as always - but
she does make a good cup of tea.
"""oh my god she's here. missy, listen"
to what mother says: now you be
good to grandma; and remember
she's been away on a long vacation.
that goes for you too king. and stop
know your place in life is where you want to be
don't let them tell you that you owe it all to me
keep on looking forward; no use in looking 'round
hold your head above the ground and they won't bring you down
anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind

"new wonders in the world, wonders in the world,"
wonders in the world they wrought.

there's no one else
more worth living for

and the demon's whip
armies of the gods of hell ride across the atral plane
"bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave"

in the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky

to heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
"night winds, oblivion see my dark desire"
"come forth, appear he is living fire"

armies of the gods of hell ride across the atral plane
"bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave"

"lovecraft the day, bend it to wyrd ways"
"life wends, a masquerade"
where nothing is forever save the grave
and our desire burning
"look about us now, unbowed"
the world is furled in tragedy
and outed from the madding crowd
hurdles bless our destiny
when the moon is full
and the wolves howl in the forest
would you take my hand
and lead us both on our dark adventure?
would we share our dreams
those necromantic fantasies?
so could we ever be
apart when our hearts align like thunder?
do what thou wilt
never got their guilt
death purrs with a sombre lilt
precious hours as sylph and filth
are built on borrowed time
so let us fly
twin spirits joined as one inside
as countless devils hone damnation
we shall revel in our own salvation
before we die
before high judgement comes crashing nigh
let's seat our fates together
on the throne of paradise
"my soul was caricature, rest assured"
it hobbled cold and lame
then across my defenses of frost
"you came, eyes full of flame"
so when the stars spill out
and the nights are filled with terror
will you whisper truth
right us from their human error?
would we share our dreams
those necromantic fantasies?
so could we ever be
apart when our hearts align like thunder?
"love conquers all, love conquered me"
it put the magdalen on her knees
so breathe the magic in the air
tragic tastes sit everywhere
as heavens fix their wrathful eye
on man licking the planet dry
"of leavened tears, let's you and i"
just spread our wings
when the moon is full
and the wolves howl in the forest
would you take my hand
and lead us both on our final voyage?
would we share our dreams
those necromantic fantasies?
"really, could we ever be"
apart when our hearts lie six feet under?

sliding into deep depression
leaving such a magic time
away from all the world's intrusion
to find liberation in mind
you're just a fool and it's true
don't know what's going on around you
destroy your hope and your dreams
insatiablity speaks
support the cultural decay
sell and buy and betray
destroy your hope and your dreams
insatiablity speaks
the good vibes don't last
intoxication has past
next time i want more
give me some more than before
so far away from beyond and before
in a new kind of world where it's all unsure
step back again and remember the time
when your mind was free
"weak, can feel your body suffer"
i know what makes you insecure now
the ease of going on and abuse
commit a serious crime
to make the stuff all mine
i will get me everything
then i will live like a king
you're just a fool and it's true
don't know what's going on around you
insatiablity speaks
too far away from beyond and before
in a new kind of world where it's all unsure
step back again and remember the time
when your mind was free
times were changing
eighteen years and fading
ain't a lot of time left to be a star
on an island
all alone and dying
walk upon the water
but you won't get far
dreams and visions
tied into decisions
saw you on a postcard
from the other side
hope and glitter
never feeling bitter
walk upon the water
just to be your bride
don't tell me now
that there is nothing more
there is a how
just like there is a door
and if there's not to be another way
you tell me why
why
why
stay and follow
if the words are hollow
gotta' go along
cause it's all you got
each day earn them
turn around and burn them
think your fitting in
but you hope you're not
neatly drowning
every drink your downing
if you drink enough
you'll forget the game
each illusion
wrapped in absolution
live your life in weekends
but it's not the same
don't tell me now
that there is nothing more
there is a how
just like there is a door
and if there's not to be another way
you tell me why
why
why
why
and as he stood there cursing fate
for making life so hard
it seemed that fate had listened
for she dealt another card
for arriving in the harbour
silhouetted against the sky
was a ship bound for america
"and her name, ""maersk dubai"""
and so when no one else was looking
and the ship was safely moored
he waited for his moment
then he quickly snuck on board
then he found himself a hiding place
between two crates of iron ware
and as for distant america
in his mind he was already there
but what he was unaware of
as they sailed away from shore
was that there were other stowaways
and he was one of four
and meanwhile the old sailor
had walked right past that pier
while still conversing with the ocean
on the strengths of his idea
and as he walked he came upon
a youth he thought asleep
but the ocean said that he was not
and brushed a wave against his feet
and when the young man didn't stir
but lay quite still instead
the sailor took a closer look
and saw that he was dead
and all around the body
was something he had never seen
little cellophane packages
"marked ""blackjack guillotine"""
and so he asked the ocean
what these strange packets were
and she answered they held the heroin
that in his blood the youth had stirred
and it is certainly a sign
that things have gotten out of hand
when one can purchase ones own death
shadows on the wall
cold as ice
snd you break my heart
too many times
i don't wanna lose you
you passing by
i can't live without you
in the night
i just can't forget you
but love still the done
no will tomorrow
when you go
love is breaking my heart
running sips so strange
selled to the gone
you left my feelings
for behind
alone in my deep dreams
deep in my mind
i feel your poison
makes me blind

there's a lady who's sure all
that glitters is gold
and she's buying a stairway to heaven
and when she gets there she knows
if the stores are all close
with a word she can get what she came for
oh
and she's buying a stairway to heaven
there's a sign on the wall
but she wants to be sure
'cause you know sometimes
words have two meanings
in a tree by the brook
there's a songbird who sings
sometimes all of our
thoughts are misgiving
oh it makes me wonder
oh it makes me wonder
there's a feeling i get
when i look to the west
and my spirit is crying for leaving
in my thoughts i have seen
rings of smoke through the trees
and the voices of those who stand looking
oh it makes me wonder
oh and it makes me wonder
and it's whispered that soon
if we all called the tune
then the piper will lead us to reason
and a new day will dawn
for those who stand long
and the forest will echo with laughter
woe oh
if there's a bustle in your hedgerow
don't be alarmed now
it's just a spring clean
for the may queen
"yes, there are two paths you can go by"
but in the long run
there's still time to change
the road you're on
and it makes me wonder
oh
your head is humming
and it won't go
in case you don't know
the piper's calling you to join him
"dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?"
and did you know?
your stairway lies on the whispering wind
and as we wind on down the road
our shadows taller than our souls
there walks a lady we all know
who shines white light and wants to show
how everything still turns to gold
and if you listen very hard
the tune will come to you at last
"when all are one and one is all, yeah"
to be a rock and not to roll
oh
and she's buying a stairway to heaven
"i'm drownin' in the ocean, lost out on the sea"
don't know where i'm goin' or who i'm suppose to be
"never knew the world could be such a cold, cold place"
everyone i knew always wore an angry face
i never had nothin' or no one to call my own
i've never been nothin' but all alone
big ol' world keeps spinnin' round
nobody cares about me
nobody cares about me
why should i care about anyone else
nobody cares about me
always feelin' like a stranger never felt like i belonged
the only time i got some attention was when i was spit upon
"every dream, every dream i had was borrowed"
"and when i gave them back, i gave back tomorrow"
i'm like an empty suitcase that's been left out in the rain
thrown in the lost in found never to be flamed
big ol' world comes crashin' down
"what about me, nobody asked if i wanted to be"
"satan's veil, the night so red"
another creature sighted
"the night's alright, the music's loud"
the feeling is so right
mission: destroy aliens
mission: destroy aliens

to be in there with him

"ride across the ocean, we fly by the stars"
pandora's box - i'll come inside
when you raised your voice to decide
who's in and out
do you know what you've done and what you let inside
that along the lamb you took the lion too
now you're looking down at me
in your image i've been created
and along with the right you see
you gotta deal with the left of me now
from my mind to my heart and to my feet
from my head to my toes and - owing to you - in between
to the holy land? you gotta be dreaming
territorial mission: we're led by the semen!
gagagago!
and the ride is on
wastelands are waiting to be found another day
"ride across the ocean, we fly by the stars"

pandora's box - i'll come inside

"long's the life, steeps the climb, i took the match"
"and lit the fire, fire"
"pain for the pain, my guts ache, built by the sin"
"that was taught by the father, the father"
now come and walk with me
a journey of a 1000 miles it starts with one step
"plowing out the rows, the bleeding of the rose"
a butterfly's wings can start tornados don't ya know
"harvesting the souls, burying the bones"
"deep is the hole, shovel's always full, i bit the dog"
"and beat the master, master"
"eye for an eye, tooth's been pulled, lost all control"
that was taught by the mother
"the mother, now come and walk with me"
"another feeble man, arms outstretched in a distant land"
wonders where it all went wrong
he's followed us too long
"another fallen man, that failed to make a stand"
"what have i done wrong, left here all alone"
"the voice inside my head, is it me or an alien"
"throw me down the stairs, since i just don't care no more"
"i can't take wind. i can't fight the storm, anymore"
"i don't have the will. i can't be the storm, anymore"
the hurricane's eye is like the calm before the storm
"darkening the shore, settling the score"
a butterfly's wings can start tornados don't ya know
"harvesting the souls, burying the bones, of old"
while he was asleep holding her hand
the dreams smouldered
"she opened her heart, he tore it apart"
gazed into his smile
he said he had constraint
he was ostracised and feint
she had gone over and under
a tattoo of a loser
these are the rings that fell apart
these are the things that tore his heart
these were the dreams that he was causing
these were the gleams that she was pausing
we're nothing but debris
floating on a silver lake
there's nothing left to take
as we slowly fall apart
we unite you through me
as we separate with fate
we're nothing but debris
"her words confound, dim and unsound"
daring the logic
"defying off-hand, nothing unplanned"
phase into the vile
"let me speak again, pursue the praise - not too soon"
in two yields construed by me and you
tracing the cause and case
as we stand here face to face
simple twofoldness is our brace
that makes it feel like you and me
opportunity isn't what we lost
we have lost our senses
walk with me now to another place
where no one else has been before
i'll never waste another day
searching to find the reason
why did i choose to play this game
"this goes too far, i'll take no more"
i played the part and took the blame
while you pretend nothing is real
life turned to night as you're asleep
"blood flowing down, is this a dream?"
"liar, you tempt me"
"liar, you tempt me"
i don't know what to do
no guilt is in my heart
i don't know what to do
i'm not the reason
i'll never waste another day
forever lost no reason
he never choose to play this game
taken too far out of control
"liar, you tempt me"
"liar, you tempt me"
i don't know what to do
no guilt is in my heart
i don't know what to do
i'm not the reason
i don't know what to do
no guilt is in my heart
i don't know what to do
i'm not the reason
i don't know what to do
no guilt is in my heart
i don't know what to do
i'm not the reason
i don't know what to do
no guilt is in my heart
i don't know what to do
i'm not the reason
sometimes i feel like a man that has to broken hands
all of this thrown at me sinking me neck deep in sand
"they can't kill me no more, i don't know what they say but it's lies"
underneath all this they should see the man that i am
all of my life i've been tried and then persecuted
"they can't kill me no more, i don't know what to say cause it's lies"
"undenied, cold shackles, inches from the knife"
"i defy, what's mine shall be but nothing stance,"
"the time, not surprised, it's the same to sleep as it is to rise"
death or life? look deeply into my eyes
"fire on fire, way to be and get a fucking ride"
"some desire, a ""fuck you"" soars through the sky lies"
no life's so short it can't turn around
you can't spend your life living underground
for from above you don't hear a sound
"and i'm out here, waiting"
i don't understand what you want me to be
"it's the dark you're hating, it's not who i am"
but i know that it's all that you see
no life's so short that it never learns
no flame so small that it never burns
no page so sure that it never turns
"and i'm out here, waiting"
i don't understand what you want me to be
"it's the dark you're hating, it's not who i am"
but i know that it's all that you see
"can you live your life in a day, putting every moment in play?"
never hear a word that they say as the wheels go around
"tell me if you win would it show - in a thousand years, who would know?"
as a million lives come and go on this same piece of ground
(simultaneously)
can you live your life in a day i've been waiting
putting every moment in play?
never hear a word that they say i don't understand what you want me to be
as the wheels go around
tell me if you win would it show it's the dark you're hating
"in a thousand years, who would know?"
"as a million lives come and go it's not who i am, but it is what you see"
on this same piece of ground
(simultaneously)

i've been waiting
i don't understand what you want me to be
it's the dark you're hating
"it's not who i am, but it is what you see"
2.
/can you live your life in a day
putting every moment in play?
/never hear a word that they say
as the wheels go around
/tell me if you win would it show
"in a thousand years, who would know?"
/as a million lives come and go
on this same piece of ground
3.
/tell me would you really want to
see me leave this night without you
/would you ever look about you
wondering where we might be
/new york is so far away now
"tokyo, berlin and moscow"
/only dreams from here but somehow
one day that world we will see
"(simultaneously again, except substitute this for stanza 1 and clip last three syllables"
of the last line of stanzas 2 and 3)
1.
i don't understand
i don't understand
i don't understand
i don't understand
i don't understand
i don't understand
i don't understand
i don't understand...
"(together, immediately)"
...what i see.
(solo)
(coda)
"i swear on tomorrow, if you take this chance"
"our lives are this moment, the music - the dance"
and here in this labyrinth of lost mysteries
i close my eyes on this night and you're all that i see
i can't remember anything
can't tell if this is true or dream
deep down inside i feel to scream
this terrible silence stops me
now that the war is through with me
"i'm waking up, i cannot see"
that there's not much left of me
nothing is real but pain now
hold my breath as i wish for death
"oh please god, wake me"
back in the womb it's much too real
in pumps life that i must feel
but can't look forward to reveal
look to the time when i'll live
fed through the tube that sticks in me
just like a wartime novelty
tied to machines that make me be
cut this life off from me
hold my breath as i wish for death
"oh please god, wake me"
now the world is gone i'm just one
oh please help me
hold my breath as i wish for death
"oh please god, help me"
darkness
imprisoning me
all that i see
absolute horror
i cannot live
i cannot die
trapped in myself
body my holding cell
"come on, get 'em up"
landmine
has taken my sight
taken my speech
taken my hearing
taken my arms
taken my legs
taken my soul
left me with life in hell
i had a friend many years ago
one tragic night he died
the saddest time of my life
for weeks and weeks i cried
through the anger and through the tears
i've felt his spirit through the years
"i'd swear, he's watching me"
guiding me through hard times
i feel it once again
it's overwhelming me
his spirit's like the wind
the angel guarding me
"oh, i know, oh, i know"
he's watching over me
"oh, i know, oh, i know"
he's watching over me
we shared dreams like all best friends
blood brothers at the age of ten
"we lived reckless, he paid the price"
but why? why did he have to die?
it still hurts me to this day
am i selfish for feeling this way?
i know he's an angel now
together we'll be someday
i feel it once again
it's overwhelming me
his spirit's like the wind
the angel guarding me
"oh, i know, oh, i know"
he's watching over me
"oh, i know, oh, i know"
he's watching over me
it's a rising wind and your heart is winter
pounding the cold
going far away you're the deepest thinker
walking all alone
building your world of sin
like a judas you're a liar
betraying all the ones you love
you burn your soul with evil fire
and when it all falls down
you wave no flag of weak surrender
hiding deep in your coldest sorrow
you keep playing the pretender
yeah
when the past has turned into a roaring silence
you're lonely as the sun
you are dreaming far to a distant morning
no more on the run
no more
sending deceiving winds
you're a killer for desire
a traitor to the things you love
your victory won't take you higher higher
crushing diamonds to sand
winding scars inside the warrior
bleeding doorways of time
healing wounds of killing war yeah
riding a demon wind
"i am evil, i am fire"
burning the turning wheel
i can tempt you with desire desire
yeah
all right
you're a devil playing god
it's the nature of your heart
oh....
give us this day all that you showed me
"the faith and the glory, till my kingdom comes"
give us this day all that you showed me
"the power and the glory, till my kingdom comes"
give me all the storybook told me
the faith and the glory till my kingdom comes
and they say that in our time
all that's good will fall from grace
even saints would turn their face
in our time
and they told us that in our days
different words said in different ways
have other meanings from he who says
in our time
give us this day all that you showed me
"the power and the glory, till my kingdom comes"
give me all the storybook told me
the faith and the glory till my kingdom comes
and they say that in our time
we would reap from their legacy
we would learn from what they had seen
in our time
and they told us that in our days
we would know what was high on high
we would follow and not defy
in our time
give us this day all that you showed me
"the power and the glory, till my kingdom comes"
give me all the storybook told me
the faith and the glory till my kingdom comes
faithless in faith
we must behold the things we see
give us this day all that you showed me
"the power and the glory, till my kingdom comes"
give me all the storybook told me
the faith and the glory till my kingdom comes
give us this day all that you showed me
"the power and the glory, till my kingdom comes"
give me all the storybook told me
the faith and the glory till my kingdom comes
give us this day all that you showed me
"the power and the glory, till my kingdom comes"
give me all the storybook told me
the faith and the glory till my kingdom comes
i feel the pressure is building in me
"my stomach's sick, it's getting harder to breathe"
"i hear the screaming, i feel the disease"
"there's blood in the air, and there is death on the breeze"
will you come with me?
will you stand with me?
would you follow me?
would you believe with me?
tell me you'll bleed with me
tell me you'll die with me
"come on, come on"
let me hear your war cry
"come on, get up"
let me hear your war cry
"yell it out, do or die"
let me hear your war cry
we wanted peace but you brought this war
we took enough and we can't take any more
"with our fists in the air, we'll burn it all to the ground"
we will tear your fucking empire down
will you come with me?
will you stand with me?
would you follow me?
would you believe with me?
tell me you'll bleed with me
tell me you'll die with me
"come on, come on"
let me hear your war cry
"come on, get up"
let me hear your war cry
"yell it out, do or die"
let me hear your war cry
we wanted peace but you brought this war
we took enough and we can't take anymore
will you come with me?
will you stand with me?
would you follow me?
would you believe with me?
tell me you'll bleed with me
tell me you'll die with me
"come on, come on"
let me hear your war cry
"come on, get up"
let me hear your war cry
"yell it out, do or die"
let me hear your war cry
after all this time
you still couldn't recognise
that your problem lies within
in a vicious circle
can you tell me why
why you've thrown it all away
cos it makes no sense to me
why you wouldn't listen
watching you decline
what were you expecting
i can't save you from yourself
when you don't want saving
it's on your head
don't point the finger point the blame
cos the warning signs were clear
you just wouldn't listen
i know it hurts
tried to help to ease your pain
i know these words
they won't mean anything
i hope it hurts
you've only got yourself to blame
and i can't take this anymore
i'm over it
so over it
breathe in breathe out
i feel it coming round again
breathe in breathe out
don't wanna ride your carousel
breathe in breathe out
don't know how much more i can take
breathe in breathe out
just stop cos i'm about to break
i got my big twin rollin' thumping out a tune
following the headlight coming back to you
i don't need no big jet liner don't need no limousine
all i've got's my pair of wheels satisfaction guaranteed
i'm on my way i'm coming home (*)
i'm on my way i'm coming home
thunder down the highway keeping up the pace
six hundred miles before me until i see your face
gasoline and metal hammer through the night
eating up the freeway makes me feel alright
(repeat *)
polished steel and leather the rumbling of the pair
hear the carburettors sucking in the air
sat around the engine vibrating every bone
keeping it together blasting my way home
walk in my world of war and mass confusion
peace is a word that no one cares of knowing
death is the drug of choice amongst the masses
engines of hell forever burning faster
the shotgun of life
the spread of all the ashes
the wheels of the tank
the souls in which it smashes
"oceans of blood, the shores of all the fallen"
"the hole in the ground, forever always callin'"
lords of destruction
lords of destruction
lords of destruction
lords of destruction

live your life
like your a demigod
you force your weight
on everything and everyone
the bars you live
behind are made of straw
how do you see the world
when you're dead and gone

in the depths of the river
deep in the waves
three rhinemaidens are singing
songs of the brave
an ugly dwarf
greedy with pleasure
"desires the gold,"
tries to steal the treasure
guardians of the holy treasure
no cheat should steal it from the river
gleaming glow in the water's depth
"shines brightly, bravely through the waves"
"rheingold, rheingold"
"rheingold, rheingold"
who denies love
who forfeits its power
can attain the magic
to forge a ring
if you are enarmoured
and longing for love
let's see my handsome
what you look like
guardians of the holy treasure
no cheat should steal it from the river
gleaming glow in the water's depth
"shines brightly, bravely through the waves"
"rheingold, rheingold"
"rheingold, rheingold"
aren't you afraid
brood of the waters
"then conquer the dark,"
and i'll put out your light
i wrench the gold from the rock
forge the ring of revenge
for hell and the devil
i curse my love
guardians of the holy treasure
no cheat should steal it from the river
who from the rheingold will fashion the ring
win the world's wealth and will be king
throne of grief
...in a dying essence
crying beauty
...the fettered aura
forgotten oceans of hope
...betrayed aphony
sullen laughter in unventured paradise
(as one) forever searching
for landscapes serene
amidst the sunset of age
with joyous masquerade...
...the summers died
sermon sung me slow to sleep
faster if i had a choice
with every breath another death
still so in love with your own voice
idle threats to hide regrets
excuses serve to bide the time
"cover tracks, double back"
we summon silence so divine
greeted with a thundering
absence of applause
choke on your own words
lies are venom in your veins
burn from the inside
and never speak my name
"jesus complex, gag reflex"
trigger happy redundancy
"no thrill, no chase, no saving grace"
hypnotic in monotony
loaded with a salt rock shot
you say you're everything you're not
what might have been is all you've got
from here and now you're dead to me
greeted with a thunderous
absence of applause
choke on your own words
lies are venom in your veins
burn from the inside
and never speak my name
nothing will ever erase
or undo your disgrace
a lonely self-embrace
they've long forgotten you
still cling to what it was
a lost and hopeless cause
forever mourning your loss
they've long forgotten you
murdered slowly in minute
increments of time
pissing up a rope
another moment passes by
choke on your own words
lies are venom in your veins
burn from the inside
and never speak my name
"lay me on an anvil, oh lord"
and forge me in a crowbar
let me pry young virgin souls
give 'em strength somehow
"lay me on an anvil, oh lord"
and forge me in a spike
drive me in the wasted hearts
to straighten out their lifes
"let me be your weapon, oh lord"
fight for truth real hard
let me roar with all your force
fight for you and guard
let me be your clearest spirit
hold your temple high
"from the darkest souls, so deep"
to the blackest night
"all your wisdom give me, oh lord"
teach me prayers of steel
give me strength and give me power
give me prayers of steel
free from the sun
in the dark i am none
"though my heart sinks like that one, i am told"
respect nothing!
"not this love, falling further in this motherfucking hole!"
"believe me, believe me, believe me when i say you suck."
"you disgust me when you bring me down,"
but my heart says i will die without you!
respect nothing!
"not this love, falling further in this motherfucking hole!"
"believe me, believe me, believe me when i say you suck."
oh fuck!
"believe me, believe me, please believe me, when i say"
"when i say, when i say, when i . . say"
"fuck you, you think it's all funny! (x3)"
fuck you. like i said.
"fuck you, you think it's all funny! (x3)"
fuck you!
so you've seen i've gotten this far.
please give me some place to hide.
"i'm not trying to go there, so take me away."
life sometimes pisses me off.
it's never a good trip for me
"every time i reach for love, it's taken away."
night! so i play.
give me a sign this is gay.
"give me some patience, so i pray."
it's time to die. is that what i want?
there's nothing wrong wanting to be loved.
is there something wrong with me?
for once in my life i'd like to be really set free.
let me be me.
night! so i play.
give me a sign this is gay.
"give me some guidance, so i pray."
it's time to die. is that what i want?
take me away.
taken away.
take me away.
taken... away.
"something i get, i got to get home"
"run, run, run, run, run, run running home"
where is my home...
...suck my dick...
night! so i play.
give me a sign this is day.
"give me some patience, so i pray."
it's time to die. is that what i want?
night! so i play.
give me a sign this is day.
"give me some guidance, so i pray."
it's time to die. is that what i want?
i was born to give you sound
i came to play and rock this town
welcome to my shadow land
the moon is full and in my hand
burn my flame
burn my flame
gonna burn my flaming fire
burning like a firewind
and a woman you're my sweetest thing
night is young and we can fly
life is short and then we die
burn your flame
burn your flame
burn your flaming fire
come on and burn
when layers of the darkest pain
is weighing down your heart again
hope will rise and make you strong
so come with me and sing my song
burn your flame
burn your flame
burn your flaming fire
oh....
burn your flame
burn your flame
burn your flaming fire
burn your flame
burn your flame
burn your flaming fire
yeah....

gonna burn..... burn.... flame of fire
take it higher.... higher.... higher... higher...higher...
flaming fire

swallow the sun in shadows as they suck out the marrow
the hopeless suffer in the fear of tomorrow
we count the cost to measure it against our loss
the sacrifice of the innocent
separation
the lie from the truth
(the lie from the truth)
our division is our proof
we can't allow this to stand
oppression on demand
led by liars and thieves
as desperation bleeds
they brought us to our knees
so bite the hand that feeds
all their poisonous belief
lead us only to grief
led by liars and thieves
as desperation bleeds
they brought us to our knees
so bite the hand that feeds
altercations spread through violent sanction
mother give your children to the beast
the battles of the poor will soon be called to war
for the wealthy and their war machine
we can't allow this to stand
oppression on demand
led by liars and thieves
as desperation bleeds
they brought us to our knees
so bite the hand that feeds
pushed to the breaking point
awake from your slumber
kick back the shroud that humanity's under
the beckoning call of our so called masters
subjugate us to the brink of disaster
all for what cause?
to perpetuate their endless wars
we can't allow this to stand
oppression on demand
led by liars and thieves
as desperation bleeds
they brought us to our knees
so bite the hand that feeds
all their poisonous belief
lead us only to grief
led by liars and thieves
as desperation bleeds
they brought us to our knees
so bite the hand that feeds
where do we go from here?
we won't go quietly
it must be the end of apathy
we let go of the grip of our sanity
what would you
what would you kill for?
what would you
what would you die for?
what would you
what would you kill for?
what would you
what would you die for?

ships were prepared
weapons and shields
sails were raised
we're heading out to sea!
norway just a bed in the east
our journey had begun
helpfull winds gave us our speed
under a warming sun
heading to the emerald land
a fleet of 50 ships
"a army of 2000 men, led by the king"
"army arising, dark and ferous"
horror across the black roads
as the night rolled in over us
we felt the wrath of the storm
that night i was haunted by dreams
"an omen, of what was to come"
the serpent arose from the sea
ready to strike
with hammer in hand
"the serpent in pain, twisting in furious rage!"
fought for its live
the serpent escaped
thor was in rage
..my dreams began to fade..
[solo of some sort]
awoke of my dreams
sword in my hand
the break of dawn
closing in on irish land
time to attack
grabbed our shields
we came ashore
and saw the waiting horde
the fight was short and deadly intense
the irish fought us well
but as we gained the upperhand
their fighting spirit dwelled
ready to strike
with swords in our hands
the struggle with heart
the irish fell to our wrath
fought for his live
the king escaped
with fury divine
king olav threw his sword

yip-yip-yip-yip-ya-eeeee!
i'm feeling this time
as bad as never before
a bleeding wag is fading away
once you needed me
for spending delight
but below the funny mask
there's a crying face
the way that i smile is the way that i cry
but you'll never realize
my reputation is the one of a fool
now watch how a poet dies
hear his cries
and i dedicate my roses to no one
cause there is no mind to help me to see
the reason we need
a light for the lonesome
and no one to drink
the blood that i bleed
the poet inside - wasn't given a chance
so he had to live apart
and i realized - my best friend am i
and not those parasites
who try to stare into my heart
the way that i feel is the way that i heal
my body and soul and my life
and i know you just think i'm a fool
"now watch how a poet flies, see me rise"
and i dedicate my roses to no one
cause there is no mind to help to see
the reason we need
a light for the lonesome
and no one to drink
the blood that i bleed

if you do try you'll remember
the fine line no one denied
unsharing joy is a pain to release
one by one we all came around and we danced around night and day
one by one we just play our round to leave and drop another way

how many times must we die?
and how many times must we live?
why must the truth be denied?
when will the truth be revealed?
how many times must we learn?
and how many times must we fall?
how many times must we burn
for us to be one and all
you tell me that you're home again
the sun will wake up the sky
with feelings of love
how many times must we care?
and how many times must we win?
when will the earth just stand still
so we can stop murdеring our kin
you tell me that you're homе again
the sun will wake up the sky
why must we be born again to rebel in july
with feelings of love

forgiveness for the witness
"in this callous prognosis (-nosis, -nosis)"

day
into night
into day
into i don't know you anymore
but i stand
where you say
thinking all the time you planned it
you've been gone away too long
leaving us to carry on
though in truth you never tried
just stepped back and watched the slide
paragons of innocence
questioning of your intent
never quite sure what you meant
from the other side
moments on the carousel
must admit we ride it well
and the horses never tell
all throughout the ride
that no one leaves
no one leaves
no one leaves...
alive
time
on my hands
slips away
till i just don't feel it anymore
thinking back
when i can
to the time when it began with
bits of dreams all in a line
and somehow we missed the signs
that it all was never real
and in truth a fatal deal
paragons of innocence
questioning of your intent
never quite sure what you meant
from the other side
moments on the carousel
must admit we ride it well
and the horses never tell
all throughout the ride
no one leaves
no one leaves
no one leaves...

there always comes a time
when you do what you want to do
you know you shouldn't do it
but you do it anyway
and when he had that time
when he knew what he wanted to
he quickly placed his order
though he never thought he'd pay
but the lines turned to lies
and the lies turned to tangles
and you're pale as a cadaver
though you think it doesn't show
so you live with the lies
and the friends that it gathers
but somewhere in your heart you know you
got to let it
got to let it
go
paragons of innocence
questioning of your intent
never quite sure what you meant
from the other side
moments on the carousel
must admit we ride it well
and the horses never tell
all throughout the ride
no one leaves
no one leaves
no one leaves...

then the sailor picked a coat up
that had been laying there
and placed it over the body
and then he said a little prayer
and the ocean brought in on a wave
an old waterlogged wreath
and pushed it up along the sand
till it touched the dead man's feet
and written on that wreath
in letters of gold foil
was the name veronica guerin
but the letters were bent and soiled
the sailor said i see these flowers
that you so kindly gave
are obviously from far away
and from another's grave
and i cannot help but to think
the sailor gently said
that it's unwise in god eyes
to steal flowers from the dead
the ocean said please trust me friend
this gift will cause no pain
and the person to whom they once belonged
would surely say the same
you see this wreath was from the funeral
of a woman who showed no fear
of men who lived in mansions
bought with other people's tears
of men who lived in mansions
bought with bits of others lives
who at night still hugged their children
and brought gifts home to their wives
with money made from heroin
and packets of cocaine
and if a buyer overdosed
they never felt the pain
there were many flowers at her funeral
but none for this boy i fear
so the wind has blown this wreath to me
and i have brought it here
she gave her life to stop the spread
of drugs among her kind
and if we leave these flowers for this boy
i'm sure she wouldn't mind
mr p ? you have that funni little acidy taste in the back of
your throat ?like that ?uh huh you can taste it ? you know what
that is?ut uh fear
fear is an emotion inside us
deeper growing my deaths content
eating away our insides
watching themselves and they step out of skin
so darkness it surrounds the being
memories ressurected of pain
remembered what ??
were reminded then
of a the fear thats inside us and we'll give in today
fear
fuk you
fear
its inside you
why am i here?because you invited me
i cant help for your insecurity
you cant hide it from me cause im inside of you
i took it from you because your a freak show
i mend my soul without reason
patiently concience restrained
my life feels so nice
it seems my darkness disguised entity
shrouded in lifetimes of misery
turned and it swells in my fate
repeated what?
disregarded then
of the visions in my mind reflected mistake
fear
fuk you
fear
its inside you
why am i here?because you invited me
i cant help for your insecurity
you cant hide it from me cause im inside of you
i took it from you because your a freak show

now floating feeling with soul striped from rine
wrapping dead bodies accending
vision restored to my eyes

through defiance why ?
ive just now lifted from dead soiled time

sickness full of weakness in motion

so you think you know what's going on inside her head
you think she wants your money but it's you she wants instead
when you think about the things that she did love to go
it breaks your heart but deep down boy you know it hurts to go
you feel your love so shattering
you feel you want to die
just because someone did take off
telling you a lie
if i were you i'd try again and try to make amends
"she only thinks of you, you know i'm talking as a friend"

there'll be fireworks tonight
everybody's on their knees
admiration for the one
riot in a dead-end street
don't be afraid to hear his voice
tells you lies you wanna hear
[tobias sammet]
you just listen and obey
got the ticket in your hand
a new religion for the mob
for everyone to understand
we're all just clockwork toys tonight
and salvation is drawing near
the snow covered opera tonight
enchanted with dilated eyes
living in a rat race
dying in a rat race
burning in the stream again
why should i dare to break away
living in a rat race
living in a rat race
i got sulfur in my veins
devil watching through my eyes
i got beauty i got brains
and there's no one to defy
i've got the power in my fingers
and the opera in my hands
the onset of winter tonight
the mirror it gives me a smile
living in a rat race
dying in the rat race
burning in the stream again
why should i dare to break away
speeding in the rat race
bleeding in the rat chase
burning in the stream again
why should i dare to break away

a chill grows near you're faced with fear
a darkened day you'll see it clear
your shadows call while you stand tall
watch before me while you fall
"times are changing, rearranging"
where's the answer we've all been looking for
transient dreaming do you believe in
i am the answer to it all
where are you heading to time will tell
to a destiny that fate knows well
so fly away
victim of the silence - wipe the cob - webs from your eyes
"beware the season - the lies, the treason, the pain"
free
the path you strayed from can only lead to dismay
living a timeless tale
behold the truth unveiled
passion and fury fills my heart
knowing my fate
nightmare of fantasy
untrue reality
learning the lesson
as we fight to stay alive
awakened by the thunder - crashing conscience
through your mind
persistent voices - all evils call out your name
tears can break the silence - let your doubts
and fears be heard
you're releasing inned peace from your soul
marching on staff in hand
falling into darkness
carry on through the endless nights calling
living a timeless tale
behold the truth unveiled
passion and fury fills my heart
knowing my fate
nightmare of fantasy
untrue reality
learning the lesson
as we fight to stay alive
crying downs your doubts and fears
they say that time just might heal the wounds of love
it replaces shattered traces of dispair
looking out through all the years
they say that time just might heal the wounds of love
it replaces
love will light the darkness there
bringing some hope into view
it replaces the nameless faces of loneliness that you once
knew
marching on staff in hand
falling into darkness
carry on through the endless nights calling
living a timeless tale
behold the truth unveiled
passion and fury fills my heart
knowing my fate
nightmare of fantasy
untrue reality
learning the lesson
as we fight to stay alive
"it was early in the morning, the sun rises in the sky"
"the place you'd filled is empty, i don't understand why"
"the memories are coming, all slowly on my mind"
"we searched for hope and glory, for the things we couldn't find"
remember the feelings we had all in the past
"they're gone forever, didn't know that it won't last"

we didn't know it wouldn't last
"now that you're gone away, the fireplace's so cold"
"and i don't remember, the stories that have been told"
"and there's no turning back, from the locked doors of our hearts"
"we're stone cold crazy, our love is been apart"
remember the feelings we had all in the past

if you think that you're strong on your own. you best think again.
"i've been there, i've been everywhere so listen my friend"
hear me out let me try to explain i see what you think
"but a chain is never stronger than, its weakest link"
"don't be afraid, altogether we can make a change"
"let's all bind together, to form an unbreakable chain"
you and i belong
together we're strong
only the fight remain
united we are strong
but weak on our own
no one can break this chain
no they cannot break this chain..
"when you're low, feeling weak and confused - don't be alarmed"
"cause i'll be there, to back you up like a log - we're brothers in arms."
"immovable stand together in snow, wind and rain"
the millions of people who've form the unbreakable chain
you and i belong
together we're strong
only the fight remain
united we are strong
but weak on our own
no one can break this chain
no they cannot break this chain..
you and i belong
together we're strong
only the fight remain
united we are strong
but weak on our own
no one can change how we feel
no! no one can break this chain..of steel
i never thought i feel a whim
slipping through my hands
the morning light comes breaking in
as the blacknessfades
no bad reflections can resist
the beginning of an age
a sentence for a crownless king
whose kingdom was a cage
wonder again why
why should we miss the burning of the flame
wait for another sign of rising disorder
till the blade relieves the pain
refrão:
inside your eyes i see a mirror
you mesmerize and there's no error
myself in you to be continued
inside your eyes i see a mirror of me!
i kept a token of my pleas
carved them into stone
but after sailing open seas
two became one
wonder again why
why should we cease the spreading of the stain
wait for another sign of rising disorder
till the light 'cause again
refrão:
inside your eyes i see a mirror...
by igure
you can never escape from your heart
"that inner guide, the voice in the dark"
"stop and listen, just once in a while"
to what it has to say
i remember the day when we met
"your love was true, my life was a mess"
i knew fate was a one way street
but we were meant to be
you're my honest cause
never-ending strive to become better than i am
you're the sweetest sound
the note that explains the symphony
i know i can't hide anymore
"my head is up, my feet on the floor"
and you know i can not lie anymore
when i look into your eyes
fear of failure will all bring us down
to darkened places where dreams go to die
"i pretend to be strong, but i'm weak"
you make my life complete
everything must change
"yet remain the same, but nothing stays forever"
i will take your pain
you are my everlasting flame
my second to one
oh i can not lie
"no, i can not hide when i look into your eyes"
everything i say
everything i do i do for you
i will resurrect
"i have found myself, a knight in shining armour"
when you call my name
i will be your needle for the pain
my second to one
whatever you did to me
"you gotta, you gotta tell me now"
why do we look like strangers?
whatever i did to you
no excuses for this silence
tell me what you're thinking i'll be there for you
"so many stories told, too many useless words"
maybe because it's getting dark inside
this is the last goodbye
these broken dreams have been resigned
here's to our last goodnight
these broken dreams have been resigned
will this set us both free?
"you gotta, you gotta, you gotta"
tell me what you're thinking 'cuz i just don't understand it
whatever i did to you
no excuses for this silence
tell me what you're thinking i'll be listening
"so many stories told, too many useless words"
maybe because it's getting dark inside
this is the last goodbye
these broken dreams have been resigned
here's to our last goodnight
these broken dreams have been resigned
why should i care when it will be alright?
once separate ways we'll feel alive again
"so many stories told, too many useless words"
maybe because it's getting dark inside
this is the last goodbye
these broken dreams have been resigned
here's to our last goodnight
these broken dreams have been resigned
the last goodbye
the last goodbye
the last goodbye
the last goodbye

"this blasphemy, why can't you see?"
their crimes are crystal clear
"deception reigns, you live in chains"
you can no longer feel
in your eyes there is no life
only flesh and blood
"fluoride heads, the walking dead, no fight to stay alive"
"our minds are numb, our body's overcome"
"they beat us down, bread and circus"
"this is our destiny, spawned from their master's creed"
a vicious plot to cull the masses
"they set the trap, you took the bait"
"diseased, they vaccinate"
"create the fear, create the pain"
in chaos they will reign
"spewing lies, a thin disguise"
to mask their true intent
"depopulate, with quiet rage"
patience will feed revenge

"our minds are numb, our body's overcome"

"life, where suffering is the only satisfaction"
sadness of my nights without sleep
anguish to be alone against all
"ritual of blood, where a human being"
gives his life for mine
spills his blood for mine
now i will be them and they will be mine
and we'll be one above your god
blood ritual / purification by the blood
blood ritual / total consecration
my spirit has dived into the infernal storm of evil
my soul is forever tormented
take advantage of this jouvencal fluid
deliver your soul from claws of ignorance
death is the only way to escape the misery of life
death is the only way to reach the supreme power
the caress of he blade on his skin
is waking up my old cruel dreams
look the so coveted liquid going out of his body
look the sacred fluid spilling out of his wounds
let your mind be impregnated

narration:
as i undress you of pagan beauty
who embrace my sex with all your passion and strenght
the lost chimera of virginity will be your true purity
and thy crownleyian erotic laws will rule at last!

that the temptation of samael
is thy erotic law of every man
and i will hesitate not to enter hell
where this dioniosiac fortune had ever dwell!

these cunted beings to their end
until the sunset of their resistance fall
behind the flowers which adorn their head
i lust with thee. everlasting seekers of animality.

these hard lines and sunken cheeks are text book reasons

"you know it's bad, some may say sad, a hangover is"
"inspiration. like a junkie i hurt for it. a bad trip, the"

if i ever think of you
the same moon shines
the same wind blows for both of us
and time is but a paper moon
be not gone
though i'm gone it's as though
i hold the flower that touches you
a new life grows
the blossom knows there's no one else
could warm my heart as much as you
be not gone

my brain has been changed
you hear my screams
my blood flows painfully
you hear my plea
i am in my tomb
with hands tied
i am stuck in the rot
the fever is the brain wash
the surgery is near the end
there are no memories
is like a shadow produced by the mind
do you hear my plea ? no !
"life knows only life, force know the truth"
only my voice !
only my silence !
the illusion is full of pain
my brain is suffering !
my brain was stolen !
my brain is washed !
my brain was frozen !
the ivory is cold. where is my desire
"in a cage of gold, not a trace of fire"
ice cold as ice. i'm heading for tomorrow
i am tired of waiting. i'll beg and steal and borrow
life is too short to be wasted
so why do i sit around
dance on the edge of a razor
get off the ground and i'll never return
walk on fighting
don't look ever back
walk on fighting
don't you look back to your cries
the phone it waits in silence. no message left by you
there is no use in crying. i know i've been a fool
now it is too late. no words left to say
"i gotta call it fate, forget and look away"
life is to short to be wasted
so why do i sit around
dance on the edge of a razor
get off the ground and i'll never return
walk on fighting
don't look ever back
walk on fighting
don't you look back to your cries
walk on fighting...
contempt for christianity knows no limit
the so - called chosen people can fuck off
brutal treatment - is now unleashed - sbsr
annihilation - of the christians - sbsr
the man who has never been in the clutches
of a crushing riper
can never know what its poison is - its poison is
sirens roars - cruelity impress - sbsr
bullshit culture - leat them into ruin sbsr
every crossing between two breeds spreads disease
holiness responsible for lies and weakness
we rape your will - dominate with shudder - sbsr
pillage the prophets - soon nothing will remain - sbsr
[september '91]
the fire in the sky is extinguished
blue waters no longer cry
the dancing of trees has stopped
the stream of freshness from cold winds
exists no longer
the rain has stopped to drip
from the sky
still dripping exists
from the veins of a nearly dead boy
once there was hatred
once there was cold
now
there is only
a dark stone tomb
with an altar
an altar which
serves as a bed
a bed of eternal sleep
the dreams of the human in sleep
are dreams of relief
a gate out of hell
into the void of death
yet undisturbed
the human sleep
and one day
will the grave be unlocked
and the soul
must return to his world
but this time as
a lost forgotten sad spirit
doomed
to haunt
endlessly
line up all of you and turn in your eyes
you just won't need them anymore
and your mind is ours to do with what we please
everything you own and everything you need
sacrifice you leaders; like it or not
or else you're going down with ship; death on the rocks
blind follow; blind lead
"all our hopes and dreams, washed out to sea"
all your money's ours to bankroll corrupt wars
you can't see what you're fighting for
trust your leaders as they send you out to die
the true face of evil can't be seen without eyes
at the start of time; many centuries ago
came the spawning of christ and the antichrist
and darkness fell upon our people
"and the children, they were born faceless"
without eyes they could not see
born unto themselves; they lived and they died
in the millennium of the blind
in the beginning it was only science
they started to analyze the psyche of children
how they act in fear
this fear that all children have to share
in all the times
in all the cultures
an irrational fear
the fear in darkness
angst
seven innocent children
in the circle of ouruboros
their throats cut from loving hands
"the sign, the old occult symbol"
back to origin and chaos
they all must die
darkness from loving hands
the evil i purify
annually
the ouroboros
darkness
purify
save them from ouroboros
their throats cut from loving hands
"the sign, the old occult symbol"
back to origin and chaos
they all must die
in all the times
in all the cultures
the new level
the new level
living dead vampiress
trying to taunt me back to the grave
my black and macabre past
summoning me forever a slave
black sun arising
howling moon it screams
as spider's web she's weaving again
hallucinations sucking me in
resisting the ghost
my former life host
resisting the ghost
echoed celebrations
haunt loves hollow room
motivation mortally trapped
in regrets obsessive tomb
a stake she's thrusting
into my dying heart
power igniting the past
awakes me from this coffin at last
resisting the ghost
resisting the ghost
she was the one i love most
i've rejected the ghost
my beautiful liar
why are you crying
on your knees
you've crucified yourself
and now denial is rising
why
so tell me
so tell me how did you
lose yourself at sea
drifting within
so tell me why did you
cast yourself away
it's such a sweet addiction
you should celebrate
my beautiful liar
you are drowning
in your fear
you're cutting into me
you think if i bleed
it can save you
why
so tell me
so tell me how did you
lose yourself at sea
drifting within this
so tell me why did you
cast yourself away
it's such a sweet addiction
you should celebrate
and you know if i could
i'd take your pain
but will you turn and
face your disease
"don't forget me now, laughing through the tears"
"for somewhere, somehow, life becomes the years"
"you speak to millions, but you're talking to no one"
home is the place that you can't walk away from
you seek our opinions but listen to no one
you throw up your hands and tell me that it's all done
"we intend to rise through motion, speak through silence"
and fight 'til the ocean
no more glimmering hopes or commotions
our dedications to each other in devotion
"no pretending now,"
your heart is open and you reappear
"for somewhere, somehow, you drop the fall"
and you ran with fear
"you speak to millions, but talk to no one"
home is the place you can't walk away from
you seek opinions but listen to no one
you throw up your hands and tell me that it's all done
"we intend to rise through motion, speak through silence"
and fight 'til the ocean
no more glimmering hopes or commotions
our dedications to each other in devotion
we intend to speak through peace
cross the ocean and wake up in the east
make jerusalem home for all creeds
unsheathe your swords and take the eagle's peace
"i want you, i need you"
i pray that god absolves you
can't live this life without you
i've cleared the coffin for two
"i want you, i need you"
i pray that god absolves you
can't live this life without you
i've cleared the coffin for two
"come, today is another day"
"come, your hairs are no longer grey"
"come, we're clearing the runway"
there's no turning back from the path for the chosen ones
"we intend to rise through motion, speak through silence"
and fight 'til the ocean
no more glimmering hopes or commotions
our dedications to each other in devotion
we intend to scream through peace
cross the ocean and wake up in the east
make jerusalem home for all the creeds
unsheathe your swords and take the eagle's peace
have you ever thought about your soul - can it be saved?
or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in your grave
is god just a thought within your head or is he a part of you?
is christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school?
when you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?
would you like to see the pope on the end of a rope - do you think he's a fool?
"well i have seen the truth, yes i've seen the light and i've changed my ways"
and i'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days
could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
if they knew you believe in god above?
they should realize before they criticize
that god is the only way to love
is your mind so small that you have to fall
in with the pack wherever they run
will you still sneer when death is near
and say they may as well worship the sun?
i think it was true it was people like you that crucified christ
i think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced
"will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?"
"you had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve"
perhaps you'll think before you say that god is dead and gone
"open your eyes, just realize that he's the one"
the only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate
or will you still jeer at all you hear? yes! i think it's too late.
only dead have seen the end of war
knowing that i feel a bit better
when i do remember what's happened before...
"oh, well"
moving on to the heart of the matter
"father always told me 'bout men and mice,"
bein' not afraid to take chances
"well, he said enough 'coz by the time he got iced"
i was on my way – circumstances led me out into the open...
"boy, reality bites."
doesn't matter what you do - another crook gets rich
doesn't mean a thing what's your calling
"living by your heart and whining ""life is such a bitch""?"
"anyway you go, you're falling to the bottom of the food chain"
let me show you the way
refrão:
when the moon comes up and the sun goes down
i can change the whole world - feeling stronger
from the dead of night to the morning light
getting ready to challenge my faith
"when you're feeling weak and your life seems tough,"
you can't wait for a break any longer
"who can stone you cold, who can whip you down"
if you'll steal a lil' kiss from your faith
do i live as i live or i do as i do?
don't you forget who told you :
"""when life has no value – death has its price"""
... just something i saw in my father's eyes
refrão
sloth is the enemy of greatness
reflection a scalpel to my mind.
we strive as you leisurely criticize
a free ride until you find that you've dug your own grave
lie by lie.
just a running mouth
poison words you throw about
drag you to your end
the number six
leviathan.
you've dug your own grave with your spite
you've dug your own grave lie by lie
a cancer that needs to be cut out
sweet slander the razor to your throat
trim the fat
a loose end to be tied up and cast aside
left to find that you've dug your own grave.
a relentless imposition by a self-fulfilling travesty
from one who is just rotting there
in slut's wool and zero history
aesthetic condemning
erratic condescending
an empty barrel always makes the most noise
and i begin to feel my hands around your throat.
you've dug your own grave with your spite
you've dug your own grave lie by lie
a running mouth and poison words will be your end
the number six
leviathan.
all those beautiful people
i want to have them all
all those porcelain models
if only i could make them fall
be my heart a well of love
flowing free so far above
a wintry eve
once upon a tale
an ugly duckling
of a sparrows carol
dreaming the stars
solo
be my heart a well of love
flowing free so far above
in my world
love is for poets
never the famous balcony scene
just a dying faith
on the heaven's gate
solo
crystal pond awaits the lorn
tonight another morn for the lonely one is born
"damnation,religion"
"salvation,fire"
and steel
i have seen the fire
of a thousand suns pass by
while blasphemers spread their gospel
bearing false witness
now we rise
all ye children of the wild
fists like hammers fill the air
vast legions all immortal
smash the stilness everywhere
"holy,holy war"
holy
"we are fighting,figthing a holy war"
holy war
see us fly on winds of doom
holy war
baptized in fire and steel
holy war
for the end we bring is soon
holy war
now we face the storm
a holy war
brothers of metal know no masters
metal's our religion
take it to the grave
rulers of the earth
our dawn of glory
"all reborn,we live again."
"hold true,ye sacred army"
our last battle is at hand
sweep these dogs from our kingdom
"bless this ground, our holy land."
"holy,holy war"
holy
"we are fighting,figthing a holy war"
holy war
see us fly on winds of doom
holy war
baptized in fire and steel
holy war
for the end we bring is soon
holy war
now we face the storm
a holy war

and i'm still living that moment...
"i hear in the symphony of winds,"
the whispering of her voice
echoing beautifully in my thoughts;
the supreme melody of enchantment
embracing me in pure ecstasy.
i'm living in my fantasy
bringing my winter with graciousness
guiding myself unto cloudy skies
she casts the lies in my head.
drinking my wine with relish
she's using all her malice
she holds my hands in glee
leaving me in misery
"immortal beauty, endless cruelty"
am i worthy of her passion?
or even to touch her body when the night falls?
freeze with the ocean of heartless emotions
deal with the fact that she's not there
grasp for an answer to all simple chapters
read with the insight of unsecurity
fate becomes desolated
observing all the suffering
that she brought me
i'll embrace her soul
not like before
i'll be coming with my blackened heart.
into the emptiness of darkness
"a great lament has been heard,"
flesh and soul were united
in the scars of a cursed past
through never-ending fevered nightmares
my tears shall bring grave sickness to mankind
"cause, this is the creed that brings effect"
that of which of mankind's besieged
by our plans devised infect
kings and empires rise and fall
by the rose and our decree
of the elder's prophecy
that rids us of the human threat
and frees the hand of destiny
fate by our dominion
in their sovereign states
fall like dominos
framing mankind's fate
kill! assassinate the ones that lead
by their example we deceive
with religions we create
"martyrs, saviors and their slaves"
to a sad sadistic need
to crucify a puppet king
of a selfish vile race
that is filled to the core by greed
fate by our dominion
in their sovereign states
fall like dominos
framing mankind's fate
divide!! mankind!!
destroy!! their kind!!!
fear will make us free
cast doubt through history
divide!!!
fate by our dominion
in their sovereign states
fall like dominos
framing mankind's fate
thunder shattered the dawn
"raging with fury, the king has come"
the power of terror will reign
there is no mercy in pleading
"in for the kill, no quarter be shown"
live for the thrill of battle alone
blessed by the will to die for the throne
in for the kill
in for the kill
freedom is taken by storm
the blood on his hands is still running warm
the power of terror will reign
there is no mercy in pleading
"in for the kill, no quarter be shown"
live for the thrill of battle alone
blessed by the will to die for the throne
in for the kill
for the kill
thunder shattered the dawn
"raging with fury, the king has come"
death and destruction riding the storm
blood on his hands still running warm
in for the kill
the king has come
another faceless man in grey set house on fire -
and he stayed 'til every single flat was burning
this guy just launched his own attack -
shot older woman in the back
"he's not a pro, but he is learning"
this terror lives on our fears - and it's growing
playing the game of fear -
wild on the streets letting blindfolded steer
playing the game of fear -
run for your life 'coz your last day is near... just waiting
somebody's in the mood for war
which non of us have seen before
the rules are simple - random killing
"without a clue, without the cause -"
"we live in freedom, and because"
that simple fact just hurt their feelings
"face this human waste, change the pace - 'coz it's growingbr> playing the game of fear -"
wild on the streets letting blindfolded steer
playing the game of fear - sneaking behind like a snake.
disappear! playing the game of fear -
"feeding the war, and you're making it clear"
playing the game of fear -
run for your life 'coz your last day is near

let it be known that this has gone on for far too long
and we can take no more
through the years i have come to realize
that the truth is often right before our eyes
we are aware and know the hearts of fellow man
so let us act as such and help our brothers to stand
and now we offer this small bit of wisdom
the heart it came from will set you on your way
"ignorance will crush us, destroy all that we have"
"so let us rejoice that, the powers in our hands"
to shape us and make us keepers of fellow man
so let us rejoice that the powers in our hands
let us find strength in our neighbors hands
we are not creatures made to be alone
and when we act as such we help our brothers to stand
and now we offer this small bit of wisdom
the heart it came from will set you on your way
and now i ask you to take heed of my words
to move with purpose to a future worth living
"ignorance will crush us, destroy all that we have"
"so let us rejoice that, the powers in our"
to shape us and make us keepers of fellow man
so let us rejoice that the powers in our hands
it is time to address the fact that alone
none of us can survive
i have you here in my dreams at night
you were holding my hands
then i awake and you're not mine
now it's time to rise
i want you to turn cold ice in my soul
got to freeze this yearning inside
when you're inflicted by the passion of love
desire and yearning the deeper they burn
you were.. now it's too late... you were...
now you're gone...
it's too late...
i was wrong...
it's my fate...
i have you here in my dreams at night

now you're gone...

i was wrong...
it's my fate...
i think of you and i see me
i'm the one i thought i've never be
"i feel dirty, no purity"
desire and yearning in your heart
no mercy for you
no mercy for me
when you're inflicted by the passion of love
desire and yearning the deeper they burn
you were.. now it's too late... you were...
now you're gone...

hello me... meet the real me
and my misfits way of life
a dark black past is my
most valued possession
"hindsight is always 20-20,"
but looking back it's still a bit fuzzy
speak of mutually assured destruction?
nice story... tell it to reader's digest!
feeling paranoid
true enemy or false friend?
"anxiety's attacking me, and"
my air is getting thin
i'm in trouble for the things
i haven't got to yet
"i'm chomping at the bit, and my"
"palms are getting wet, sweating bullets."
hello me... it's me again
"you can subdue, but never tame me"
it gives me a migraine headache
thinking down to your level
"yea, just keep on thinking it's my fault"
and stay an inch or two outta kicking distance
mankind has got to know
his limitations
feeling claustrophobic
like the walls are closing in
blood stains on my hands and
i don't know where i've been
i'm in trouble for the things
i haven't got to yet
i'm sharpening the axe and my
"palms are getting wet, sweating bullets"
"well, me... it's nice talking to myself"
a credit to dementia
some day you too will know my pain
and smile its blacktooth grin
if the war inside my head
won't take a day off i'll be dead
my icy fingers claw your back
here i come again
feeling paranoid
true enemy or false friend?
anxiety's attacking me
and my air is getting thin
feeling claustrophobic
like the walls are closing in
blood stains on my hands and
i don't know where i've been
once you committed me
now you've acquitted me
claiming validity
for your stupidity
i'm chomping at the bit
i'm sharpening the axe
"here i come again, whoa!"
sweating bullets
run!
rise!
burn me reducing the stigma
born to live in this house of shame
while i dig the grave on my path
to find faith
you weren't there while i was dying
you're the reason i'm feeling so deranged
i will stay here and haunt you forever
why always staring into the light?
if i don't hide inside the darkness
you'll be compromised
but sometimes
you will fly with me again
"without falling, without falling"
rise!
read my words!
run!
mark my words!
i'm bedridden here locked outside of my faith
incurable captured by time
you're the reason i'm feeling so deranged
i will stay here and haunt you forever
why always staring into the light?
if i don't hide inside the darkness
you'll be compromised
but sometimes
you will fly with me again
"without falling, without falling"
i told you to leave me alone
i told you to leave me alone
i told you to leave me alone
i told you to leave me alone!
take my soul!
sometimes
you will find me there again
"without mourning, without mourning"
sometimes
you will fly with me again
"without falling, without falling"
rise!
read my words!
run!
mark my words!
lost the pieces of my mind
my soul keeps searching for a better place in time
where should i go?
what should i be?
seems like the things in life are lost that set me free
"blind man, blue man"
"sad man, used man"
"blind man, blue man"
empty man
i've joined a group of walking dead
"hard to know what's bad, what's good, what's in my head"
living life in a matchbox
peeking out it seems the spinning never stops
"blind man, blue man"
"sad man, used man"
"blind man, blue man"
empty man
"blind man, blue man"
"sad man, used man"
"blind man, blue man"
empty man
broken pieces cast in gray
hallow shell of human clay
a heart that's sewing shut my eyes
can't see the love that shines before me
i'm such a blind man
i'm more than blue man
a silly sad man
i'm all but used up man
old reflections of good times
stare at me blankly like a wristwatch that won't wind
locked in a mirror with no key
it's hard to see that smiling creature once was me
"blind man, blue man"
"sad man, used man"
"blind man, blue man"
empty man
"blind man, blue man"
"sad man, used man"
"blind man, blue man"
empty man
empty man
empty man
my soul / feels empty
i'm drowning in my tears
it's pain / i'm learning
my heart / is aching
got poison in my veins
in hell / i'm burning
save my life
save my life
let these tears be our secret
you and i
you and i
once we were so close
save my life
it's all / or nothing
i'm asking you to give
let live / or die
everything / is better
than this silent lie
say that / it's no lie!
save my life
save my life
let these tears be our secret
you and i
you and i
once we were so close
save my life
i need you to save my life
save my life
save my life
let these tears be our secret
you and i
you and i
once we were so close
save my life
save my life
save my life
let me feel you breathing
in your hands
in your hands
is the heart of mine
save my life
lost in the pages of an old tome
lies a forgotten promise
"over the ages,"
it turned into stone
nothing can be forever gone...
the moon will keep the oceans moving
but it never sees the sun
weight of heaven handed over
from fathers to sons-as it´s been always done
flowers don´t fade away simply to die
keep turning round in the circle of life
the sun will dry a thousand rivers
till it ever rains again
by the flowing of the seasons the beginning and the end
-as it was ever meant -
as the world keeps turning round
like it lasts forever
and the tides keep moving on
"forever is too long,"
forever is too long
"i know-that i´m losing my soul,"
"i know-that it´s out of control,"
"i know that i cannot let go,"
i know-what is meant to be!
as the world keeps turning round
like it lasts forever
and the tides keep moving on
"forever is too long,forever is too long"
"""never for the damned"" (5:02)"
never saw the light against the world
never seen a truth in all i've heard
never for the damned
"flawless, life just revealed as a chain of events you delay"
"lawless, life the ordeal with no thread of intention retained"
heaven or denial again i learn
heresy the truce for all who burn
never for the damned
"distress, throw out the dreams which you cry in defence of and pray"
"only, rise if the reason determines you cling for the sake"
never there again...
never lose pretend...
ascend and fall for me...
we are foe
self esteems low
set me free...
"i am the author, dream up your pain"
"drink as did bacchus, rebel just like cain"
"lord of the city, i shall remain"
all pandemonium i shall reign
set in my fortress up on my hill
drinking the wine till i've had my fill
"building up high, my castle walls"
"oh, to veil my splendid fall"
i present you this crown of worms
surrounding myself with misery
drawn curtains heavy of my history
"exquisite i am, perfect unity"
on my left hand is false majesty
"i feign affection, refute the true story"
"dispute with creation, the lie is my glory"
"i care for no one, my gospel is death"
"for me the light's gone, only darkness is left"
i present you this crown of worms
"as black in deed, as cold as stone"
"a commandment of one, as proud as gold"
"as neglected in spirit, as time is old"
"as legion is numbers, as legend is told"
i am alone with agony of truth
my power of will
my judgment and chain
my end is knowledge and conscience of guilt
my final confusion hidden from me till i'm done
"voice is a weapon, bombs are away"
"mind's a trigger, fire away"
"world's in a crossfire, of panic and fear"
"the war is upon us, i say it starts here"
we will take control
of this abortion called society
i despise the mediocrity
inject the system with something new
a social terror to lead the few
why call it the land of the free?
political banter - if you ask me
"diffusing a problem, the question is how"
"with imminent conflict, the answer starts now"
i can say
we're not the answer to the world's decay
here to say
we're just the ones who won't go away
we will take control
of this disaster called society
i despise the mediocrity
so now i'm going to introduce
a social terror that's on the loose
[solo: king]
i am the propaganda war machine
the face of fury and obscenity
so when society has gone astray
i'll be the one to pave the way
they'll never fuck with my reality
'cause this right here to me is unity
when all is done we'll have always shown
a domination that was never known
we will take control
of this abortion called society
i despise the mediocrity
we are the torch that lights the fuse
a social terror with nothing to lose
even in my darkest times
overcome with worry
find the comfort in the storm
no reason to be sorry
look inside for a place to hide
all around the faithless wait full of expectations
they will never see the beauty in the imperfections
the more i show
the less they know
out of reach
underneath
learned to breath
underneath
something inside of me
invisible turning the fragile
unbreakable
but they cannot take away
they cannot take away
what i believe
you cannot take away
cannot take away
what's underneath
every little cut runs deep
masked in my tomorrow
bringing wisdom that i need for all the time i borrow
my other side is left behind
out of reach
underneath
learned to breath
underneath
something inside of me
invisible turning the fragile
unbreakable
but they cannot take away
they cannot take away
what i believe
you cannot take away
cannot take away
what's underneath

"here we stand,"
i know it's always been our home
we're awakened from our prison
"a new day, it's finally here,"
we walk the streets without fear
our humanity has risen
digging out those microchips
that kept us dormant to resist
singing songs of our triumph
to maintain our current state
we must try to elevate
our minds and our future
we lived through their lies
no we'll always keep
a conscious mind
and we hold our heads up high
we will never let our spirit die
"the brave new world,"
you know it's always been a lie
pushed with their manipulation
cast away the unseen chains
they shackle you a slave
take control of your existence
flushing out their poison ways
live to fight another day
the time is now to start living
we've taken back our dignity
we are alive and we are free
a revolution of our spirit
we lived through their lies
no we'll always keep
a conscious mind
and we hold our heads up high
we will never let our spirit die
time is on our side
we have prevailed
humanity's ultimate struggle
hearts and minds
are joined in victory

we can build a brand new future

we live our lives without fear
our humanity has risen
the task at hand to educate
so we don't make the same mistake
never take the road to serfdom

dystopia we did escape
never to repeat the nightmare
we lived through their lies
no we'll always keep

just one time before
it will come again
little voice inside
inside my head
tell me when it's time to turn around again
all appears to fade away
i can see your face
and i feel the pain
and i feel the shame that i have let you down again
people everywhere
not a drop to drink
not a dare to think about the damage i have done
try to give up what weighs
what weighs you down
the only control you have
is all your own
do i fit the pieces
together again
or do i leave them lying on the floor?

not a drop to drink

is the hardest thing i've done
asking where did i go wrong?
i wonder what all of this makes
does fortune favor the bold?

winds of change blow over us
winds of change blow over us
winds of change don't change us.......at all
in a world of desperation
women struggle to be free
their last truth and inspiration
to break the chains of you and me
look around and have your visions
of what is and what could be
letting loose imagination
make your own reality
winds of change blow over us
winds of change blow over us
winds of change blow over us
winds of change don't change us.......at all
we all stand together
all of us as one
you hold on to somebody

you fierce into the rising sun

"father tell me, you still there, or not?"
"i seem like a clown, i know"
i didn’t ever know if i could trust in you
and now i’m looking for you
but the world is unfold to dark
"and future stops, hidden by a mysterious veil"
everybody looks so unreal
all those faces with no smiles
only hopes rolling deeper in the night
and nothing can give me enough just to make me feel
like a hunger that’s burning deep inside
i thought i got everything
but everything went away from me
maybe we feel we own something
maybe… and new emotions come
"only when they come from nothing, out of rules"
maybe we feel we lost something
and maybe… how can we feel the joy
of a rising sun announcing the new day?
"it’s so hard to say i’m sorry, sometimes,"
still don’t see the reason why
"but this apathy is running on, you see"
where have i lead this world?
now tell me… where has all of my science gone?
we’re returning to the golden age but the honey is bad
why don’t we invest our time just to get to eternity?
our needs and promises we’ve lost…
and nothing can give me enough just to make me feel
like a hunger that’s burning deep inside
i thought i got everything
but everything went away from me
maybe we feel we own something
maybe… and new emotions come
"only when they come from nothing, out of rules"
maybe we feel we lost something
and maybe… how can we feel the joy
of a rising sun announcing the new day?
maybe we feel we own something
maybe… and new emotions come
"only when they come from nothing, out of rules"
maybe we feel we lost something
"oh, maybe… how can we feel the joy"
of a rising sun announcing the new day?
maybe we feel we own something
and maybe… and a new emotion comes
"only when it comes from nothing, out of rules"
maybe we feel we lost something…
and nothing can give me enough just to make me feel
like a hunger that’s burning deep inside
i thought i got everything
but everything went away from me
by rfs
becoming weary of your lies
you disguise the truth belies
only fooling yourself
pretend to bite the hand that feeds
but you won't discard your security
the transparancy of your fantasy
i'm waiting for a train
to take away the pain and ease my mind
i hear the tracks squeal
it makes me want to scream and let the world know how i feel
"one way journey, no need for a seat"
"i'm beat, i won't be coming back"
"and what i'm learning, this life will be turning"
around at the end of the tracks
"freedom, the life of a drifter"
"who know, if i'll ever find home"
when its time to go i'm already there
"i'm never scared, i'm living one day at a time"
freedom is my crime
another hazy night
"nothing is in sight, no hope in the air"
would i leave behind
"all that's on my mind, would i forget, would i dare"
"one way journey, no need for a seat"
"i'm beat, i won't be coming back"
"and what i'm learning, this life will be turning"
around at the end of the tracks
"freedom, the life of a drifter"
"who know, if i'll ever find home"
when its time to go i'm already there
"i'm never scared, i'm living one day at a time"
the sun ain't burning the skies aren't blue
for me it's a sign to move on
and what i hear has made it so clear
i'm heading towards the new dawn
"freedom, the life of a drifter"
"who know, if i'll ever find home"
when its time to go i'm already there
"i'm never scared, i'm living one day at a time"
i can't show pain
long for days
when i am free to feel
don't want to lose everything
just want to feel again
my heart would burst for you
if that would make things right
i don't feel anything
outside the pain you bring
starting over doesn't look so bad this time
i am not empty inside
"though i long, to make this right"
emotions still touch me
still i can't feel a thing
like ghosts they melt into the fog
and leave me cold
only shadows and impressions
are left for me to hold
my heart would burst for you if that would make you whole
i am not empty inside
"still i long, to make this right"
i am not empty inside
"though i long, to make this right"
i am not empty inside
"still i long, to make this right"
i am not empty inside
(empty inside)
"though i long, to make this right"
(make this right)
don't want to lose everything
just want to feel again
my heart would burst for you
if that would make things right
i don't feel anything
outside the pain you bring
starting over doesn't look so bad this time
i am not empty
i am not empty
i am not empty
i am not empty
"tonight, she takes her time"
"slowly, she lays down"
"open her legs, as we spread our wings"
across the timeless space
she will remind the queen of the world
'till her newborn child grows
giving her understanding
"of her reason, reason to be"
she dances with herself
"""unconscious of her beauty"
no one told her
never heard about purity
"no one touched her"""
and i sing this song
for all the dead promises
all the fallen souls
and those who laughed at them
and i sing this song
to all the bleeding hearts
my ode to the night
here it comes straight down the barrel
thru the bone right to the metal
i can feel it pierce my very soul
"who is the slave, who is the master"
you'll never get what you're after
it'll steal your will and leave a burning hole
"who is the man in the mirror, bringer of pain"
tempting and terror
sometimes he'll rock you to the core
"wanting to do just the right thing, all alone"
constantly fighting
"this is it, my internal war"
"there's two worlds colliding, right inside of me"
"two worlds colliding, i'm my own worst enemy"
"there's two worlds colliding, and i'm watching helplessly"
"how two worlds colliding, collide inside of me"
"same song, another rendition"
"round the bend, head on collision"
"give and take, endless compromise"
run away from the temptation
straight ahead into frustration
like a shot right between the eyes
"there's two worlds colliding, right inside of me"
"two worlds colliding, i'm my own worst enemy"
"there's two worlds colliding, and i'm watching helplessly"
"how two worlds colliding, collide inside of me"
"am i going crazy, have i lost my mind"
"insanity enslaves me, i'm starting to unwind"
"two worlds colliding, right inside of me"
"two worlds colliding, i'm my own worst enemy"
"two worlds colliding, collide inside of me"
"it's two worlds colliding, and i'm watching helplessly"
"two worlds coulliding, collide inside of me"

avoiding the look in my disfigured face
i'm just waiting for the moon to come and set me free
and i'm just waiting for moonlight and then my eyes you can see
i'm just waiting for the moon to come and set me free
because the moonlight can release me from my misery
hide my face in the day
tonight i'll set myself free
i'm addicted too moonlight

a pleasure for me and my distorted soul
i'm just waiting for the moon to come and set me free

i'm just waiting for the moon to come and set me free
because the moonlight can release me from my misery
hid my face in the day
tonight i'll set myself free
"run with the wind, feel the wet in the air"
"oh, how i'm longing for it"
a pleasure for me and my distorted soul
i feel like the cat walkin' on a wall
chain him jail him judge and crucify find him bind him nail him crucify
raised boy the virgin is pure and good father to the race
sinful in sodom with cold blind luster praying to the golden calf
walking the land with twelve good men that follow talking the hand of one whose blind
curing the lame causing mutes to speak miracles prevail to the open mind
chain him jail him judge and crucify find him bind him nail him crucify
saved for forty days and nights he roamed the desert sand
no food to nourish only faith temptations close at hand
evil abounds in every footstep that he takes in the sand he must stay true
all this in vain because he'll die for sure saving the frame of all that's good
forgive them father for they know not what they do

there in the dark
there's a child and she's waiting
lost in the maze of a fait accompli
is it a crime to be just hesitating
while we're pretending that we never see
on a tv mounted on the wall
from this distance i can see it all
and i've been out here watching you
watching you fall
is there a trick to the art of not feeling
safe in our world while another's child bleeds
praying that god won't demand a redealing
of cards we have held and pretend you don't need
don't need
on a tv mounted on the wall
from this distance
i can see it all
and i've been out here
watching you
watching you fall
better not think about it
anytime we'll start to doubt it
christ has risen
keep him hidden
god forbid he sees
it's not that we lack the vision
only just a quick desision
"who will blame us, rules restrain us"
it's all in history
so close my eyes and pretend i am sleeping
avoiding the chance that you'll visit my dreams
on a tv mounted on the wall
from this distance i can see it all
"and i've been out here watching you watching you,"
"watching you, watching you watching you fall yeah yeah"

there's a sickness that keeps reaching out
grabbing a hold of the world no control
"reputation, reputation"
mortality of the men
"cowards they always leave filth in there tracks that won't wash, wash away"
"fear is the motive in the things that do, that they do"
their world seems so godless
their world seems so godless
all out to war
the way to be stronger
all out to war
by force we will conquer
the fraud the elections denying the freedom of choice from the people
repeating the errors inventing excuses to profit from conflicts

something flew out from the clouds
and it smoked and smoked and sparked in silver blue
a few humans disappeared
chaos reigns and there is fear
there is hate - in the eye of an eagle
there is lust - in the eye of an eagle
lightning struck on the wings of chrome
"headlights radiated, searching for more"
as quick as they appeared they crushed away
laser shots out of the hemisphere
eye - witness told us of steel eagles
"we will never know, or should we believe it"
there is hate - in the eye of an eagle
there is lust - in the eye of an eagle
a few humans disappeared

wicked sons of heaven’s loss
raise your own inverted cross
"kings of earth, iron first"
serve the sacred you dismissed
stand before your final day
choke on every line you pray
raise your glass to death
not one second left

"stand beside me, storm the gates of hell"

"stand beside me, storm the gates of hell"

stand to face what you’ve outrun

bound to all you took in vain

or watch your blessed temple burn
raise your glass to death
not one second left
hell hath no fury at all
give the devil your little finger
he'll take your whole hand
wanna stay in bed
got a heavy head
a sledge-hammer in my skull
but i'm scared i'd wind up dead
if life should get too dull
"well, maybe there ain't no divine plan"
and things just happen cause they can
just don't paint devils on the wall
ain't nothing cool about death at all
love and light are heaven-sent
we really ain't all that hellbent
on darkness our style
we'd rather make you smile
killing them with kindness all the while
why on earth you wanna blame god
when things don't go your way?
it's just the evil that men do down here everyday
take responsibility for your actions and your liberty
can't neglect cause and effect with your apathy
the second coming came and went
third-time lucky heaven-sent
it ain't no shuck n' jive
you control your life
you don't need the trouble or the strife
if there's a god we know him well
if there's a devil we can tell
there ain't no punishment in hell
sin is only man's invention
it ain't no divine intervention
you make your own heaven and your hell
if there's a god we know him well
if there's a devil we can tell
there ain't no punishment in hell
you don't get saved by the bell
if there's a god we know him well
if there's a devil we can tell
there ain't no punishment in hell
sin is only man's invention
it ain't no divine intervention
you make your own heaven and your hell
what do they see when they look at me
who are they to judge me if they never spoke with me
"never looked without laughing, never tried to see, see me"
"i can't believe that it is only me, the person to hate,"

i can't believe how they can be so mean;
if they could feel the brutal stings of their words

sometimes the morning seems
dark as the unknown
night seems without ending as a road
to forgotten land
thousand years and thousand dreams are gone
hidden within tears they're still alone

to subdue the caim before the storm

i was listening to the music on the radio (*)
i had a feeling that something's not right
"the music was loud, we could still hear the crowd"
from the gig that we played that night
we pulled into a motorway restaurant
"stopped awhile, fooled around"
but i still had a feeling that something's not right
'cause we're standing in a whole in the ground
"stop, get out (**)"
we are the strong arm of the law
"stop, get out"
we are the strong arm of the law
into the night came a blue flashing light
a blast from the siren to make sure
but it came to a stop behind the motorway cop
who'd been tailing us for more than an hour
he pulled us out of the car on the side of the road
he questioned us one at a time
where is the gear that we know that you use
we said the only speed we use is on cars
(repeat **)
you should've seen the stupid smirk drop from his face
it was a negative exercise
the way that we dress and the things that we do
they thought it was an easy bust
(repeat *)
when i was a kid they tought me their rules
"we did anything they want, we did it like fools"
"their book was holy, we learned it by heart"
"their holy fight, we had to take part"
exploited and cheated my life was a mess
"religion and war, we were possessed"
"inspired and brave, out to the field"
"so blind that we couldn't see, our destiny was sealed"
"we tried to fight, fell one by one"
"disillusion, our belief had gone"
exploding shell tore off my legs
senses faded by the grenade cracks
"warchild, warchild"
we fought and died for it... we are
"warchild, warchild"
we cried and bleeded for it
wake up now
you came to me within a dream
not everyone is who they seem
all these words we can't redeem
like the great magic of our world
corroborated by your words
splitting planets into thirds
"1, 2, 3, 4"
baby oh baby
baby my baby
baby ooh babe
"i miss you, lalala,"
baby oh baby
baby my babe
baby ooh babe
i miss you
to all the leaves that fall in vain
while god and goddess go insane
all these words in your domain
the watches kill time as the books read
inadvertently we bleed
fighting for what we deceive
baby oh baby
baby my baby
baby ooh babe
"i miss you, lalala,"
baby oh baby
baby my babe
baby ooh babe
i miss you
leave me alone
leave me alone
now why can't you see that you always perturb me so
"nearing the end of the world, just leave me alone,"
leave me alone
why can't you see that you always perturb me so
"nearing the end of the world, leave me alone,"
leave me alone.
baby oh baby
baby my baby
baby ooh babe
"i miss you, lalala,"

baby ooh babe
i miss you

"take a look,what do you see"
image in the mirror
yesterday is yesterday
you'll meet your marker
i know that time grows old
can't stop the seasons
shifting sands slip through your hands
time is gone before it's begun...
die
a little more
a little more for every day
lord why
oh tell me why
do the seasons slowly grey?
days of blue just turn to grey
the picture slowly aging
nothing left to the memory
death will not forsake them
god fearing people say
they are not afraid of dying
so why do they turn to faith
when faith has no meaning in life?
"time worn,worn time"
say goodbye to yesterday
"after life,life after"
it's all the same
the golden years bring out the pain
death rolls in like the seasons change
you've lost all hope but still you pray
aging eyes that fail to see
the mirror has been shattered
death's knocking on their door
a vision filled with laughter
i know that time grows old
can't stop the seasons
and as the end draws near
the story's over before it's begun...
way out in a haunted hollow
a strange chill on a ghostly lake
dark shadows in a twilight haze
a lost cabin in a tree lined maze
nightly apparitions... lost destinations
victims calling from beyond the grave
and now... now they walk the night
searching for the light... one step beyond
beyond the shades of death (shades of death)
the darkest shades of death (shades of death)
beyond the shades
tied... tied to the devil's chair... a sinister affair
terror's drawing near... out on the streets of fear
eyes shine in the black of the night
something's moving but it's out of sight
cryptic symbols in an indian cave
a hitchhiker take you to your grave
a presence in the air... feelings of despair
footsteps walking in the leaves behind you
and now... now they walk the night
searching for the light... one step beyond
the darkest shades of death (shades of death)
beyond the shades of death (shades of death)
the darkest shades
cursed... there's a curse on the ground... terror's drawing near
a dark force all around... out on the streets of fear

all of us are victims
confined by enigmas
without solution
your frozen thoughts don't let you evolve
a prisoner of your own trap
slaves of an infinite pain
what will be the limit?
what will be the end?
life ends
feeling death
slaves of pain
life ends
feeling death
slaves of pain
seeking new paths
don't be tied to your mistakes
run away from this
uncured sickness
open your eyes
don't lose your steps
liberty is a dream
and it is also real
to die to run away
to forget what i've been
to erase my past
to kill my guilt
life ends
feeling death
slaves of pain
the job is done and i go out
another boring day
i leave it all behind me now
so many worlds away
"i meet my girl, she´s dressed to kill"
and all we gonna do
is walk around to catch the thrill
on streets we call the zoo
"we eat the night, we drink the time"
make our dreams come true
and hungry eyes are passing by
on streets we call the zoo
"we eat the night, we drink the time"
make our dreams come true
and hungry eyes are passing by
on streets we call the zoo
enjoy the zoo
and walk down 42nd street
you wanna be excited too
and you will feel the heat
"we eat the night, we drink the time"

"their always say this, say that,"
nothing that you want to

for everything you are

for something you are not
i'd rather you hate me
for everything i am
than have you love me
for something that i aint

i was the sister of your father's in another life
"the father you never knew, who saved me years ago"
and now i'm looking at his son
"a man and his wheelchair, living in the past"
"no room for life, only the dark"
[solo: andy]
i was so close to the end... i will never forget the coffin and nails
but little abigail is back again
"so young and beautiful, while you are living in the past"
"a past so dark, there is no room for life itself"
and all i see when i'm looking at you
is where evil always lived and ruled
you almost killed me... and now you must pay
"a man and his wheelchair, living in the past"
"no room for life, only the dark"
do you even know who the hell it is
"you are keeping in the crypt? ...do you?"""
"fear and twisted hate, then the feeling of being betrayed"
overwhelmed him...
"[a:] ""that child is part of me"""
[solo: mike]
"he had to get up, get up and out of the wheelchair"
"but without his cane, oh he didn't stand a chance"
"the cane was in her hand, she used it to push him back"
"push him in the chest, she was ready for attack"
"then a quick blow to his wrist, four five across his back"
one last one hit him in the neck
"[a:] ""i can't believe you're still alive"
"my god"", she screamed, ""i'll teach you how to die"
this should light up your worthless little life
"open up your eyes"""
then she lit the torch
"his eyes were burning pain, she wanted to hear him scream"
and this was not a dream
abigail was out of control
she was laughing at his every scream
this was no more the clean revenge it should have been
abigail was feeling like the ruler of hell
the joy of causing pain
the wheelchair was really on fire
in the middle of dying. jonathan's charred body was
falling down
twisted forever (twisted sister tribute album)
he spent his life
a silent sentinel
for all to fear
"he walks, he talks, he thinks, he feels"
but no one dare to go near
he takes in all he sees
nothing escapes his gaze
and when he strikes
he strikes for right
a glourious sight
"destroyer, destroyer,"
destroyer
he's in town
he came to be
from a grand mistake
a mystical charade
created to decide the good
and reprecussive aid
as awardness filled his fame
he examined those who leered
then he cleaved the air
with his fiery stare
rend all those there
"destroyer, destroyer,"
destroyer
he's in town
"destroyer, destroyer,"
destroyer
he's in town
a day will come
you'll be drawn into
the center of your town
a came upon a mass of steel
the cracks the very ground
prepare to meet your judge
don't think to run away
just pray your face
holds no disgrace
for the deadly ace
"destroyer, destroyer,"
destroyer
he's in town
"destroyer, destroyer, destroyer"
he's in town

go seek find the red seas fire
blow ship by those sail blind

you try exchanging
no i dont think so
cannot escape me
no sound reason
tired of this
done with that
never satisfied with where i'm at
i sit and think
what to do
just a motherfuckin' bore
without a clue
shot my drugs
drank my booze
tired of joy and self abuse
eternally jaded through and through
just a self loathing fuck
without a clue
oh
bored to death
i'm just bored to tears
same old shit just different day and year
killed myself but that got boring too
so beyond the point where it's not true
far beyond high
dramatically low
eternal stare as if i care to know
all of this struggle
all of this work
in the end you die like some moronic jerk
shot my drugs
drank my booze
tired of joy and self abuse
eternally jaded through and through
just a self loathing fuck
without a clue
oh
bored to death
i'm just bored to tears
same old shit just different day and year
killed myself but that got boring too
so beyond the point where it's not true
colors that i see are all bleeding
the sound that was is now standing still
i wonder when it was it all faded
a dullen corpse that cannot be killed
oh
bored to death
i'm just bored to tears
same old shit just different day and year
killed myself but that got boring too
so beyond the point where it's not true

poised and ready to strike
anticipation of the hunt drawing near
fueled by hatred and spite
if this don't kill them it will fill them with fear
opposing forces now retreat on the run
they got their asses handed to them hours ago
now in pursuit of the survivors who fled
closing the gap soon many more will be dead
attrition breaking the enemy
"detecting tracks, begin the hunt"
where is their savior now?
where do they hide? follow the blood
nothing can save them now
"they will be found, follow the blood"
"enemy spotted, converge, fire at will"
fire at will

dominance will prevail
sent to exterminate
taking them down one by one

death’s maiden showed the way
to death’s grim abode
where death’s wife offered me
death’s drink to have
three words for magic

who has the means to save us from ourselves
to pull us from the vicious cycles feeding back again
"consume and feed, degenerate"
we damage just to liberate
bought and sold before we could even breathe
i feel like we're falling
a lifeline just out of our reach
i feel our collapsing
the arrogant numb to our needs
you're a catastrophe
the one who's come to devastate
catastrophist
you stole our innocence
you're a catastrophe
the one who's come to devastate
catastrophist
we never had a chance
how far along before we fade away
so deeply out of focus but it seems we never cared
"deflect, deny, what flows inside"
the poison springs internalize
bought and sold before we could even breathe
who has the means to save us from ourselves
to pull us from the vicious cycles feeding back again
feeding back again
the bringer of our devastation
you stole our innocence
bringer of our devastation
"it's you, catastrophist"
"consume and feed, degenerate"
we damage just to liberate
"deflect, deny, what flows inside"
the poison springs internalize
we rise with the sun in the underworld
we suffer from a graveless name
we prise wide lids
and wounds with lips curled
over teeth that have tasted shame
cemetary and sundown
against the flora of nightfall
we gather like the fauna of war
to curse aurora so spiteful
with her stake in the coming of dawn
to conjure forth the past
those heady night of pain resplendent
in the service of the goddess of death
when her sheets ran royalty red
moons lengthen our crypt kept silhouettes
"shadows dance, eyes flicker in descent"
"unveil the greed,"
"our needs are bitter, spent"
on upturned mouths and haunts of wickedness
"we walk this eden, a secret"
faces hidden under leonine pride
in dusk's embrace
we find it hard to keep it
when blood and lust and waking worlds collide
too long have we skulked like drifters
in the cities of the neon sun
vagabond dogs and graveyard shifters
mona lisas where the paint has run
i miss our glorious past
our nightly flights on fear dependent
like phantoms in the caves for miss christine
when the song bird broke her neck
wolves howl their foghound serenades
churches arch their backs with balustrades
praise be to the shedding of masquerades
when we hunt these vestal vermin unafraid
of the covenant made.....
draw the blinds on the floors of raw meat
there is murder in the thirst
rich red vascular tapestries
hung in gilded frames of nuns asleep
in dreams where themes of bestiality
are a blessing on their sunday sheep
sermons hang a black gown
over cemetery and sundown
now the clock is harrying midnight
and the ghost of yet to come
will she show rewrites of dark delight
over the sewers we've overrun?
i see a winter palace
cut diamonds at a porcelain neck
when swan lake crushed poor sanity's spirit
as i threw to it bled
we rise with the sun in the underworld
we suffer from a graveless name
we prise wide lids
and wounds with lips curled
over teeth that have tasted shame
"we walk this eden, a secret"
faces hidden under leonine pride
in dusk's embrace
we find it hard to keep it
when blood and lust and waking world collide
prognathous gears grind
so diligent and serrated they mesh
toothed cogs churn
"so trechant, against soft flesh"
worked to the bone
"up to the hilt, depredated"
raw materialism
to stoke the furnaces
"toiling, rotting"
life slowly slips away
"consumed, inhumed"
in this mechanized corruption line
by mincing machinery industrialised - pulped and pulverised
enslaved to the grind
"blood, sweat, toil, tears"
arbeit macht frei/fleisch
grave to the grind
inimitable gears twist
to churn a living grave
stainless cogs shredding
scathing pistons bludgeon and flail
stripping to the bone
retund mandrels levigate
just raw material
your pound of flesh for the suzerain
"toiling, rotting"
life slowly dissipates
"consumed, inhumed"
"in a corruption line, mechanized"
"by mincing machinery, industrialized - crunched and brutalised"
he grew up in a normal home
"real typical, we'd say"
one sister and two brothers
they were comrades for the play
"the video was his best friend,"
he watched it day and night
but death and war was alright
"wild seed, wild seed from the start"
"wild seed, wild seed, injured heart"
he'd seen his daddy drinking
and he learned to asked no whys
when mom was lying on the floor
with tears in her eyes
he went out with his brothers
and they laughed about the hurt
they felt so good and strong
when someone was aching in the dirt
"wild seed, wild seed from the start"
"wild seed, wild seed, injured heart"
"oh, that's really wild"
really wild insane
deep into social hell
he always thought that women
are the servants of men's greed
"and really was, astonished"
when she called for the police
so he lived in a normal jail
"real typical, we'd say"
and yesterday they killed him
when he tried to break away
"wild seed, wild seed from the start"
"wild seed, wild seed, injured heart"
really wild
really wild insane

"the purified that stood the fight, will be saved to see the world of light"
"the rivalry, since eternity, the final fight the blackened world to free"
"lost in hate, determined fate, all evil's damned to walk the fiery gate"
"cold, cold rain"
in my eyes
you'll see your sad reflection
come the rain
although
i'll be there
there's no end
to the pain
of feelings left behind me
"oh, i'm bad"
in my heart
i've been shown
i can try to wipe away the hate
it won't let go
there's got to be some place
i can call my home
there's got to be some place
"cold, cold rain"
in my eyes
the stinging still reminds me
"cold, cold rain, yeah"
all my life
forever

behind blue skies
an angel of death is hidden
waiting to the sin
to the lower levels of hell
"is one of your own, is everywhere"
he lies to people
"in your house, or at school, or at work"
he is your friend
but you shouldn't trust him
no remorse on his fantasy
it's stronger than his real life
wonder how her head would look
"lifeless, on a spear"
what difference it makes?
one less person in the world
what reason he takes to kill them all?
to kill them all? to kill them all?
you're not safe
angels fall to earth
world heats down
cool
now your heart is cold
waiting on the summer
of my soul
devil-girl you must burn
burn at the touch
of autmn's breath
burn that heart of cold
simmering in the samhain
of my soul

come wrap my love in your house of ice
melt you down more than once or twice
make you shake till worlds align
see your body tremble with the blood on fire
'cause the season in my veins
will end your world
to the season of the flames you must pray and learn
change all the things that you've ever seen
change all vision
kill all endings
gotta wait
"on the samhain of my soul, ooh yea"
gonna bring your world

gonna bring your world

gotta wait
"on the samhain of my soul, ooh yea"
gonna bring your world
down in fire
(kerry king)
minutes seem like days
since fire ruled the sky
the rich became the beggars
and the fools became the wise
memories linger in my brain
of burning from the acid rain
a pain i never have won
nothing here remains
no future and no past
no one could foresee
the end that came so fast
hear the prophet make his guess
that paradise lies to the west
so join his quest for the sun
shades of death are all i see
fragments of what used to be
the world slowly decays
destruction fills my eyes
harboring the image
of a spiraling demise
burning winds release their fury
simulating judge and jury
drfiting flurries of pain
deafening silence reigns
as twilight fills the sky
eventual supremacy
daylight waits to die
darkness always calls my name
a pawn in this recurring game
humanity going insane
shades of death are all i see
fragments of what used to be
minutes seem like days
corrosion fills the sky
morbid dreams of anarchy
brought judgment in disguise
memories linger in my brain
life with nothing more to gain
perpetual madness remains
shades of death are all i see
skeletons of society
fragments of what used to be
skeletons of society
bleeding you dry from the start
the sum of my parts
to give it away
new life in a day
some new frankenstein
damned for all time
cursed by the angel who fell
who saves me from hell?
and who is my god?
and where is my soul?
too tired to jump
too young to run
neverending forever searching
"chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart"
always seeking always asking
questions right from the start
out beyond the new frontier
playing god without mercy without fear
create a beast made a man without a soul
is it worth the risk a war of god and man?
"i want to end my life now, but i don't know how"
recycled again a lifetime of pain
the spawn of a man
the devil has planned
neverending forever searching
"chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart"
always seeking always asking
questions right from the start
out beyond the new frontier
playing god without mercy without fear
create a beast made a man without a soul
is it worth the risk a war of god and man?
is it worth the risk a war of god and man?
the fire burns on and on
that drives me on till all is gone
except the simple plans
of mice and men
back when i was just seventeen
i thought that i knew everything
i could make it in this scene
to be a rising star that only gleamed
but all the answers disagreed
with the questions held for me
i was legal now at twenty-one
i knew the way the world should run
my god just look what i had done
simply drunk and having fun
"looked for friends, but i found none"
all alone at twenty-one
the fire burns on and on
that drives me on till all is gone
except the simple plans
of mice and men
at twenty-five i was surprised
that i was even half alive
somehow i managed to survive
i felt my body's doing time
and in my back a hundred knives
from my friends at twenty-five
and now as gabriel sounds my warning bell
"i'd buy your life, if you would sell"
a year or two if less compelled
so live your life and live it well
there's not much left of me to tell
i just got back up each time i fell
the fire burns on and on
that drives me on till all is gone
except the simple plans
of mice and men
witches grow restless
the priest are impatient
my legions scream
the gates must be open
our master repels
a message of hope
on through the gates we march
the sentinels await
with their sabers in grasp
a vast group locust attack
a vast group locust attack
attacking with force
as we show no remorse
obstruction our victims fate
the blood in the chalice
saluting the fight
all virgins must die this night
psychotic reaction from a serpents kiss
is taking the life from your soul
and leading a train of destruction from hell
finding our way through hells hole!
curse of the legions of death
curse of the legions of death
curse of the legions of death
curse of the legions of death
provoke the dead
curse of the legions of death
provoke the dead
curse of the legions of death
by my side
"with venom of steel, the enemy's closing in"
with dark intentions and souls of black
"blood in the wind, a battle that can't be won"
thunder of steel - lightning attack
there is no way out of here
hordes of warriors everywhere
smell of death is drawing near
come and fight me if you dare
fight by my side - i will never let you down
fight for your life - till the end we're standing strong
"hell is unleashed, dead bodies on the ground"
"few against many, that is what counts"
"legions of doom, crush what is left of us"
"we need more men, we're going down"
there is no way out of here
hordes of warriors everywhere
smell of death is drawing near
come and fight me if you dare
fight by my side - i will never let you down
fight for your life - till the end we're standing strong
there is no way out of here
smell of death is drawing near
fight me if you dare
fight by my side - i will never let you down
fight for your life - till the end we're standing strong
fight by my side - i will never let you down
fight for your life - till the end we're standing strong

"by the way, my name is salem."
"you cannot say, that everybody's happy,"
"but you can say, that everybody is now"

when i heard of some mother
by the name of sarah lafayette
who's newborn baby was speaking in the strangest tongue
backwards.
a miracle?
some expert had uttered the word:

we transgress the context of commonplacenes
"we deny normality, trample morality"
we destroy angels with sound
we destroy angels with silence
currents of tantric anarchy seize our bodies
into the cosmic dance of four scythes
the curtains of absurd theatre are raised
synchronicity - mother chaos on the stage
"""wisdom says: be strong!"""
thrilling words are spreading down the spine
"vibrating... ""be strong!"""
exhausted i'm running towards the last shines of consciousness
which is absorbed by shadows of madness

of commonness crippled time or sand
glass you don't see again
"sigillum dei, picture of myself i'm drawing"
"with life, venom and hell i'm sprinkling it"
systematic rape of nature
profit precedes need
maintaining economic stature
steal the fruit yet leave no seed
and our future generations?
what of their inheritance
a world of contamination
poisoned by our ignorance
oblivious to reality
conscience spurned
beyond the point of no return
you know you ain't going nowhere
you're stuck inside while the mind is flying
you said you'd help me in the morning
twisting on pins into my eyes
and we driving on the ceiling below you
facin' up the walls with your crocked hands
while you're miles away for this...
i don't think at all end up like this
there's spiders on the wall and they stink of piss
dead heads lying in the corner
staring at me making me feel bad
i put my hands up to my eyes
but the holes in my palms let me find a way
to corner you...
i can't feel my chest because it ain't much
sucking through my skin into my brain
oxygen pushing on the window
cracks in the glass let it slip away
i start to cry and i keep on laughing
i close my eyes at what's left inside
and then i'll ran away...
for all the time this land
for all the time in my hand
circle around in depth
found calmness fall once again...
razor blades floating in the warm bath
air bubbles in your veins turning my hands black
whispers coming from the next room
window cleaner keep on spying
i put my hands up to my eyes
but the holes in my palms let me find a way
to corner me...
twelve ton hammer for my breakfast
slipping of the edge in catatonic blood
multiple decibel inscriptions
trying all they can in miles an hour
all face grey and looming downwards
sniffing all the time for a ounce of silence
screaming all the way...
numbers counting down inside me
solar system thoughts circle round my head
false teeth hanging from the ceiling
feet looking of the goms of the 2nd son
i eat my hands 'cos my legs are crying
you broke my neck 'cause i snapped my spine
i wish you would die away...
for all the time this land
for all the time in my hand
circle around in depth
found calmness fall once again...
an integral sense comes
with belonging to a scene
supposedly absent of barriers
(when sexism is only one of many).
earnest words
calling for unity of the sexes
"when she's still the chick, or stupid bitch"
(ridiculed for showing an interest).
hidden indifference
strikes an emotion reaction
when you see an animal being abused.
yet un-noticed when a woman
is abused in the same way.
the links of oppression
stem from the same degradation
"but to one, our eyes remain closed."
actively abusing the rights of one
whilst fighting for those of another.
"the &acute; scene &ordf; may hold a different name,"
but the roleplays just the same.
"equal rights are fine,"
as long as she's in her place.
"outrightly denouncing fascism,"
"whilst oblivious to it taking place,"
"is condemnation of standards,"
all an act to save face.
"unity, a stark ambition"
"hard to believe in, strikes like a bad sin"
"life without meaning, is no life at all"
"dreaming victorious, death to be glorious"
conquering new worlds further than before
the violin player in her red gown
cuts the strings to life while golden
feathered keys are struggling
through the lightning path in black and white
frozen tiger statues round us
arbeit macht frei never back
your eyes without a face chasing the medals in disguise
come show me the love that fills your heart
you'll see this moment will redeem the past
and shine tomorrow railroads with your light
"facing the darkness, escaping that madness"
i traveled a long way to find out what is near
"rings of fire, monastery"
"laurel wreath, the bells of glory"
"eagle rising, camels fading"
ancient martial arts we are floating
spiral keeps on round and round
deep into the swamp we are boating
latin veritas and ichiban sharing the sky
come show me the love that fills your heart
you'll see this moment will redeem the past
and shine tomorrow railroads with your light
come show me the love that fills your heart
you'll see this moment will redeem the past
and shine tomorrow railroads with your light
too much in the truth they say
keep it 'till another day
let them have their little game
illusion helps to keep them sane
let them have their little toys
fast sports cars and motor noise
exciting in their plastic waste
frozen food in a concrete maze
you're gonna go insane
i'm trying to save your brain
i don't know what's happening
my head's torns all inside
people say i'm heavy
they don't know what i hide
"take a life, it's going cheap"
"kill someone, no one will weep"
"freedom's yours, just pay your dues"
we just want your soul to use
you're gonna go insane
i'm trying to save your brain
the blade i swing
is black as night
black as my soulless heart
it bears the burden
of many lives
but i don´t feel remorse
i lent my sword
to anyone
willing to pay the price
no regrets for
what i´ve done
a mercenary´s life
but there i was
on battleground
until i felt the jaws of death
cut into my flesh
defending old and weak
but i did not retreat
"now, here i lie"
in my own blood
and strangers cry for me
i´m prepared to meet the gods
i wish they´d let me be
i dont deserve
their sympathy
i know who i am
my soul is death and misery
i am an evil man
i rest in my blood
soon i will face the gods
strangers cry for me
i wish they´d let me be
show no sympathy
shed no tears for me
i know who i am
i am an evil man
i know who i am
i am an evil man
never thought you'd go away
did not believe the things you'd say
now you're gone
i don't understand why you'd leave for some distant land
could you ever feel the same
i'm calling out your name
i still feel the pain
"crying, crying for your love"
"i'm crying, crying for your love"
still i look all over for you
"there's nothing left that i can do, yeah babe"
you're on the streets
you know it's wrong
it's not where a woman belongs
better run while you can
i'm calling out your name
i still feel the pain
"crying, crying for your love"
"i'm crying, crying for your love"
why'd you lead me to the door
can i see you anymore
"crying, crying for your love"
eyes fill with hatred
when they fall upon me
you worship gods of violence and bigotry
forgetting lessons learned that prove these
the wrong ideals
don't let me follow in the footsteps
i won't embrace these wrong ideals
"this thirst for violence, donmination"
it only serves your wrong beliefs
this is my indictment of your beliefs
this is my indictment of what you hold dear
your evil consumes you
a jealous few incite ignorant followers
invoke the name and watch the masses turn on us
for fear that i embody what you fear
this is my indictment of your beliefs
this is my indictment of what you hold dear
my eyes have seen the horrors that you
commit in the name of your god
"your god is violence, your god is unholy"
eyes fill with hatred when they fall upon me
invoke the name and watch the masses turn on us
for fear that i embody what you fear
"your god is violence, your god is unholy"
coward!
spit!
i think i'll spit!
for all those girls who speak contradiction
the guy who crept through the shadows every day
to clutch his own conclusion
watch all the blood
as it drips from your veins
you coward
godspeed
may your death come quickly
i think i'll take this hate and
spit!
spit!
spit!
now as it's passed onto the next one
i feel a bloodrush come right over me
you know you will never be right in the eyes
of the ones who know
you trusted the devil
and she will betray you
low..
why do i get sh*t!
all the time!
from these men!
you are swine!
you think dick is the answer
but it's not!
why do i get sh*t!
all the time!
from these men!
you are swine!
you think dick is the answer
but it's not!
hero on video
the hero on video
it smells like revolution
but you've never gone astray
"through an endless persecution, of heroes on video"

"knock, knock! who comes around?"
"come and go, go"
"come we go, we'll never surrender"
"goodbye, bad times"

monstrous
my thoughts
"revolting visions, carnage"
bloodbath
my dream
gore soaked
my hands
"hallucination, or real"
i wield
the blade
grotesque...mind...grotesque
visions
murder
"see myself slashing, the throats"
victims
my friends
horror
my crimes
"fiendish memory, did i"
kill them
i must know
did i kill them?
life long friend
cut off his head
how can this be i butchered them
why would i slaughter them?
who gave me this knife to kill them
"with, how could i chop them up?"
survey my massacre
fragments of my comrades carpet
the ground below
i want to escape
stab myself suicide wake me up and set me free
[solo: pat]
grotesque...mind...grotesque
did i kill them?
did i kill them?
i'm all alone
nothing to help me through the night.
i wait by the phone
hoping that everything's allright...allright.
no one can tell you
is it wrong or is it right.
but how am i supposed to know.
there's got to be an answer
to ease my soul
is it you...is it you?
i need your promise
"a promise that i never needed anyone before,"
never needed anyone before.
so don't try to push me away
"'cos i just keep coming back for more,"
coming back for more.
no one can tell you
if it's wrong or if it's right.
but how am i supposed to know.
there's got to be an answer
to ease my soul
is it you...is it you?
"i want you,i need you"
from the bottom of my heart.
"just tell me, i just got to know."
"can you see me,please believe me"
i loved you from the start.
"please tell me, i just got to know."
no one can tell you
if it 's wrong or if it's right.
but how am i supposed to know.
there's got to be an answer
to ease my soul.
you're the only one who knows.
the answer to the question is deep inside
"it's you,it's you! it's you,it's you!"
god only knoiw's it's you!
welcome to an empty fortress
a mighty wreck that once was proud
ate alive by oxidation
abandoned by a crew of cowards
navigation systems failed
computers crashed and they all fall down
possibly i've seen too much
hangar 18 i know too much
all the guilty paid the price
suspended by their broken necks
no one survived to tell the story
when foreign life forms resurrect
and military intelligence is
still two words that can't make sense
possibly i've seen too much
hangar 18 i know too much
shadows may hide you but also may be your grave.
"you're running today, maybe tomorrow you'll be saved."
you pray for daylight to save you for a while.
you wonder if your children will face the killer's smile.
"dead men - tell no tales,"
in gangland - murder's up for sale.
"dead men - tell no tales,"
in gangland - where the jailbirds die.
face at the window leers into your own.
"but it's only your reflection, still you tremble in your bones."
how long can you hide? how long 'til they come?
a rat in a trap but you've got to survive.
once you were glad to be free for a while.
the air tasted good and the world was your friend.
then came the day when the hard times began.
now you're alone but alive for how long?
"a knife at your throat, another body on the pile."
a contract to keep and it's service with a smile.
murder for vengeance or murder for gain.
death on the streets or a blacked out jail.
"dead men - tell no tales,"
in gangland - murder's up for sale.
"dead men - tell no tales,"
in gangland - where the jailbirds die.
in gangland you tell no tales.
welcome to this piece of joy
this music will transpose you to
some place you´ve never been before
the never ending dance beggins...
we´re back from the ancient days
we have new spells
we´ve learned in some different island from here
close your eyes and be welcome
and this green land that you always dream
but have never been
from somewhere far away
you brought it here to stay
"pandora's box, unlocked, disturbed"
and while we slept at night
it turned off all the lights
we were completely unprepared
we light a candle in this black room
after they locked our house of pain
there is no window in this black room
and from outside we hear the rain
now we stay lonely home
we mistrust everyone
and live behind our masks unknown
while madness breaks the rules
to separate the fools
so many of us die alone
we light a candle in this black room
after they locked our house of pain
there is no window in this black room
and from outside we hear the rain
one day the clouds may open up
the sun comes out again
and it's breaking out loud
this is what it's about
then we know that it's the people
the echoes of ourselves
"do you remember, my friend"
when i was frozen and dead inside?
a piece of nothing in this world
till i heard she said
three nights of hell
immortality spell (spell)
light up the skies
make it through the darkness
"can you believe this, my friend?"
i was empty and broken inside
she came to save me from the storm
"blood, tears, dust"
three nights of hell
immortality spell (spell)
light up the skies
make it through the darkness
three nights of hell
immortality spell (spell)
light up the skies
make it through the darkness
"blood, tears, dust"
"take my blood, tears, dust"
time belongs to you and i
there's nowhere else
i wished i could be
mountains high
dark river flows
the wind will blow
our fire will burn again
"(blood, spell, darkness)"
three nights of hell
immortality spell (spell)
light up the skies
make it through the darkness
"we can win, we can lose"
we can swallow the bad news
in the end we all know
our life is just a show
everybody plays a game and in our hearts
there's hidden our real face
who is the man who says
i'm never gonna cry
it's a lie - it's a lie
and who is the girl who says
i'm never gonna sigh
it's a lie - it's a lie
on the way to nowhere
in the falling rain
i've come to makin' my mind up
to get to the point
and here i go again
who is the man who says
i'm never gonna cry
it's a lie - it's a lie
no i'm not the man who says
i'm never gonna die
"but i'm alive, still alive - alive"
we are not guilty
we never know the way it goes
just like heroes - heroes - heroes
an all day routine
we can be deadly wounded
but we can stand the pain
we might lose the battle but for our ideals
we stand right up and start to fight again
we all know our enemies but only god knows
who will fall lean back and lick your wounds
fight them all for you
you are not guilty
you never know the way it goes
just like heroes - heroes
who is the man who says
i'm never gonna cry
it's a lie - it's a lie
no i'm not the man who says
i'm never gonna die
"but i'm alive, still alive"
heroes - heroes - heroes
we are heroes - heroes
shifting through the ashes
in scratching through my life
how sick is it to live with the promises
no rhyme or reason
expect another fight
and my decisions are based on your ignorance
and i blame you
for everything you do
for all the scars i bear
and breathing all my air
for everything i ever do
i blame you
i'm taking every prisoner
through the ups and downs
and my ship ain't gonna sink to the hypocrites
reach deep inside me
and tear away my soul and
nobody left to comfort me anymore
and i blame you
for everything you do
for all the scars i bear
and breathing all my air
for everything i ever do
i blame you
i blame you
for everything you do
for all the scars i bear
and breathing all my air
for everything i ever do
i blame you
ooooh i blame you
ohhhh i blame you
aahhh i blame you
ooooh...

empty vessel under the sun wipe the dust
from my face another morning black sunday
"coming down again,coming down again"
"empty vessel empty veins,"
empty bottle wish for rain that pain again

my brain and i feel that pain again
i´m looking over my shoulder coz millions
will whisper in killing myself again maybe
i´m dying faster but nothing ever lasts i
remember a night from my past when i was
stabbed in the back and its all coming
back and i feel that pain again
i abhor you i condemn you coz this pain
will never end you got away without a
scratch and now youre walking on a lucky
path i have to laugh but youd better watch
your back
there´s pathetic opposition they´re the
cause of my condition ill be coming back
for them ive a solution for this sad
situation nothing left but to kill myself
again because i´m so empty!
climb down my pile
and again to the beat of my heart
you're so exciting
take all the soul
i will give you as much as you want
control my feelings
"higher, much higher"
unbounded fire
"closer, come closer"
close to the core
"we burn, we burn"
i contaminate you
i like to pollute you with my
g-g-generations
look in my eyes
and we melt into on yearning mind
we climb the stages
"higher, much higher"
unbounded fire
"closer, come closer"
close to the core
"we burn, we burn"
"insanity, insanity"
never set me free
these gardens of angst
in which i stand
lost and confused
hungry for more
eager to cross
this river of tears
safe in this void
in which i live
free from despair
weaving a web
surrounding my soul
imprisoned distress
in a world of dying angels
trespassers on unknown domains
traumatic defeat
this time i'll burn
for one thousand years
bearing the truth
deep down inside
it dies with me
taste the pure salt
of misery
hell's ecstasy
feel destiny
breathe in your neck
cut you so deep
twisting my mind
living in sin
dying within
wicked and mean
sinister eyes
staring at me
darkness has covered the opera house
something is wrong you can fell
there's a devil in disguise
a traitor has taken the dais
catalogue people spend a pitying gaze
what can a man do in such a case
aristocratic experts on art vomit all over the place
and they wish i'd be doomed eternally
forever french-frying
you'd love to see me dying
wo's let the peacock in to
rock the house - opera house
you want me french-fried and
you'd love to see me fired and
then kill judas in the opera house
opera house
huntsmen are rushing around
after the peacock oh no
the baton is pink and it's clear: he is a queer
he likes it into his rear
rumors arise he is from outerspace
they're out for the bounty
and still they're amazed
aristocratic lemmings with a highsnobiety leer
get the chef to make peacock fillet steak
we came from a solar system far away
facing your goggle eyes
to protect this jolly bedlam from decay
facing your goggle eyes
who do you think you are
to think you're off a better class?
who do you think you are
to expect us to kiss your ass?
we've come to chase the monkey off your back
facing your goggle eyes
and we're expected some may sound an attack
facing your goggle eyes
who do you think you are
to think you're of a higher class?
who do you think you are
to expect us to kiss your ass?
we're gonna be
taking a chance - taking the chance
to get you darting a glance - darting a glance
at us starting to prance - starting the dance
of the oddballs
and you're invited
taking the chance - taking the chance
to get you darting a glance - darting a glance
at us starting to prance - starting to dance
of the oddballs
frankenstein is out of control
donkey has been given a soul
flamboyantly he's playing his song
and they can't get it
the nuthead he is going insane
the screwball is igniting the flame
pandora's box has opened behold
madness rising
[solo]
you say treason but i tell you
there ain't no reason
we just have our share
we don't care as long as we're alive
love our sound and like to hear:
where's the chef to make judas-fillet-steak
right now!
here i am understand
with this comes frustration
a better way to follow through
i'm far from done
the truth is right there in front of you
a better way to follow through
i'm far from done
the truth is right there in front of me
realize through my eyes
i can't speak so damn weak
the face before me shows
what my life will be
everybody knows
everyone but me!
better follow
the truth is right there in front of you
better follow
the truth is right there in front of me
break the bread and drink the wine
seize the challace suck the poison vine
there is frost in every sunbeam? water flows from the earth to sky
looking down on every rose nothing moves the wheal of heaven turns
"as our fingers leave they trace, we are gods and the world returns ,up rise?."
"now we're lost you can't desguise, the river of no return"
"now its time you realise, the river of no return"
growing embers of our ancient lives
we struggle hard we live to turn the tide
living longer in the 'astro-wast'
"we stare each other, we looked death in the face"
"all my life in front of you, lonely secrets hidden from your view."
"now we obit a different sun, for eternity ,doomed to tell no one.."
"now we're lost you can't desguise, the river of no return"
"now its time you realise, the river of no return"
solo
"now and truly all alone,"
canyon walls and the river of no return
"im amazed at what i am,"
i've never knew the feelings i've ignored
"now we're lost you can't desguise, the river of no return"
"now its time we realise, the river of no return"
"and the anguish drives me on ,i wish i could return"
all alone and washed away to the river of no return
"i don't believe in fame,"
i believe in music
"i don't believe in money,"
i believe in the power of love
i know i got a brain
and i know how to use it
i don't want no one
to stick his finger in my pie
you think you put your best foot forward
but it is moved by someone else
in blind belief
you follow every path that says:
fame and luck
do you really wanna be
rich and famous
i don't believe in rock 'n' roll illusions
i don't believe that what they say
must always be the truth
i don't believe in good guys
against bad guys
i just might as well say
i believe in santa claus
you think you put your best foot forward
but it is moved by someone else
in blind belief
you follow every path that says:
fame and luck
do you really wanna be
"rich and famous, rich and famous"
do you really wanna be
rich and famous now
mr. big shot what is your game
mr. big shot what is your final aim
now you wonder who is to blame
mr. big shot what is your final aim in life
"rich and famous, house with two hours,"
"big jacuzzi, car with tv"
"private airplane, furs and diamonds,"
seafood cocktails
crap and bullshit!
do you really wanna be
"rich and famous, rich and famous"
do you really wanna be
rich and famous now
narrator:
"the moon, the sign of hope"
it appeared when we left the pain of the ice-desert behind
we faced up to the curse and endured misery
condemned we are
"we brought hope, but also lies, and treachery"
feels like i'm covered in lies
"so turn off the light, i'm closing my eyes"
flying back - ages ago
curtain is down and i'm ready to go
back to the day when i looken into your eyes
straight to your heart - when i knew
you've been telling me lies
even the day when we met
i'll always recall with the deepest regret
tell me what keeps you awake:
talk of the angel or soul of the snake?
how can you live in your shadow from within
hiding away from the light in the river of sin?
"lies, neverending lies, i see it in your eyes"
did you stop believing ?
"lies always cold as ice, even heaven cries"
"for you, but not forgiving"
lies - the way to paradise you're gonna pay the price
on the field of growing lies
neverending lies need a sacrifice -
you're the one who's going down
dealing with you on my own
loosing my faith so i have to be strong
crossing the sea of mistrust while
looking for gold which you covered with dust
we fought the truth
as long as we lived our love
fearing all the solutions we found
we drowned ourselves
in the lake of tears that we cried
'til we found out that love is its ground
"call me a fool, but i'm not"
our love changed - and love changed me
i kept waiting for your answer
then i found out the answer was you
no more riddles of my longings
now i know that the answer is you
"i want to thank you, my creator"
i still wouldn't live my life without you

rumbling thunder cracks the sky. and rain starts pouring down. lightning strikes a cold bright light. upon the bloodrenched ground.
the sword play is hard. and many falls. steel bites sharp in flesh.
and upon a mountain. towering tall. stands the messengers of death.
five horsemen in armour bright. waiting in the flashing light. looking down upon the field. where vikings fight with axe and shield.
on stallions black as night. with eyes burning red. they ride with thunder to the fight. deliverance of certain death.
a warcry loud as heimdall's horne. echoes across the land. enemies who hear it freeze to the bone. friends of doom proudly stands.
they ride faster than the wind. with lighting speed they strike. black ravens follow where they've been. to feed from those died.
with power they vield their swords. as they ride down fleeing men. sending them to hel's dark court. to never come back again.
the warriors ride once more. to the mountain from which they came. once sent by the gods to war. and they never return in shame.
nailed! with fear of getting away
fucked! they won't let you get out
rotted for faith on how to live life
got any balls! who's going first!
pass on through
to something new
go without fear
crossover
those borders
go without fear
go for it!
be the first one
go without fear
i'll go first!!
wetbacks - over there you ain't human
doped - the most potent
mental borders because your difference
"don't be a fool, who's going first?"
dead - in this life
ready - for the other way out
screams from the people scared of death
"to the next life, go without fear"
fatalistic ships froma distant shore
in the back of my mind i could see she was standing there
like the feeling you have
when you've been there before
she was a gypsy woman
she was as cold as the day
she said i'd got it coming
and then she took me away
she took me through the shadows of her sunken dream
"i thought it's over me,she wasn't all she seemed"
she took my hand and then she started to speak
she told me she'd had the call
with eyes of fire that were burning my soul
she looked into her crystal ball
she read my fortune then she read my mind
she didn't like my thoughts at all
"she showed me shadows,a spectre of life"
my soul just wanted to scream
she stared so deeply into my eyes
that's when i fell into a dream
when i awoke in bed she lay beside me
"and she read me with her eyes,she said"
"so you wanna be a gypsy,come on now"
gypsy woman you're the devil in drag
you are the queen of all hell
"you took my body,now you're wasting my soul"
you've got me under your spell
and as the sun shines on another day
"you're gonna take my mind as well,it's over"
"so you wanna be a gypsy,come on now."
closing my mouth
before i scream
no-one can shake
my self-esteem
whisper my name
confuse my mind
to me it's the same
if i'll survive
this game you can't win
who is free from sin
i won't be afraid
my soul will remain
go on and sleep
the sleep of the just
if your conscience is clean
do what you must
one day you will know
"i was a friend, not foe"
i won't be afraid
my soul will remain
let go of your hate
i won't be afraid
i won't be afraid
my soul will remain
let go of your hate
"i won't be afraid, oh no..."
so you see i've gotten this far
please give me some place to wait
"i'm not trying to go there, so take me away"
life sometimes pisses me off
it's never a good trip for me
"every time i reach for love, it's taken away"
"night, so i play"
"give me a sign, this is day"
"give me some patience, so i pray"
"it's time to die, is that what i want?"
there's nothing wrong wanting to be loved
is there something wrong with me?
once in my life i'd like to be really set free
let me be me
"night, so i play"
"give me a sign, this is day"
"give me some guidance, so i pray"
"it's time to die, is that what i want?"
take me away.. taken away..
take me away.. taken away..
"night, so i play"
"give me a sign, this is day"
"give me some patience, so i pray"
"it's time to die, is that what i want?"

you've been fighting for much too long
you saw the future and what to come
"restless spirits out on the run,"
among the shadows of the sun
you are the rising resistance now
we´ve come to show you a way somehow
"beyond the past and in secrecy,"
"we found it all, but we want more"
we come from the age of chivalry
"metal machines, unchained and free"
we are here for you to see
"flying on wings of steel,"
"thundering, we are breaking the seal"
"fighting for the oath we sworn,"
to spread the word of a legend reborn
moving silent like a gentle breeze
we´re the troops of metal and we do as we please
"we are the restless, we are the wild,"
burning hearts that never die
we are going against the tide
"the hammer has fallen, a thorn in your side"
break the silence or take the fall
the mighty templars will take it all
"welcome the age of chivalry,"
where we all will be set free
it´s the time for you and me
"flying on wings of steel,"
"thundering, we are breaking the seal"
"fighting for the oath we sworn,"
to spread the word of a legend reborn
sons and brothers fight or fall
with our sisters and daughters
we´re standing one for all
"flying on wings of steel,"
"thundering, we are breaking the seal"
"fighting for the oath we sworn,"
to spread the word of a legend reborn
"flying on wings of steel,"
"thundering, we are breaking the seal"
"fighting for the oath we sworn,"
to spread the word of a legend reborn
i see the beauty in the miracles revelead
i need the golden sparkles just to climb the tree
but sometimes i get scared and find it hard to stand
when all the violence is coming down on me
sometimes i wonder
how can we ever be strong in this world
without a hand that can lead us unhurt
how can we look into this empty face
all of us unembraced
i taste the bitter truth that makes me understand
there are some questions that might never be answered
"and all their poison sweet, the prayers and belief"
just let them gently sleep while i must stay awake
how can we ever be strong in this world
without a hand that can lead us unhurt
how can we look into this empty face
all of us unembraced
i'll stay awake
i'll stay awake
oh can we try to be strong in this world?
we are the hand that can lead us unhurt
beauty of lies deep in the wonders unveiled
love is the mirror for us to be free
are you still unembraced
i feel cold
facing the darkness
the light's gone away
deep in his castle he said
all land'll be mine
there's one thing for sure
the triumph of shadow is near
deep in his castle they sang
we shall not rest
until all will be thyne
all land is mine
you can be sure
don't dare me
the mighty one screamed
smashed down the light
i will not rest till i'm king
valinor's empty now
allied the elves and men
they shall be damned
rise or fall
a dark tale ends
just wondering how
in the darkness
they found their way
to the right place
children of sun
second kindred
we call their race
treat them kindly
born in the east
(are the) nightfearer
they moved westwards
towards the sunshine
(they are) morning breath like
short's their life
(like) dawn passes by
when the day comes
the field was lost
(and) hope had passed away
the sun went down
beyond the sea
dark was the hour
but day shall come again
smashed down the light
i will not rest till it's done
valinor's empty now
allied the elves and men
they shall be damned
clean my wounds
wash away all fear
let courage be mine
noone hears me crying
no song no tale
which contains all the grief
(but)
renowned the deeds
and the victims of defeat
sit down on your chair
and look out for your kin
with my eyes you'll see
and with my ears you'll hear
you troubled my day
and you've questioned my strength
(but) don't mess
with the master of fate
smashed down the light
i will not rest till it's done
valinor's empty now
allied the elves and men
they shall be damned
i smashed down the light
and dared valinor
i smashed down the light
revenge will be mine
slowly marching on
still we're marching on
i am hunting for your soul
it dwells within your heart
i lacerate the pounding flesh
your spirits shall be mine
so rise my spirit rise!
revel in this dead mans' body
"grip his soul, sip the blood"
life is death
a holy carnage
ravenous
i will be god
carnivorous jesus
i need your flesh
ritual slaughter
fill up the chalice
with the essence of your life
liquid strengths
trapped in your veins
i crave your blood
you must die!
ravenous
i will be god
carnivorous jesus
i need your blood
through your fear i am reborn
my hand of grief can't be ignored
"you know my name, yeah you know who i am"
"frustrated turmoil, again and again"
i am the spike which drives through your hand
"for i am eternal, battering ram."
i kill myself to see you die
"as you suffer, tears of joy come to my eyes"
"you know my name, yeah you know who i am"
frustrated turmoil again and again
i am the spike which drives through your hand
"for i am eternal, the battering ram."
"you know my name, yeah you know who i am"
frustrated turmoil again and again
i am the spike which drives through your hand
"for i am eternal, battering ram."
"you know my name, yeah you know who i am"
frustrated turmoil again and again
i am the spike which drives through your hand
"for i am eternal, a battering ram."
"you know my name, yeah you know who i am"
frustrated turmoil again and again
i am the spike which drives through your hand
"for i am eternal, battering ram."
"a lifeless object, alive"
awaiting reprisal
death will be their acquisition
he sky is turning red
return to power draws near
"fall into me,"
the sky's crimson tears
abolish the rules made of stone
"pierced from below, souls of my treacherous"
past
"betrayed by many,"
now ornaments dripping above
awaiting the hour of reprisal
your time slips away
raining blood
from a lacerated sky
bleeding its horror
creating my structure
"hell-hound, hot leather on your legs"
that smokin powder keg
you're riding on is hell-bound
and you're the one they claim
it's going down in flames
you're riding hades' rails (hellion)
hellion -the devil's hellion child
hellion -will never have to die
"well child, you're sweatin' and you're stoned"
that alcohol you downed
"makes you crazy- all night, you damn the hurt and pain"
and drink the devils rain
it's screaming out your name
hellion -the devil's hellion child
hellion -will never have to die
the gods you worship are steel
at the altar of rock 'n' roll you kneel
a slave who forever rocks
is chained in the devil's locks
and slain by the bloody axe i wail
hellion -the devil's hellion child
hellion -will never have to die
"from: w.a.s.p. ""winged assassins"""
"well, i got time on my side as i roll the dice"
there is something out there waiting for me
and i see roads without signs that can lead you blind
and the lonely way is easy to take
hold on - hold on tighter
it's a long way to where i'm going
meet me in a seventh sky
see me at the sunset station
above the twilight i'll be flying there
it's just the state i'm in
can't stop myself from dreaming
won't stop believing i'll be flying there
somewhere in a seventh sky
and as our life is told and we're growing old
collecting pieces of the dreams we've been chasing
brothers ans sisters of sin
who's gonna loose and who's gonna win
need a crystal ball to show me the way
move on - move on faster
it's a long way to where i'm going
meet me in a seventh sky
see me at the sunset station
above the twilight i'll be flying there
it's just the state i'm in
can't stop myself from dreaming
within the starlight i'll be flying there
meet me in a seventh sky
see me at the sunset station
above the twilight i'll be flying there
it's just the state i'm in
won't stop believing
can't stop myself from dreaming
meet me in a seventh sky
see me at the sunset station
above the twilight i'll be flying there
it's just the state i'm in
won't stop believing
can't stop myself from dreaming
i got time on my side
within the starlight i'll be flying there
somewhere in a seventh sky
[part i - at the four corners of the earth]
on the edge of paradise
"tears of woe fall, cold as ice"
hear my cry
"renounce, have you, thy name"
eternal is my pain
eternal is the pain that leads me
to the thrones of temptation
eternal is the pain that leads me
to the thrones of temptation ...
[part ii - in the room of thrones]
[instrumental]
[part iii - a gathering of angels]
there was a time ...
when nine choirs sang the
endless melody of light
music of the spheres
threre was a place ...
where mortals embraced thunder
and majesty
their fate lay in our hands
feel my wings slowly fading -
forever lost in time - i cry
[part iv - the wrath divine]
the burning conflict i'm feeling
it summons me to descend into
the other side
and just beyond the stars blazing
"a beam light from a red, velvet"
moon illuminates me
"i will devise, from perfect skies"
a dark and vengeful day
faith and mercy gone astray
with strength of infinite measure
the mighty sword divides order
from chaos in the kingdom below
"and from the mansions of glory,"
this empty soul cries out one
final plea ...
the end has begun
"our worlds collide, now in"
"disguise,"
you'll feel the wrath divine
tears of woe fall from the sky ...
[part v - the prophet's cry]
the prophet cries
vast battalions rage on in the sky
rising from the north
- the bringer of war
eve of destruction
summon all who have 'power
over fire'
impending doom from shore to
shore
standing on the edge of paradise
i sacrifice my truth and loyalty
seven deadly sins consume you
"all, a dance with death"
i taste the victory
(eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)
rising from the north
- the warrior prince
judgement without compassion
eyes of fear
"like the river styx,"
the gates of hell -
"""abandon hope all ye who enter here"""
the prophets cry
as armies fall from the edge of
the sky
"the prince of truth, now the"
bringer of war
the day of wrath
banish all kings from the face of the land
dominion for strength is my
name
[part vi - bringer of the apocalypse]
[instrumental]
eve of sacrifice/armies in the sky/dies trae
[part vii - paradise regained]
looking out on a blue sky
i can see a new world arising
like a prisoner unbound
i feel the power and the majesty
again
looking up to the heavens
i can see what i left behind
"beneath the stars, moon and"
warm sun
"and all i know,"
is my paradise has begun ...
"there is a town in north, ontario"
with dream comfort memory spare
and in my mind i still need a place to go
all my changes were there
"blue, blue windows behind the stars"
yellow moon on the rise
big birds flying across the sky
throwing shadows on our eyes
"leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless"
"leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless"
"baby, can you hear me now?"
the chains are locked and tied
across the door
"baby, sing with me somehow"
"helpless, helpless, helpless"
"leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless"
"helpless, helpless, helpless"
"leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless"
"helpless, helpless, helpless"
"leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless"
"there is a town in north, ontario"
with dream comfort memory spare
and in my mind i still need a place to go
all my changes were there

"how lies of ""death or glory"""
feeding on the gun
"""this is the war of intrigues"
this is the war of pain

a spiral that leads on to hell
"the war, well it came with a lie"
"the war, where the monarchy died"

"their ""tank"" was on the move now"
"""entente"" was its name"
[pre]
a shot in sarajewo
tactic of blatant lies
this was a deadly cocktail
and common sense really died
gas into the fire
"the ""shield"" was flaming ""red"""
the world became a pyre
"widows, broken and sad"
the war is a bundle of intrigues
the war is still raging on
"the war, a creation of soulfreaks"
the war until they are gone
the war is a taste of hellfire
the war is the downfall of man
the war is the trade of the liar
the war again and again
the war is a bundle of intrigues
the war is still raging on
"the war, a creation of soulfreaks"
the war until they are gone
the war is the war is the war
[byford/quinn/oliver/dawson/gill]
where were you in '79 when the dam began to burst
did you check us out down at the local show
"were you wearing denim, wearing leather"
did you run down to the front
did you queue for your ticket through the ice and snow
denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
did you read the music paper from the back and to the front
did you find out where to see your favorite band
did you listen to the radio every friday night
did hang around your local record store
denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
do you dream of playing guitar or smashing up the drums
maybe you can learn to play the bass
you can always be a singer like me and front the band
when on the stage we wait at your command
denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
it was you - that set the spirit free
it was you - that put us here today
it was you - that filled the concert halls
it was you - that set the spirit free
denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
denim and leather
brought us all together
it was you that set the spirit free
[repeat to end]
don't fear the darkness
let it find you if it must
open the door and
embrace the sadness
pain won't stain you
it will only make you strong
hurt won't haunt you
but lead you where you belong
let your grief fade away
"he's a guest, not here to stay"
for one more day
"keep the flame, let it burn"
through the night let it shine
a light divine
for few are those who
see with their own eyes
few who feel with their own hearts
and few are those who
reach for the stars and
few who do more than their part
let the daylight wipe away your fears
for this is your life
and nothing can hold you back
take a moment
take a breath and start again
you're not broken
and it can't rain all the time
"keep the flame, let it burn"
through the night let it shine
a light divine
for few are those who
see with their own eyes
few who feel with their own hearts
and few are those who
reach for the stars and
few who do more than their part
for few are those who
see with their own eyes
few who feel with their own hearts
and few are those who
reach for the stars and
few who do more than their part
for few are those who
see with their own eyes
few who feel with their own hearts
and few are those who
reach for the stars and
few who do more than their part
"on a cold dark winter night, hidden by the stormy light"
"a battle rages for the right, for what will become"
"in the valley of the damned, a warrior with sword in hand"
"travels fast across the land, for freedom he rides"
and the sign from the master on high
he screams aloud and across hear the cry
for the kingdom of fire and ice
and the power to be alive
"be strong ride on, carry on through the war"
"come along carry on, living for ever more"
"on the wings of death, by the hands of doom"
"by the darkest light, from the darkest moon"
"crossing silent seas, over mountains high"
for we stand as one tonight
on the black wind forever we ride on together
destroying your evil with freedom our guide
when the master will call us
he'll stand high before us
our hearts filled with splendour
our swords will shine over the light
in the valley of the damned
days breaks with golden strand
over pastures green it glows
to where night returns
in the shadows faces appear
warriors wearing full metal gear
join together one and all before the glorious light
"rise up, gather round, come and hear what is said"
use your senses open your mind don't you ever forget
"on the wings of life, by the hands of hope"
by the brightest light from the brightest sun
crossing silent seas over mountains high
to the valley of the damned!
on the black wind forever we ride on together
destroying your evil with freedom our guide
when the master will call us
he'll stand high before us
our hearts filled with splendour
our swords will shine over the light
-solo-
on the black wind forever we ride on together
destroying your evil with freedom our guide
when the master will call us
he'll stand high before us
our hearts filled with splendour
our swords will shine over the light
on the black wind forever we ride on together
destroying your evil with freedom our guide
when the master will call us
he'll stand high before us
our hearts filled with splendour
our swords will shine over the light...

jets lift off
armed to go
sights lock on
targets below
objects marked
cue bomb bay
pull the trigger
bombs away
say your last goodbyes
we're coming to your skies
a reckoning this day
you threatened our shores
so now we'll come to yours
and make you all pay
bombs away
bombs away
bombs away
shells explode
flashing light
burning fires
turn day to night
head on back

you don't stand a chance
air force has advanced

fuck ‘em all
nothing you can do
we're coming after you
today is the day
pay for what you've done

digesting deceit
i'm broken faulted
and that just better for me
this situation intrigues
i am assaulted
i don't know how i succeed
(bow down) where am i now?
(somehow) a plaything at your discretion now
pulling away this veil i see
realize this path's not meant for me
stripped away are all my needs
and now all that's left is forgotten
i want to be free
you won't allow it
it makes me drop to my knees
what must i do to appease?
my effort's scalded
i guess i'll have to concede
(bow down) where am i now?
(somehow) a plaything at your discretion now
pulling away this veil i see
realize this path's not meant for mе
stripped away are all my needs
and now all that's left is forgottеn
one day i must decide if i'm worth it
gave it life and i realized it took it
don't feel bad for me
don't feel sad for me
don't feel bad for me

a wrinkled gnome sat on the yard
on this sailing vessel he was the guard
"he may brought safety, or he may brought dread"
"if he was treated well, or if he was treated bad"
"guardian, evil spirit"
"tormentor, evil spirit"
he watched the blade and his anger grew
'cause for his own wealth he skinned hard their crew
money and fame were his conviction
violence and force were his religion
"guardian, evil spirit"
"tormentor, evil spirit"
the reef appeared too fast for him
he tried to duck but wind refreshed
"the yard came down, the gnome was gone"
"the blade was dead, justice had won"
"guardian, evil spirit"
"tormentor, evil spirit"
do you see me in the light
all the ember i ignite
you can't control my will
i will sign your testament
"it's a prophecy, no argument"
"when the sun goes down, my time has come"
you will hear the beat of the drums
i'm your death trap
well i'm your sign of fear
death trap
you can't disappear
i'm your death trap
you will crawl and taste the mud
death trap
until you're drenched in blood
well my mission will be done
you will hear the sound of a gun
rising up from the ashes
only your memory remains
in god we trust
"when the sun goes down, my time has come"
you will hear the beat of the drums
my eyes will watch every move
and if you think you're safe
your life will turn to you
break me down and roll me once again
got no time to think of now and then
catch my breath pick myself up off the floor
"one more drink, a nervous breakdown, then another war"
"oh, you can never get too low when youre so damn high"
"oh, been out rolling on the blessed hellride"
"through the lines, aint no in betweens"
"gardens of filth, the obscure and the obscene"
"catch my breath, pick myself up off the floor"
"one more drink, a nervous breakdown, then another war"
"oh, you can never get too low when you're so damn high"
"oh, been out rolling, on the blessed hellride"
"you can never get too low when youre so damn high,"
on the blessed hellride
"oh, you can never get too low when you're so damn high"
"oh, been out rolling, on the blessed hellride"
"you can never get too low when youre so damn high,"
on the blessed hellride
throughout our time a thought
"escapes us to enforce a word, no"
holding on to pain it may seem to some
"the easy way to say o.k., twist your"
knife a little deeper
words to sharp actions dark
hide the blade of the deceiver.
"enforce the words no more, be free"
alone you might just find serenity.
to accept another day we choose
to give away another piece of life
to forgive is to suffer
[solo schuldiner]
once or twice is kind
three or four is blind
it is not the end yet a way to begin
the power of words both good and bad.
men with both roots and wings
they tie us down and ask us to leave
"they are teachings unheard, they are bodies on smoke"
men with both roots and wings
at a singular voice we moan
"our teachings mislead, our teachings like smoke"
we sleep between the storm that was
and the storm which has to come
we've learnt to learn everywhere
and the very own nature has taught us to wait
"difference does sound like sin ,equality reliefs"
and that fame ryhmes with hate yet everything is fair
on the intervals of your death
misguided demons or forthcoming heroes
each one with an important name
nothing else than an important name.
men with both roots and wings
at a certain time we are one
"our litlle tricks, our innocence stubborn"
"men with just little wings, men with just little minds"
"men with just little eyes, men with just little deeds"
sleeping between the storm that was
and the wind which fails to come [(and finally)]
blow us away.
too many cuts and too many broken bones
"draining the life, burying skeletons"
"do or die, this is the feeling i'm craving"
waiting for life to ignite
this is the moment for taking
"a leap of faith, i'll"
"jump into the fire, no fear, i'll"
take you the edge but it still can't break me
i'm not caving in!
"the ring of the bells, feeling you resonate"
"into the night, hearing you fade away"
"do or die, this is a choice that i'm making"
and it feels like i'm living a lie
this is the moment for taking
"a leap of faith, i'll"
"jump into the fire, no fear, i'll"
take you the edge but it still can't break me
i'm not caving in!
"nothing's gonna kill me, come take me"
closer to the edge but it still can't break me
i'm not caving in!
"so fill your lungs, inhale the future"
that's screaming out
"so fill your lungs, inhale the future"
that's screaming out
release the pressure!
"so fill your lungs, inhale the future"
that's screaming out
release the pressure!
"so fill your lungs, inhale the future"
that's screaming out
"jump into the fire, no fear, i'll"
take you the edge but it still can't break me
i'm not caving in!
"nothing's gonna kill me, come take me"
closer to the edge but it still can't break me
i'm not caving in!
(jump into the fire)
(jump into the fire)
i'm not caving in!
too many cuts and too many broken bones
"pain, makes me stronger"
everyday
life is chaos
you gotta deal with it
expressing my agressions
through confusion
face reality
nothing is like it used to be
don't tell me i don't know
you don't live in my war
revolt and anger
i won't take it anymore
don't get me wrong
you don't know where i'm from
don't get me wrong
you don't know where i've been
don't get me wrong
it's been a painful way
don't get me wrong
you wouldn't understand

crave the machine
revere the screen
zoom in for flak and misery
bleed some pixels
shoot yourself
pose for the dead
have a near-life experience
in a hot air matrix
now you're a star
vain avatar
feeding the beast
in your loud egoland
you have become
tool of a tool
digital ghouls
telling you to
shut up and dance!
color a yarn and the crowds will gather
noise
from a sunless world
"your mirror is black, only a copy stares back"
at a slave of brave new world
noise
to decoy the human voice
"brain insomniac, paranoiac"
endless noise
please love me
see how i bleed
please endure
i have such empathy in me
"hum, noise, hum"
beautifully numb
tapping the quiet air
to have a meaning
by a carrion
sad hologram
lost in the maze
the real and human feel
sunset is free
from this deity
the earth has a real voice
go out and get in
(i will follow)
color a yarn and the crowds will gather
noise
from a sunless world
"your mirror is black, only a copy stares back"
at a slave of brave new world
noise
to decoy the human voice
"brain insomniac, paranoiac"
endless noise
feast your eyes on the black mirror
"feed the beast, join the gathering, tell a tale"
feast of fears is drawing nearer
feast your eyes on the black mirror
"feed the beast, join the gathering, tell a tale"
feast of fears is drawing nearer
beyond the human horizon
something terrifying sleeps
noise
from a sunless world
"your mirror is black, only a copy stares back"
at a slave of brave new world
noise
to decoy the human voice
"brain insomniac, paranoiac"
endless noise
endless noise
endless noise
wakin' up on monday morning
sunday'd been and gone
reachin' out for you
but i was alone
now i sit at the breakfast table
table's set for two
been the same thing ev'ry mornin'
silly things i do
"ooh, don't know what to do about you"
i'll never could give the way you gave
"ooh, now should i try to find you"
keep playin' ev'ry song you played me
feel like breakin' up again
it's a thing i gotta live with
take it on my own
i'm waitin' till it's over
then again i never know
if i'd only seen you goin'
walkin' out the door
but i had no way of knowin'
can't take it no more
"ooh, don't know what to do about you"
i'll never could give the way you gave
"ooh, now should i try to find you"
keep playin' ev'ry song you played me
feel like breakin' up again
the ascension of human intelligence
to atomic genocide
homo sapience
"the disease, the cause, the pollution"
erase the aeons of evolution
"pushed too far, just a matter of time"
seemingly nothing to hold the tide...
...except the end...accept the end?
the stars above shine down below
the fever you hold on this night
deathly cold
i can feel from this side of the door
i can feel eleanor
"he said, sun dont rise..."
he said sun dont shine
he said dont bring tomorrow
to justify tonight
the moon is full-the stars are bright
and the sky is a poisonous garden
tonight.
sip your tequila. give me some time
to unlearn all ive learned for the
spring to unwind
and then came your sweet mouth
i began to move mine.
they knew with the dawn-
they knew with the day
they knew what they had
would be young naked prey
and attacked from all sides
by a world filled with
poison and hate
eleanor trembles. eleanor moans.
"somehow, this body is someone"
she always has known
she cries tears on his chest
o so silent and slow-
she said please dont go. please dont go-
and she cried and she died in his arms
and he cried nevermore
"the moon is full, the stars are bright"
and the sky is a poisonous garden
tonight.
i am after you
a shadow on the hunt
don't turn around
i am right behind you
i will get to you
and take you down
tear your insides out
crush your soul
i am out for blood
out for your blood
i am harder than steel
break your will
waiting all my life
to kill
i will get to you
and take you down
tear your insides out
crush your soul
i am out for blood
out for your blood
i can smell your flesh
i can taste your sweat
i can sense your fear
i am right here
[lead - michael amott]
[lead - christopher]
i am out for blood
out for your blood
out for blood (x3)
out for blood (x3)

called back in time by the ancient winds
can't you recall all the memories?
walking the lost way of those who lived
in loneliness
think of the joy and the endless days
one step aside and the skies were grey
is this a life or just a game to lose or win?
cause a day will turn into night
and the spirits will rise
there will come then a time to understand...
deep inside
blessed by the rain falling from above
could you imagine where life would take you
now that you're praying for everyone you hurt so bad?
"still, don't you go, got to make a choice"
"crying in silence, crying with no voice"
dare you to stay now and keep your strength
up till the end?...
cause a day will turn into night
and the spirits will rise
"hold your breath, keep your eyes wide open"
now you see: the night is so clear
and you feel: the spirits are here
"running free, running free without fear,"
you'll find a way
to the brightest light...
and now
"here i am, open arms"
thought your life was over when
there you saw in the sky
"a ray of light,"
so here i am
will the stars keep shining bright
till one day they may ignite?
"when you gaze at the sky above,"
i'll ever come down
to ease your solitude...
and now
"here i am, open arms"
thought your life was over when
there you saw in the sky
"a ray of light,"
so here i am
there you saw in the sky
a ray of light
always by your side
there will come a time to understand...!
"approaching a silence, a blur of subsidence"
"time may heal all troubles, is that what i've found?"
"joy entices all, until death's lonely shroud"
but i know it's forever:
praying for a change
"our lives leading onwards, the essence is stronger"
memories of life drifting further away
i must doubt that where
there's a will there's a way:
but i know it's forever
life is all the pain we endeavor
unleash the beast you used to be
"let go off, and set it free"
"relieve your heart, let it breathe"
forget the place you used to know
get ready for a miracle
straightening the curve of the road
"from this time, from this day"
you'll never be the same
leave behind what's insane
and let it fade away
you can still count on me
"from the past, nothing remains"
it's light-years away
when you just listen to the words
from someone who wants to take hold
"of your will, of your thoughts,"
of your mind and soul
people who've lost their own life
normally try to get by
"inside your world, to lead you on,"
they cherish when you fall...
fear in my subconscious
terror invades my speech
faith in my own words
no one knows the nameless
warm winds and burning tears
spirits outside bodies
endless repression by majority
a master without command
strange new dimension disturbing my brain
"censored ideas, counterfeit answers"
"shining blast, no perception"
"altered state, no reaction"
shining blast
altered state
"slow talk, fast thoughts"
ancient scriptures
controversial lines
knowledge changes
running in the wrong direction
crossing with blind eyes
i'm closer to myself
sanity can't invade
where hath the apostles gone?
joining hands with wicked ones
"revelation has come to pass, new world order"
will hold the mass
a book written by the man
used to control and command
"all rights will be denied,"
without the mark you shall die
"no confession, all is known, all is known"
"new world order, you shall be shown shall be shown"
monitoring all wages
new world order comes in stages
currency is obsolete
feel the agony of defeat
"symbol of society today,"
a must have or you shall pay
as humans flesh leads the mind
just as a pawn the last martyr dies
"no confession, all is known, all is known"
"new world order, you shall be shown shall be shown"
where hath the apostles gone?
joining hands with wicked ones
"revelation has come to pass, new world order,"
will hold the mass
through eerie reach of ancient woods
where lumbering mists arise
i journey for nines moons of the year
to where a land of legend lies
deep within a stony lamp-lit hall
under falling grains of sand
magic eyes glance magic pages
turned by magic hands
and as he spoke i watched in awe
a god's aura in his eyes
master of all
darkness fall - spirits arise
lord of storms - blacken the skies
"with heavy breath, i break the seal"
howls echo through the room
blood lettings of a black raven's heart
conjure up the wraiths of doom
i cannot heed my master's call
lakes of fire - writhe and swell
foolish eyes - while spying prophet's pages
unleash barons of hell
and as they rose i watched in awe
a god's aura in my eyes
master of all
darkness fall - spirits arise
lord of storms - blacken the skies
"now that the time has passed,"
we look back in angst at the past
"now that the dust has cleared,"
the ugly head of fear has reared
was there ever a guiding truth -
a light to silence the cries?
suspicion is building a case to coutner-attack the lies
"now that time has moved on,"
can we look to the future with hope?
"now that the dawn has returned,"
forget not the sense of pain
is the world still a masquerade - a deja vu of trauma?
hidden plans and corrupt ideals
molest the true spirit to live
we cannot fight what we cannot see
larceny of the heart
we can't take back
what we didn't know was taken
larceny of the heart
"now that the time has passed,"
we look back in angst at the past
"now that the dust has cleared,"
the ugly head of fear has reared
"now that time has moved on,"
can we look to the future with hope?
"now that the dawn has returned,"
forget not the sense of pain
we cannot fight what we cannot see
"larceny of the heart, we can't take back"
what we didn't know was taken
larceny of the heart
stripped to the nerve we obey
a shadow empire lies in wait
stripped to the nerve we obey
the pounding pulse of deceit
we cannot fight what we cannot see
larceny of the heart
we can't take back
what we didn't know was taken
larceny of the heart
out on the street i'm stalking the night
i can hear my heavy breathing
paid for the kill but it doesn't seem right
something there i can't believe in
voices are calling from inside my head
i can hear them i can hear them
vanishing memories of things that were said
they can't try to hurt me now
but a shot in the dark one step
away from you
a shot in the dark alawys
creeping up on you
taught by the powers that preach over me
i can hear their empty reason
i wouldn't listen i learned how to fight
i opened up my mind to treason
but just like the wounded and when it's too late
they'll remember they'll surrender
never a care for that people who hate
underestimate me now
but a shot in the dark one step
away from you
a shot in the dark not a thing
that you can do
a shot in the dark always
creeping up on you
but just like the wounded and when it's too late
they'll remember they'll surrender
never a care for the people who hate
underestimate me now
but a shot in the dark one step
away from you
a shot in the dark not a thing
that you can do
a shot in the dark always
creeping up on you
i washed my hands today
won't follow you this time my friend
i beg you to stay away
the bloodstains won't come out
the color red won't leave my skin
i must be free
i won't hear no more
i won't see anymore
i won't be a part of anything your evil mind creates
i won't take no more
i won't think no more
you can keep your lies all to yourself
i know just what you are
this time you've gone too far
it's getting hard to breathe
i'm choking on the memories
you're not where i want to be
i'm picking up the pieces of my life
so say no more
just say goodbye
i won't hear no more
i won't see anymore
i won't be a part of anything your evil mind creates
i won't take no more
i won't think no more
you can keep your lies all to yourself
i know just what you are
this time you've gone too far
this time you've gone too far
you've gone too far...
i won't hear no more
i won't see anymore
i won't be a part of anything your evil mind creates
i won't take no more
i won't think no more
you can keep your lies all to yourself
i know just what you are
i won't hear no more
i won't see anymore
i won't be a part of anything your evil mind creates
i won't take no more
i won't think no more
you can keep your lies all to yourself
i know just what you are
this time you've gone too far
questioning the future with flaming intent
i kneel before the temples of ice
"crystalised walls rise to 10,000 feet"
behind lies th answers to life
"my cold breathless pain, makes me hunger for fire"
"must forge on, must remain and fulfil my desire"
inside temples of
"running the tunnels, the icy walls scaled"
i strech for the welfare of heat
staring through clouds of my own fog-soaked breath
the challenge that i must defeat
"my heart sinks in fear, as i seek but can't tell"
"i feel death drawing near, as i reach into hell"
"here, in temples of ice"
"here now, in my mind's easy"
"lost my sight, my soul i find decaying into dust"
ice - temples of
ice - temples of
weak and sick i crawl
in the dust of past mistakes
leaving for the darkness
of tears and cold heartaches
suffer in this grief
of forever burning hate
the ashes of my life
by the torment you create
on my knees... remembering
the wasted years of dark insanity
the rage increases fast
as the memories eat me alive
"god, i wish this to end"
but i'm not prepared to die
no more a human being
just a fool of anxiety
unable to escape
the darkest insanity
psychosomatic - defiance across
psychosomatic - lunacy unborn
psychosomatic - psycopathic thread
psychosomatic - left for dead
psychosomatic - mentally insane
psychosomatic - totally deranged
psychosomatic - live in the now
psychosomatic - to kill 'em all...
behold the prophets would come
beyond and from beyond...
"behold, no sanctuary, no..."
i am psychosomatic now...
psychosomatic - cause and effect

psychosomatic...
no sanctuary
psychosomatic...
no sanctuary
bury the priest and burn religion alive
baptized at birth with the black brush's wine
the uncrowned king unholy
forget about the crucifix
my rising sign is 666
can't you see the way they twist and turn
you watch it burn
just sign right here and watch the tables turn
you want the world
i'll show the way
just raise your fist and let me hear you say
"hate! you want it, say"
"hate! you need it, say"
hate! you want it
"come on, come on, come on, come on"
"get it, get it, go"
incarnation can bring down the stars
"five-thousand times, and their service is ours"
"obscene, unclean, unholy"
"the losers, dope-fiends, and don't forget"
"the worthless, no good, piece of shit"
come with me and we'll drink a toast to anarchy
all we need is excess and ecstasy
you want the world
i know the way
just raise your fist and let me hear you say
"hate! you want it, say"
"hate! you need it, say"
hate! you want it
"come on, come on, come on, come on"
"get it, get it,"
"hate! you want it, say"
"hate! you need it, say"
hate! you want it
"come on, come on, come on, come on"
"get it, get it, go"
and you its plain to see
in our society
all of us will bleed
but your war is not with me
there are many of those who oppose us (x3)
oppose us (x2)
all of this could always be the way
that you would want it to
"come on, sell your soul"
it's what you want to do
this could be the only way
forget the fucking judgment day
"ignorant is bliss, so raise your fist and say"
"hate! you want it, say"
"hate! you need it, say"
hate! you want it
"come on, come on, come on, come on"
"get it, get it,"
"hate! you want it, say"
"hate! you need it, say"
hate! you want it
"come on, come on, come on, come on"
"get it, get it, go (x3)"
"come on, come on, come on, come on"
"get it, get it, go"
sometimes i forget to see
now that i’ve found you
"what is, and what will never be"
now that i’ve found you
when my time has gone away
the words i say
their lies will help you through
and i fell like it’s gonna rain
a real rain
to wash this from you too
so addicted to the pain
and it’s the pain that makes you crazy
your mind is closing in
on a fight that you can’t win
it’s making me insane
"if you crawl, i’ll follow, i’ll follow"
don’t walk away
"if you fall, i’ll follow"
don’t walk away
i think of the things that just got lost
now that you found me
as if i just had shuffled off
now that you found me
when my time had gone away
the actions played
they broke your world in two
and i feel like it’s gonna rain
a real rain
to wash this from me too
crawling
what is and what will never be
and it’s the pain that makes you crazy
i tell you jesus christ was just an ordinary man
"but he was wise, much wiser than the rest"
the few to see wrote tales 'bout him but time perverted
it all
"the banner's changed, the world ain't changed at all"
forced to fight for law and order
in the name of god to slaughter
living in this world could be a life in hell
"they're around everywhere, can't you tell?"
echoes of evil
"you know, they don't know what it is when they talk"
'bout the law
the rights are wrong when only riches rule
you hear them say we're civilized but still blacks are
slaves
when money talks they won't hear all the cries
forced to fight with law and order
in the name of god to slaughter
"dying at the front is tradition, you know"
just like fathers and grandfathers did
echoes of evil
we're men - we're bound to fail but we can learn it
the ones who never face it will stay blind
we gained too much by science but we can't use it
prepare your mind to stop before it's to late
the preacher's done the rites of christ for a thousand
years or more
believes in personified gods
does he fear waking up to see it's not so easy
opposing good 'n' bad as he did?
forced to fight with law and order
in the name of god to slaughter
what is religion - shit in your brain
a blade of straw in oceans of life
"don't follow leaders, no matter what side"
though it's harder to live your ideals
remember me
remind me the last time
remember peace
and when the tides were low
but now you're gone
im lost by the wayside
it's been so long
i can't but fight to breathe
is that you in my head?
have you woke from the dead?
or is it loneliness?
its all i see
the light of a past life
alone to bleed
i am without release
you set me free
to wander the shoreline
or is it me?
too proud to speak the need
where is the fire you gave me?
all of the weight to remind me
of all that we were
how long 'til i turn?
is that you in my head?
have you woke from the dead?
or is it loneliness?
is that you in my head?
have you woke from the dead?
or is it loneliness?
is that you in my head?
have you woke from the dead?
or is it loneliness?
is that you in my head?
have you woke from the dead?
or is it loneliness?
is that you in my head?
have you woke from the dead?
or is it loneliness?
can you see the storm getting closer now?
tell me how it feels being out there
a moment's glimpse of his vignette
as he shone a light on the falling wall
instant pictures form shattered persons
whenever he leaves there's a tainted mark
flashbacks of his stark sleep filter out through smoke
revoking from the past things less provoked
"any which day, there is no relief"
"adhesive words, spoken silently"
the shattered man
can you see the storm getting closer now?
tell me how it feels being out there
"i want to stay with you, and i see it clear now"
you are giving me no choice
let the rain pour down
he's holding for the moment of the fall
stolen knowledge by minds unformed
regulate the demolition of annexe for the differing thoughts
discarded sparks left years ago
evoked a language much more austere
reverberating with figments
he left a trace of translucence
shattered man
there's a shattered man in a shattered land
"woke up, didn't choke up"
"saw my ak, it was broke up"
put it together like a jigsaw
got my 9 and my rambo knife off the floor
went to the bathroom and beat the rush
"""yo who the fuck used my toothbrush?"""
"went to my sisters room, ""yo bitch wake up"""
"""you stupid ass, dirty ass nasty ass slut."""
"shot her in the leg, shot her in the thigh,"
"kicked her in the pussy, and punched her in the eye"
"slapped her in the head, stepped on her cord,"
don't fuck around bitch word is bond.
went downstairs to eat with my folks
"""ma...you broke the fuckin egg yolk"""
"punched her in the chest, got on her cheek"
then i made her scream like the bitch was a thief
"knee to the pussy, kick to the skull"
ak yo i shot the bitch in the temple
pops' got mad cuz mom got licked
i didn't give a fuck so i shot 'em in the dick
"hungry ass fuck, said my grace"
pop kept screamin' so i shot him in the face
ate my food found my coat
mail man came so i cut his mutha-fuckin' throat
waiting for the mutha-fuckin' school bus...
i had a dream that i was hard...
blücher
dim is the light of a war day
in the land of the undying sun
hollow the silence around me
distant the sound of a gun
port side is close to the shore
i wonder where she is
incoming shot cross the bow
will she remember me
vail my april moon
god forsaken soul
i remember you
come with me tonight
damned is the dawn of a war day
revelations of dead and despair
frost misty waters around me
frantic and naked the fear
port side is close to the shore
incoming shot cross the bow
say your prayers
loud and clearly
all who still believe in god
i've had a dream about forgiveness
but i hear the angel sing
the emotions were right
a magical mind like a wonder
a precious heart can be broken
within one night
then i realized
she's a devil in disguise
how can i turn back the time?
when angels cause you nightmares
you can't fight them off
their spell keeps you under control
when angels cause you nightmares
and they fall from the skies
destroying your life and your soul
in a moment of weakness
we nearly cheated
expecting too much from life
pretend to be someone
not a monster screaming to the night
will i remember
the magical moments and tears
when she pretended
angel disappeared
"angels and liars, make me hide"
"angels and liars, how i've tried"
"hope or desire, what lifts me higher?"
devouring fire
when angels cause you nightmares
you can't fight them off
their spell keeps you under control
when angels cause you nightmares
and they fall from the skies
destroying your life and your soul
when angels 'cause you nightmares
when angels 'cause you nightmares
i've had a dream about forgiveness
men is not alone in this world and
mankind is not completely absurd
breaking men ground to build and to grow
advancing their lives for better or worse
in a world growing fast we're losing touch
cultivating hate and forging rules
closing our eyes we search the sky
expectations are from religion
what went wrong
i don't believe you
it's been around for thousands of years at least
there's nothing new with another catastrophe
a sense to move on is filling the air
what went wrong
i don't believe you
what went wrong
i don't believe you
men is not alone in this world and
mankind is not completely absurd
breaking men ground to build and to grow
kashmir - colombia - rio - new york
old wars revived to revenge a lost
taking what's left and burning it down
creating oposition
what went wrong
i don't believe you
what went wrong
i don't believe you
in the creation of anu were spawned
born of the earth before the age of god
"with word unwrit, nowhere they're known"
evade destruction in their world below
their hands reach for our place outside
bestow their suffering on human life
nothing will stop them from re-entering
return to hatred in the heart of man
they are the children of the underworld
before the heavens they were on the earth
to desolation and were never heard
"""cry rebirth"""
"lords of the plague, seven are they"
born in the mountain of mashu's magic
"spirits of hate, they have no name"
"withered and wicked, the liars in wait"
in the creation of anu were spawned
with deadly vengeance from the ancient gods
"their place on earth, their race unknown"
beyond the knowledge of the elder ones
provoking with our blood to rise
the seven offspring for the sacrifice
reclaim the power of the crown of death
enter the body from the temple dead
every single time i feel the burn i try to throw it away.
a fast fix for the brokenness of everyday.
"its like the pain is building up, it's swelling up,"
i've got to choke it down and break it down until it's broke down.
"it's like a shard of glass, it's like a broken piece."
"of everything i hate, it's everything in me,"
a burnt heart stains black the blood it flows.
a dead soul will overshadow.
"push it out. i'ts everything you never were,"
push it out. i want to see it shatter.
and everyday i see my life rewind tearing through dreams i find im wide awake.
"and even when it's wrong i start to learn, and then i do it again."
"i reach out to grasp and get a broken hand,"
and everyone is going to turn their backs.
"i want to take them down,"
and strike them down and leave them struck down.
its like im made to fail with everything i gain.
just an infected piece in a defective game.
my two hands give birth to nothing right.
a black past is an effective foresight.
"push it out, it's everything you never were."
"push it out, i want to see it shatter."
and everyday i see my life rewind tearing through dreams i find im wide awake.
"and everything is building up, a pale heart is an empty cup,"
"if nothing ever changes, im breaking down, giving up."
"burn it out, let it go, break it all, lose control,"
"force it out, bring it through, pass it down, make it new."
"kill the pain, scrape it off, leave it here, make it stop."
"tear it down, bleed it out, all the hate, see it straight."
no one ever told me that it would all stay the same.
everyday i fall on shards of my hatred and shame.
the sun is shining off his face again
"another day to reflect, i hope you understand"
looking for the sign that's let's me know
that you're fine
that you finally just found your way back home
"feel you within, feel you everywhere"
"you'll path the sky, will get me everywhere"
"so take me some place, where i will always know"
that you're fine
"that you finally just, found your way back home"
"who's to tell me, i have to let it go"
"i need to say this, have to let you know"
i will be here waiting for our souls to meet
i will be here waiting for your call to me
"anthony, i know you're home"
"right beside me, all alone"
"anthony, i have so much to say"
"in my heart, you will always remain"
i'll never be alone...
"maybe i'm blind, maybe i don't wanna see"
i distinct this fight won't play for me
"let us just think that i will, i think i know"
that you're fine
"that you finally just, found your way back home"
"i question my faith, i question everything"
i need to know if this is all there is
so take me someplace where i will always know
that you're fine
"that you finally just, found your way back home"
"who's to tell me, i have to let it go"
"i need to say this, have to let you know"
i will be here waiting for our souls to meet
i will be here waiting for your call to me
"anthony, i know you're home"
"right beside me, all alone"
"anthony, i have so much to say"
"in my heart, you will always remain"
"anthony, my brother, my friend"
i'll be with you once again
"anthony, my heart owns your faith"
it will always light your day
and never be alone..
and never be alone...
and never be alone....
and never be alone.....
"(dokken, lynch, pilson)"
"i, yeah, i'm leaving today"
sorry is not enough
like so many things
we were lost forever
i can't turn the hands of time
back to the way it was
i can only go on
to find a better road
i can't stop you now
my back's against the wall
there's only so many tears you can cry
there's only so many ways you can say goodbye
there's only so many tears you can cry
there's only so many ways you can say goodbye
so many tears you can cry
you had such a foolish heart
you thought it would last forever
but you were the one
that brought it to an end
now i'm standing in the rain
'cause i wasn't there for you
such a fool was i
it should have never been
i couldn't stop you now
my back's against the wall
there's only so many tears you can cry
there's only so many ways you can say goodbye
there's only so many tears you can cry
there's only so many ways you can say goodbye
so many tears
so many tears
only so many tears you can cry
you can't change the world
place the blame on me
life goes on without you
there's nothing left for me
i can't change the world
place the blame on me
life goes on without you
and now at last i see
there's only so many tears you can cry
there's only so many ways you can say goodbye
only so many tears you can cry
there's only so many ways you can say goodbye
i can't take anymore
so mnay tears
life goes on without you
so many tears
there's nothing left for me
so many tears
and now we're lost forever
so many tears
bass!
how low can you go?
"death row, what a brother knows"
once again back is the incredible
the rhyme animal
"the young* cannibal*, d, public enemy, number one"
"""five-o"" said, ""freeze!"" and i got numb"
can i tell 'em that i really never had a gun
but it's the wax that the terminator x spun
"now they got me in a cell 'cause my records, they sell"
"cause a brother like me said, ""well..."
...farrakahn's a prophet and i think you ought to listen to
"what he can say to you, what you ought to do"""
"follow for now, power of the people, say,"
"black is back, all in, we're gonna win"
"check it out, yeah y'all c'mon, here we go again"
turn it up! bring the noise
never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
at the fact that's corrupt like* a senator
"soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope"
cause the beats in the lines are so dope
listen for lessons i'm saying inside music
that the critics are blasting me for
they'll never care for the brothers and sisters now across
the country has us up for the war
"we got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait,"
'till we get it right
radio stations i question their blackness
"they call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this"
"turn it up, bring the noise"
"get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me"
"my deejay is warm, he's x, i call him norm ya know"
he can cut a record from side to side
"so what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide"
"soul control, beat is the father of your rock 'n' roll"
"music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band man"
"makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know"
"you call'em demos, but we ride limos too"
whatcha gonna do? rap is not afraid of you
"beat is for sonny bono, beat is for yoko ono"
run-dmc first said a deejay could be a band
"stand on it's own feet, get you out your seat"
"beat is for eric b and l. l. as well, hell"
"wax is for anthrax, still i can rock bells ever"
"forever, universal it will sell"
"time for me to exit, terminator x-it"
"turn it up, bring the noise"

"rock with some pizzazz, it will last, why you ask?"
"roll with the rock stars, you'll never get accepted as"
"we got to plead the fifth, we can investigate"
"don't need to wait, get the record straight"
"hey, posse's in effect, got flavor, terminator"
"x to sign checks, play to get paid"
we got to check it out down on the avenue
a magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
"yeah, i'm telling you..."
hi - welcome to hell
you are all here
for this where you must dwell
sinners and cheats
sit here with satan
and have all your spirits meet
oh city beneath the surface above
how you survive on evil and blood
you breathers in this space
you never can leave this place
die - we all must die
how will you face it
when you bend to your knees and cry
burn - like witches burn
when will you sinners believe
that it's your time to learn?
oh city beneath the surface above
how you survive on evil and blood
you breathers in this space
you never can leave this place
you breathers in this space
you never can leave this place
punished for the way that you lived
raping and stealing
but never one thought to give
here forever - not a trail or a trace
total illusions of tales
disease spreading death
entire population dies
dead before you're born
massive suicide
vicious game of fear
it's all extermination now
poison in your veins
global genocide
slaughter governs law
the apocalypse begins
pain becomes the norm
seeking homicide
beware the coming storm
that starts illuminating fires
god is laughing hard
man has gone insane
world painted blood
no sanctuary
world painted blood
no sanctuary
tip the human scale
follow revelations plan
it must come to pass
secret shadows lie
blue print haunting dreams
in which manipulation wins
speak no hidden fears
religion neutralized
emerged from the dark
sadist mercenary ride
realm of this world
godless messengers
"sickless, mindless hate"
becoming evolution's cure
planets usher in alignment
god has died
world painted blood
no sanctuary
world painted blood
no sanctuary
"god send death, watch it bleed, justified"
manufactured lives born in hell
"angels fall, wings on fire, crucified"
"terrorizing man, burn the world"
"reflecting eyes, sickle swings, wave of blood"
suicidal mind from the start
"endless pain, open wounds, slit the throat"
radiation child seeks the throne
strafing down demigods certain death
"coming from the stars, lord of all"
"dark rift rise, flourish life, perish man"
"we destroy ourselves, cease to live"
children's blood feed the dead sea of flesh
catastrophic fall rest in hell
"flaming corpse, screaming eyes, watch it die"
"walk among the dead, pick your grave"
[x4]
like a disease spreading death
erasing your existence
satan's hand begins the end
and frees the world forever
gomorrah's dream to live in sin
has reached its critical mass
man himself has become god
and laughs at his destruction
in which we trust a secret government
is now in total collapse
disease spreading death
entire population dies
dead before you're born
massive suicide
vicious game of fear
it's all extermination now
poison in your veins
global genocide
slaughter governs law
the apocalypse begins
pain becomes the norm
seeking homicide
beware the coming storm
that starts illuminating fires
god is laughing hard
man has gone insane

welcoming our death
"the weekend comes, i'm gonna see my baby,"
i close the door and leave everything behind.
"i hit the road, the sun is shining down so brightly,"
five more miles and i'm lying in her arms.
"now her motions turn me on, and i'm gonna sing my"
song.
"free time is one of the things that i love,"
free time is one of the things i enjoy.
"the sun goes down, we're gonna see a movie."
how happy life could be without any work.
"there ain't no doubt we're gonna have a party,"
"'til monday morning, noone can disturb."
"now your motions turn me on, and we're gonna sing our song."
"free time is one of the things that i love,"
free time is one of the things i enjoy.
free time - - - we want more
my mind is darkened by a demon in my soul
my life is empty and my heart is getting cold
my hope is dying by things i used to see
so much confusion - i'm down on my knees
to find a solution - i want to break free
look through the eyes of time and finally you will see
the broken dreams and all the pain and tragedy
"my mind is asking, will i ever find the key?"
so much confusion - i'm down on my knees
to find a solution - i want to break free
"here comes the rain again, falling on my head"
"my mind is dark again, it's gonna make me mad"
"here comes the rain again, crawling like a snake"
"it's like a thunderstorm, i can not escape"
"possession, possessed"
and when the curtain falls they still don't realize
"who cries for children, when there's no one left to cry?"
"who's proud of victories, when all the love has died?"
so much confusion - i'm down on my knees
to find a solution - i want to break free
"here comes the rain again, falling on my head"
"it's like a thunderstorm, it's gonna make me mad"
"here comes the rain again, crawling like a snake"
"here comes the rain again, i can not, i can not escape"
"i try, but it's so hard to find"
wiping the tears of my mind
i cried for the pain deep inside
where is my blue sunny sky?
... and where the fuck is my superman outfit???
so much confusion - i'm down on my knees
to find a solution - i want to break free
"here comes the rain again, falling on my head"
"my mind is dark again, it's gonna make me mad"
"here comes the rain again, no more, no more"
"it will not bring me down, no more, no more"
so let me dry the tears and then i will arise
out in the sunlight see me fly
see me fly
yeah
float away
known so low
you run away
desolate us
desolate all
no love is lost
you know we're weightless
climb
under my wing
climb
known so low
you run away
desolate us
desolate all
no love is lost
you know we're weightless
climb
under my wing
climb
known so low
you run away
desolate us
desolate all
grown so slow
you run away
desolate us
i'm sailing away
i'm at the darkest side of life
i've crossed the demons paradise
i've seen the fallen angels eyes
some call this state insanity
it's just as dark as it can be
there's no way out i won't be free
can someone hear my call?
come and help me through it all
can you ease the pain?
so my life won't be in vein
i'm heading to the stars
but the road won't lead no longer
up to the sunrise it won't heal
the liberty seems far away
can't find the way
the vision won't be clearer
i see blood on my hands
no more footprints in the sand
diabolus
all through my life is close to hell
"i know my crime, i know it well"
there's no regret for me to tell
i'm lost inside my misery
i've prayed to god to set me free
but there's a darker voice inside of me
can someone hear my call?
come and help me through it all
can you ease the pain?
so my life won't be in vein
i'm heading to the stars
but the road won't lead no longer
up to the sunrise it won't heal
the liberty seems far away
can't find the way
the vision won't be clearer
i see blood on my hands
no more footprints in the sand
diabolus
unleash me from my chains - who am i?
i'm a slave under my own failures
i'm a sinner that lives in a lie
i've been down to the deepest valley
who am i? - help me!
unleash me from these chains
release me from this pain
i'm lost in misery
oh god please set me free
savage
you hear the people talking you walk the wrong street
painting all things black and step on your feet
"flabby stomach, styled hair, trousers full of air"
their morality is real ours isn't there
"they don't know, no they can't see"
our hearts close to the sun
different in our hearts filled with
that faith we carry on
they just call us savage
that's what i like to be
let them call us savage
cause that's what we like to be
see the people wonder we run in our direction
let the narrow-minded sleep we better do some action
i'm trying to be the winner not the sacrifice
see them run they know no fun
and look what they have done
in this world full of rules
we look just like fools
i know what they think when i see them lookin' at me
(savage)
we come close every day to the time table life
so mart they start their backwards fight
i know what they think when i see them lookin' at me
(savage)
one day they will drop the bomb
cause it's necessary to show the power
one day they will give a shit on what you say
walking in the subway
alone late at night
new york city gangs
everywhere in sight
you feel their anger upon you
you feel their hateful eyes
walk a little faster now
you're fighting for your life
as they walk on closer
their eyes burn down your back
you feel a thousand cries
not prepared for their attack
a mission bell sent sign
it's a sign that you board soon
"you've come this far, no turning back"
we hope you make it too
"don't expect, sympathy"
"we don't know, the word"
"you walked my turf, insanity"
but in this place you die
your life is wasted
your blood is tasted
as it drips down the blade
you didn't make it
you couldn't take it
you walked the subway you paid
your money's gone
your clothes they're torn
you're lying in a pool of blood
you know you're leaving
we watch you grieving
but in this place you die
don't expect sympathy
we don't know the word
"you walked my turf, insanity"
but in this place you die
overdraft and nsf
when i sign my name
all in the line of duty
when playing in the game
"a piece of the pie, cut of the take"
nothing left for me
keep your eye on the money
livin ain't for free
i wanna know
where does all the money go?
i wanna know
where does all the money go?
bankrupt and out of cash
never pay bills on time
interest and mortgage rates
are always on the climb
income tax and revenue
are something to evade
no need to worry
when you got it made
administrative aggravation
monetary deprivation
all in all the situation's hopeless
contractual reciprocation
financial evaluation
after all negotiations
i wanna know
where does all the money go?
repossess your furniture
foreclosure on your loan
no way to call for help
when the disconnect your phone
bouncing cheques and credit cards
only time to borrow
living on a shoe string
where will i be tomorrow?
where does it go?!
everytime i speak
wipe away all these tears
living every day in fear
finding nothing but empty
(chosu) wide awake and dreaming
is this what it seems?
close my eyes forever
i'll wake up
desperation strips me
these last days have not been free
stealing every breath from me
whispering defeat
and i see it in your eyes
long gone
and i feel it in your heart
long gone
and i see it in your eyes
"long gone, long gone"
i know i should have seen the writings
that everything about you is fake
how could i be in such denial?
that all you wanna do is make me hate
you build me up so you can
"cut me down, if you're"
trying to make me hate you... it's working
you may believe this is
"gonna make me better, if you're"
trying to make me hate you... it's working
each word you said my veins grew harder
i ignored the warnings in my face
my black heart is turning into stone
cause all you wanna do is make me hate
you are the only thing you
"want to talk about, if you're"
trying to make me hate you... it's working
you disagree till i don't mind
"and you don't matter, if you're"
trying to make me hate you... it's working
look out
tell me this is nothing
something's playing tricks
and it's chipping away
i kep swirling into trouble
disguised in the faces
they're flocking my way
calling me
i feel it coursing through the inside
and i can't get away
away inside
i feel it breathing and i realise
the worst is on it's way
it is always something
life keeps trhowing thingas that don't go my way
i'm damned aweful thoughts devour me
all familliar places i can't escape
calling me
i feel it coursing through the inside
and i can't get away
away inside
i feel it breathing and i realise
the worst is on it's way
it makes me sick
but i deal with it
set it all aside
look over it's on the rise
calling me
i feel it coursing through the inside
calling me
i feel it coursing through the inside
and i can't get away
away inside
i feel it breathing and i realise
the worst is on it's way
the worst is on it's way
the worst is on it's way
it makes me sick
but i deal with it
set it all aside
look over it's on the rise
scat
"got the gear, got the gas, got compression"
she's the one gonna lessen my load
i'll make her shine in a cold pure perfection
feel the gleam as i'm startin' to roll
pouring on the speedway heat
she is my concrete connection
i fly with a
i ride with a
i glide with a bolt in my heart
i'm alive gonna
power drive hit my
overdrive with this bolt in my heart
ain't no losin'
got my movin' and
my groovin' all the way now
i ain't lookin' for divine intervention
"turn the key, hit the gas, and i go"
my direction is cast to the concrete
i ain't going where the down boys go
moving to the asphalt beat
i am a motor mutation
"run away, run"
"run to stay, gonna"
make my way with this bolt in my heart
"parallel fire, i'm"
"speed for hire, been a"
road vampire
oh pablo give me some guitar
"accelerate, accumulate"
no time to give to vindicate
lubricate 'n desecrate
i'll make the air disintegrate
aggravate and decimate
a navigatin' heavy weight
pounding down hard cross the ground
i fly with a
i ride with a
i glide with a bolt in my heart
i lean with my
"bad machine, and i"
my morphine is this bolt in my heart
"gonna fly, gonna"
"get real high, least i"
least i'll try with a bolt in my heart
"runaway, run"
"run to stay, gonna"
make my way with this bolt in my heart
ain't no losin' got my movin' and my
groovin' all day now
i can't deny it gets me high
when i'm feelin' and i'm speeding
down the asphalt way now
with this bolt in my heart
fallen into oblivion
the last views inside my mind...
silver walls of the castle
risen proudly towards the sky
the rebellion fell
many brave ones went down
hung on black trees they are
blown by the four winds
iâ€™ve been waiting for years
growing stronger
"blazing weapons, eyes burn bright"
in the dark...as a king i shall return...
horns sing in the woods
hordes gather
ancient gods of war ride the sky
old kingdom will fall
like a moondust
reflecting down the valleys
so pure hungry for blood
the hearts of the dark ones
thunders strike...
dancing on the black mirrors
the bards of war and vengeance
came from forgotten realms
as a king i shall return
to proclaim my victory
return of ancient pride
laws of steel...
"leave the sleep and let the springtime talk,"
in tongues from the time before a man
listen to a daffodil tell her tale
"let the guest in, walk out, be the first to greet the morn"
the meadows of heaven await harvest
the cliffs unjump cold waters untouched
the elsewhere creatures yet unseen
finally your number came up
free fall awaits the brave
come
taste the wine
race the blind
they will guide you from the light
writing noughts till the end of time
come
surf the clouds
race the dark
it feeds from the runs undone
meet me where the cliffs greets the sea
the answer to the riddle before your eyes
is in dead leaves and fleeting skies
returning swans and sedulous mice
"writings on the gardens book,"
in the minute of a lover's look
building a sandcastle close to the shore
a house of cards from the worn out deck
"a home from the fellowship, poise and calm"
riding hard every shooting star
"come to life, open mind, have a laugh at the orthodox"
"come, drink deep let the dam of mind seep"
"travel with great élan, dance a jig at the funeral"
come!
when they met she was fifteen
like a black rose blooming wild
and she already knew
she was gonna die
"""what's tomorrow without you?"
"this is our last goodbye..."""
she got weaker every day
as the autumn leaves flew by
until one day she told him:
this is when i die
what was summer like for you?
she asked him with a smile
what's tomorrow without you?
he silently replied
she said:
i will always be with you
i'm the anchor of your sorrow
there's no end to what i'll do
cause i love you
i love you to death
but the sorrow went too deep
the mountain fell too steep
and the wounds would never heal
cause the pain of the loss
was more than he could feel
he said:
i will always be with you
by the anchor of my sorrow
all i know or ever knew
is i love you
i love you to death
"""what's tomorrow without you?"
"is this our last goodbye?"""
i will always be with you
i'm the anchor of your sorrow
there's no end to what i'll do
cause i love you...
it was just another night
she held me in
her arms so tight
we were dreaming with the
stars in our eyes
but i never realized
like the wild in a cage
waiting to be free
a bird on the ground
with a broken wing
you wanted to fly
you had to be free
but what about me?
it was just another day
you had so much to say
our love was still strong
but you had to be free
like the wild in a cage
waiting to be free
a bird on the ground
with a broken wing
you wanted to fly
you had to be free
but what about me?
now the sands of time
have buried the heartbreak
you walked in with the wind
uncovered the memories
you're holding your arms out to me
temptation is all i see
i have to be strong
you had to be free
cause it's all about me
like the wild in a cage
waiting to be free
a bird on the ground
with a broken wing
you wanted to fly
you had to be free
devil on the left
angel on the right
there's no mistake
who i'll be w/ tonight
over in the fore
lamb's head on my lap
days
pass like weeks w/o the sight
then comes the fury of the lullaby
then comes the fury of the lullaby
heartbeat in a hole
an eyeball loose and wild
dropping memories
out upon the open tiles
and over to the left
there sit the loveless ones
crying slowly and sucking on a gun
do you wear the mark
do you wear the mark
darling darling
do you wear the mark
steel and fire
spreading the holy word
dirty liars
the truth has never been heard
are you the own who think free
or do you share this mad insanity
to use a religion - increasing the terror
is much more that just a human error
what are they fighting for
they call it holy war
so many innocent have died
there's no democracy in the church of blood
there's no democracy
welcome to the church of blood
pray salvation
the promised paradise
violent nations
who kill and terrorize
sowing the seeds of discord
ready to kill in the name
of our lord
suicide victims setting their signs
burning the books and the tales
with their lives
what are they fighting for
they call it holy war
so many innocent have died
there's no democracy in the church of blood
there's no democracy
welcome to the church of blood
no democracy in the church of blood
there's no democracy
welcome to the church of blood
"oh lord, my god - consider all the words thy hands"
have made
"your son - you sent him to die,"
i scare can take it in
"that on the cross,"
my burden gladly bearing
he bled and died to save me
from my sin
i don't know
"well, there's no charge for the haircut"
and the bullets come free
"my uncle sam send a letter, said:"
he's got a mission for me
"now i'm a ranger, not a stranger"
and i live in saigon
we've got a team of special forces
and we deliver napalm
but if they tell you that i've lost my mind
baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
about the time this letter gets home
"i'd be gone, gone, yeah gone"
and if they tell you that i'm f.i.a.
think a little less about me each day
'cause if i ever get back
"i'll be shell shocked, whoa"
"shell shocked, yeah"
feels funny riding in my car
used to drive a tank and shoot a b.a.r.
i know i'm home
"but i feel gone,gone, yeah gone"
now it's over and the homeland's safe
got a purple heart to show the world i'm brave
the businessmen sat home
"well i got shell shocked, whoa"
"shell shocked, whoa"
shell shock
shell shock
shell shock
"a thousand miles away and a thousand years ago,"
there was a place still to remember.
"they lived in fear, saw shadows on the wall,"
"""kill the king"", they screamed with anger"
"we lived in danger, all of you and i,"
don't talk to strangers
in the dead of night.
"we lived in danger, all of you and i,"
don't talk to strangers
in the dead of night.
we saw the face of the queen that shined
so bright
her poisoned glory makes you deaf and blind.
"some could escape from the reign of rolling, heads,"
"some would imagine, that they'll be better off dead."
all the same take me away
we're dead to the world
the child gave thought to the poet's words
gave comfort to the fallen
"(heartfelt, lovelorn)"
"remaining, yet still uninvited"
those words scented my soul
"(lonely soul, ocean soul)"
it's not the monsters under your bed
it is the man next door
"that makes you fear, makes you cry,"
makes you cry for the child
all the wars are fought among those lonely men
"unarmed, unscarred"
i don't want to die a scarless man
a lonely soul
(tell me now what to do)
i studied silence to learn the music
i joined the sinful to regain innocence
"heaven queen, cover me"
in all that blue
"little boy, such precious joy"
is dead to the world
"heaven queen, carry me"
away from all pain
all the same take me away
we're dead to the world
"dead, silent, constant"
yet always changing
- my favorite view of this world
"as he died, he will return to die in me again"
"weaving the cloth, giving birth to the century child"
who gave his life not for the world but for me
innocence reborn once more
"""with whom shall i have this dialogue?"
"the mad, the noble, the wit?"
"the past lurks under layers of fog,"
evolution's hall is unlit
"thoughts and visions confuse,"
mental wounds start to grow
but the questions never reduce
"about the anonymous cosmic shadow"""
this demon keeps my conscious awake
"from sleep, rest and the calm"
disillusioned i rinse my ache
in the ocean's whispering psalm
"the ocean theory covers earth,"
but i seek what has entire control
what nature introduced the genesis birth?
known deities? i curse 'em all
i've set my sails for this odyssey
to locate its mystic exile
"a crusade through the mind's liberty,"
not a journey in nautical miles
a voyage in science and fate
to disrobe the acceleration from zero
"to dive into it and investigate,"
terrifies even the bravest hero
"in the corridors of time we're sons,"
entrapped in lonely spaces
but star dusted electrons
"are my kinsmen, just with odd faces"
"still fantasies unveil their sloids,"
when patience turns to fear
"to examine the darkest, coldest voids"
for the hiding engineer
but our past is still our present
if we can't the knowledge rift over-span
"an eternal transformation is what the matrix represents,"
like the child is father to the man
"""some hide their confusion behind a religious mask,"
"like puppet thespians in ""god's"" masquerade"
"'cause the blur grows for every time we ask,"
"what generates the spherical parade?"""
"[1] you say that we sold our soul to the devil, that we're out of control"
"your torture my brothers, torture my sisters, kill all friends"
"you say that we worship a god, like a cat, a devil in disguise"
"you execute my family, steal their breath, and burn them till death"
"i'm burning, i'm dying,"
"i'm burning, i'm dying,"
"oh lord, won't you help me"
"i'm burning, i'm dying,"
when i feel my end is near
when i feel the reaper's here
crackling fire i can hear
when i feel my end is near
when i feel the reaper's here
i watch the demons
dancing round my tears
[2] i'm innocent - it's not true i never prayed
we will all be treated the same way at doomsday
i curse pope and king - you won't make it another year
the last judgement will decide who was wrong or who was right
"[the story of the final battle between arthur and mordred. in the decisive struggle between the two men, arthur's lance pierced mordred's breast from beneath him, and mordred stabbed arthur in his breast with his sword. mordred died and percival brought the mortally wounded arthur to safety]"
finally their time has come
face to face on the battlefield
the king's here to judge the deceiver
"open wounds, no riot shield"
the seed of hate is bearing fruit
grapes of wrath of evil root
blood against blood
black against white
dark hanging clouds
time's running out
blood against blood
mingeling stream
fate will decide
who has die
war was their life
traces of pain
all for the reign
the final war
spirit of life
fading away
the final day
the final war
the final war
the king stabs the deceiver
his blood drips down the spear
warning all the power-hungry
the last thing he could do
with morgane crossing the sea
in avalon he may find his peace
all the years we joined our lives
we did never regret
our decisions and the way
that we kept our heads
when i needed you the most
in my hour of pain
i awoke the rudest way
my belief was in vain
"in you, as i tell you weren't there"
"didn't catch my fall, oh no"
now you've killed all i had
wrath is burning in my mind
why can't you take it back
"no excuses, no regrets"
you just broke my back
"no, you as i tell you weren't there"
"didn't catch my fall, oh no"
now you've killed all i had
she killed and smiled
she killed and smiled
"what a beautiful death you brought, my child"

cry with a smile
my heart is bleeding
bewildered i'm here alone
why is there pain in a beautiful moment?
"why do i feel so lost, so empty?"
cry with a smile
my heart is healing
from pain i knew that would come
why stay locked in a deeply sad moment?
"why do i feel so cold, so peaceful?"
take my heart and set it free
take my heart and give a time to heal
"i know, in my memories you live"
take my heart a little while
take it with you to the place you go
"i know, we will meet again someday"
cry with a smile
my heart was dreaming
of time i knew would come to an end
why do i cry about a beautiful memory?
"why do i feel so hurt, so lonely?"
take my heart and set it free
take my heart and give a time to heal
"i know, in my memories you live"
take my heart a little while
take it with you to the place you go
"i know, we will meet again someday"
part i : mirror mirror
mirror can you tell me
how to stay forever young
let me know the secret
i will hold my twisted tongue
please protect my beauty
velvet skin so pure and white
hear my name resounding
like a hymn at dead of night
once i struck a servant
she's a virgin free from sin
drops of blood caressed me
and refined my aging skin
could this be the answer
uncorrupted carmine red
voices keep resounding
in my dazed bewildered head
have i found myself eternity
someone has heard my prayers
now i'll become divine
have i found myself divinity
i'm no longer a slave
to the vicious hands of time
part ii : requiem for the innocent
"mother, can you hold me"
one more time again?
"whisper ""i still love you"" in my ear"
"mother, did you lie?"
would you tell me why?
there is something deeper that i fear
justify the malice i portray
daggers in the darkness find your way
when the moon is full and piercing bright
drench me with your innocence tonight
don't you want to die?
walk beside me evermore
don't you feel alive
like you've never felt before?
visions of the future
unprofound and blurred
i have passed the point of no return
justify the malice i portray
let me keep my beauty one more day
when the moon is full and piercing bright
drench me with your innocence tonight
don't you want to die?
walk beside me evermore
don't you feel alive
like you've never felt before?
don't you want to die?
"souls transcending, silver shine"
don't you feel alive?
your blood preserves my place in time
part iii : fall from grace
breathe in deep
smell these halls of hate
carve your name into these walls
before it is too late
cold and twisted
they resisted
what was i to do
all i ever wanted was
a fraction of the truth
walking in the shadows
of my blackened mind
lost inside this shallow
vanity of time
what if there's a god a hell and heaven
fire is the torment i must face
dying by the souls i have forsaken
no one's going to catch my fall from grace
(bleed on me)
watch me from your cage
as i rejoin my painful prime
(suffer and exhale)
you and i are relics
we provoke and we recline
walking in the shadows
of my blackened mind
angels crave my sorrow
sorrow they will find
what if there's a god a hell and heaven
fire is the torment i must face
dying by the souls i have forsaken
no one's going to catch my fall from grace
walking in the shadows
of my blackened mind
angels crave my sorrow
you make me feels so right
when you're around
maybe i've gone astray
but you're the best i've found
now i see things the way i really should
the lesson's learned i've change my ways for good
i'll make it all up to you
seemed like all was lost
things were going wrong
in time i found
it's with you i'm in love
please stay - don't go - be by my side
i know that our love has never died
please stay - don't go - be by my side
i know that our love has never died
i'll make it all up to you
so many times i got here
so many times i had to bleed
crawling and waiting for my...
chance to charge in silence!
locking and loading my fate
i have my flair to the wind
history waits for my name...
be engraved by my own blood!
pulsing with the land
anger boilling in the veins
accurating my aim...
staking out for the prey!
becoming friends with the mist
becoming something else that breathes
thirsty ready to take place!
undentified goal
last time to decide: friend or foe
right now is just me and you...
heads up! coming...!
burning wish...
your heart in my hands!
cold desire...
my prize: your head!
so many times i got here
i have my flair to the wind
accurating my aim...
instinct ready to take place!
locking and loading my fate
becoming something else that breathes
pulsing with the land
heads up! comming...!
burnning wish...
your heart in my hands!
cold desire...
my prize: your head!

"thinking on my yesterdays,"
"i have failed in many ways,"
"but i won't complain, 'cause i"
had my share when luck passed by.
then you came into my life
and became my biggest pride.
"i thought the cards had turned for me,"
"oh, if i knew."
"and then, when this fatal moment came to be"
i couldn't turn the steering wheel around...
"once i feel in love with you,"
now i can't stop feeling blue.
will i ever be the same?
"free me from this crying shame,"
"hey, you won't find me."
"i'll, i'll hide 'till the end of all days."
"i still don't know what happened there,"
"my mind is blocked, i was too scared."
"but they told me you had died,"
now the future's out of sight.
if i could have seen it coming
"i'd had turned the other way,"
"but then we were smashed,"
our lifes were torn apart.
they can tell me a hundred times i'm not to blame.
i didn't turn the steering wheel around...
"once i feel in love with you,"
now i can't stop feeling blue.
will i ever be the same?
"free me from this crying shame,"
"hey, you won't find me."
silver child
awake at night and he waits for the mother of time
she will feed him with glittering wine
silver tide
fade away to the voice of a lullaby
strangling serpents and kisses goodbye
and the seals are washed away (washed away)
a nail for the maker
on the final childhood day
silver pride
fainted light as he aims at the enemy line
showing mercy to a few simple minds
silver chime
is he blind the man with the empty face
he refused to get out of this race
he's a man without a name
a nail for the maker
on the trail of greed and fame
it's the chime of the silent bell
the tune of the farewell
it's the scream of a wishing well
he's crossing the final day
it's a dream of forever
and the seals are washed away
a nail for the maker
it's the final lullaby
(faixa bônus do cd paradox)
"like insects of the night, we are drawn into the light"
feeding off the starglow energy - controlling our fate
bloodsucker selling hope to the hopeless
newborn messiah or the devil incarnate?
surrounded by a field of lost souls
these feeble minds - so easy to control
salvation
damnation
it's all the same to you
but does anyone really know
what the future holds in store
a day will come
when the sun will rise again
rays of black will shine
"and together as one,"
we will walk in the dark of the sun
say a prayer for the unborn child in the womb
the children are the heirs of this dogmatic chaos
is there a future in this claustrophobic tomb?
"we can only rely upon ourselves, to save us"
"we are the resistance, our last line of defense"
prepared to fight for our promised land
"rebels at heart, they will hunt us to the ends of the earth"
the chase is on - forever going on and on
what on earth makes you believe
the rescue will come now?
what on earth is it that you have heard? a savior on his way to you
coming out of nowhere
a knight in shining amour
saving your life
taking care of your strive..
you can run and hide
wait for better times
'till the dark clouds pass by
and you hear no more cries
you can tell more lies
pretend that no one dies
and just think happy thoughts
close your eyes and wish for a miracle..
you can't escape the truth no more
you cannot fool yourself
no one will listen to your stories again
only you can make a change
create a better time
only you can save your own life
and keep up the strive....
suddenly the sky is falling down
my friends
looks like we're all gonna fuckin' die
and this is the sound of the end
it's the end of the world
it's the end of the world
from far away they've come for me
it's the end of the world
apparently the time is running out
my friends
looks like you all better run and hide
and this is the sound of the end
it's the end of the world
it's the end of the world
from far away they've come for me
it's the end of the world
i can hear the world is screaming
paralyzed down on her knees
we're living it up and giving it up
"but not for free, yeah"
do you believe? but nothing is all for me
suddenly the sky is falling down
my friends
it's the end of the world
it's the end of the world
from far away they've come for me
it's the end of the world
"it's in my heart; it's in your soul,"
"you choose to judge,"
is that your role?
"don't analyse or complicate,"
"you'll critisise, you can't relate..."
and now you want some understanding.
what's my point of view?
then i'll just fade away
when i hear all your lies i choke
then i'll just fade away
suffering from the times you spoke i fade
regarding more? just seems much less.
so cynical you must confess.
"i'm dying here, completely blind"
"your will to live- just dampens mine,"
and now you want some understanding...
what's my point of view?
always pretending to want you
it's so easy to make you play my game
always deceiving to get you
so goddamn easy to make you scream my name
"no remorse, no repent"
still to you i'm heaven sent
i don't need a reason to hate you
i don't need a reason to break you
just keep that mouth wide open
"and drain me, my darling, drain me, my darling!"
i don't need a care if you want me
i don't need a care if you need me
just break that pink wide smile
"and drain me, my darling, drain me my darling!"
for so many years i've been faking
"it's so hard to keep lying, smiling in vain"
for so many years i've been taking
"innocent soil, hey baby, loss is my game"
"no remorse, no repent"
still to you i'm heaven sent
i don't need a reason to hate you
i don't need a reason to break you
just keep that mouth wide open
"drain me, my darling, drain me, my darling!"
i don't need a care if you want me
i don't need a care if you need me
just break that pink wide smile
"and drain me, my darling, drain me, my darling!"
no remorse no repent
still to you i'm heaven sent

i don't need a reason to break you
just keep that mouth wide open
"and drain me, my darling, drain me, my darling!"
i don't need a care if you want me
i don't need a care if you need me
just break that pink wide smile
"and drain me, my darling, drain me, my darling!"
just keep that mouth wide open
"and drain me, my darling, drain me, my darling"
"a contest of our lost illusions,"
troopers side by side
recruited for the cyber war craft
a game you're playing all the night
"never surrender don't cry, try to survive"
you've always been a gambler in life
"charge your power, never hide"
imagine the victory is near
ardent we fight - to get a second life
"sometimes, somewhere,"
space legends are marching on
"don't be afraid of strangers,"
it's just a fictious scene
a battlefield of bits and bytes
enemies on screen
imagine the victory is near
ardent we fight - to get a second life
"sometimes, somewhere, space legends, space legends"
"any time, anywhere, a strange and crazy world"
"sometime, somewhere"
space legends will be marching on
reaching for honour by catching the ever highest score
"life in cyber galaxy,"
the final cyber call
"sometimes, somewhere, space legends, space legends"
"any time, anywhere, a strange and crazy world"
"sometime, somewhere"
space legends will be marching on
as i watch through the ages
and gaze upon this world
the troubled race of man
so impetuous and afraid
there?s potential in this race
a man can spark hope
but in masse they do regress
a constant downward slope
how have they come so far
yet have so far to go
it seems evolution stalled
on the nature of a man
from living in caves
to manned flights in space
and for all that it?s worth
"still the sad, pathetic race"
can?t you see what?s plain as day?
it?s always been there inside of you
one saving grace that?s hard to face
embracing the truth will change your fate
it?s up to you and the path you choose
to be led to the slaughter or lead the way
"the quest for light, a worthwhile fight"
will you have what it takes?
come what may
if you?d just look
look inside yourselves
you?ll find the answers to your pain
the hardest road
the hardest road to enlightenment
presents a constant test
of your resolve
time for you
time for you is running out
the human race must evolve
must evolve
can?t you see what?s plain as day?
it?s always been there inside of you
one saving grace that?s hard to face
embracing the truth will change your fate
it?s up to you and the path you choose
to be led to the slaughter or lead the way
"the quest for light, a worthwhile fight"
will you have what it takes?
come what may
as i watch through the ages
the troubled race of man
seems evolution stalled
"still a sad, pathetic race"
will you have what it takes?
come what may
in the morning i
hear the angels they
lick our faces to make you smile
oh help me
we never touch
please remember i
still believe im something beautiful
"and you are,all i need"
"pick me up, i'm crying"
"and you are,all i need"
"pick me up, i'm crying"
in the winter
when the angels
sit between us
and wish that we could know
i would want to
tell you how much
but the words here
are hard for me too
see...
"and you are,all i need"
"pick me up, i'm crying"
"and you are, all i need"
pick me up i'm crying
"and you are, all i need"
"pick me up, i'm crying"
"and you are, all i need"
"turn it down, i'm flying"
"and you are, all i need"
crying
"and you are, all i need"
crying
can you give as much as you can take
can you love as much as you can hate
the flame we share is one as you're aware
the needs we burn is the child we never had
we split our lives to find our mind again
we do divorce so our first fight's regained
together will we remain to say
"together we will live, this century got so much more to give"
"together we will leave, giving to the world a better place to grow"
feelings we keep away from decay
feelings we send each other everyday
does your silence speak the word i hear
does your reserve mean what i fear
the forever we are is the forever we murdered
"stay right here, stand by me"
"together we will live, this century got so much more to give"
"together we will leave, giving to the world a better place to grow"
"together we will live, this century got so much more to give"
"together we will leave, giving to the world a better place to grow"
together will we remain to say
together will we survive to see

now it is 1984
knock-knock at your front door
it's the suede/denim secret police
they have come for your uncool niece
come quietly to the camp
you'd look nice as a drawstring lamp
"don't you worry, it's only a shower"
for your clothes here's a pretty flower.

serpent's egg's already hatched
"you will croak, you little clown"
when you mess with president brown

revenge's a dish best served when it s cold
"i m a predator, a wolf in the fold"
"menace to society, a deranged psychopath"
i m the bastard who brings on the blood bath
taking vengeance out in the street
i m the criminal police can t defeat
"murder, mayhem my claim to fame"
brutal violence dominate my game
i want to destroy you and your kind

"park it, park it, park it, park that truck"
park that truck
"terrorism, anarchy is all that i crave"
i want to see you all rot in your grave

resurrection energy inside
something that i can't define
mystery - i leave my fears behind
something that seems so divine
over and over again
intoxication's running through my veins
confusion - i'm going insane
fever waves are smashing up my brain
illusions and madness remain
over and over again
the rhythm of life - a river of life
on my way to paradise
the rhythm of life - a river of life
the one that keeps us all alive
a fascination penetrates my mind
hungry - i'm longing for life
time for me to spread my wings and fly
hungry - i try to survive
over and over i try
road lies ahead
and a long road lies behind me
see lights passing by
and i know it's the time of their lives
"a million miles, lightyears i've been traveling"
to watch and enjoy this world
that i've seen as galore
oh amusing over it all
closing my eyes to remember it all
embracing the past and the future to come
kiss that road that leads me to my tribe
i've found my way home
i've returned to where i belong
back to where i stand from
back to paradise
time to return to the tribe
"the other side, always close to the edge"
"been walking a thin line, always had someone watch my step"
"a mystery, to make it out alive and say"
"the battle is over, and i know who's been with me"
now amusing over it all
on top of this world i remember it all
awaiting the sunrise and sunset (something)
kiss the way that leads me to my tribe
back to the tribe
i've found my way home
i've returned to where i belong
back to where i stand from
back to paradise
time to return to the tribe
back to the tribe
i've found my way home
i've returned to where i belong
back to where i stand from
back to paradise
time to return to the tribe
"all we've been, all we see was born so long ago"
"in times of joy and of tears, we carried on"
"the winds were still, did no harm to our shores"
"but the seed's already sewn, now the storm will come"
over and over we're downcast
"only, it's only a dark past"
do you know we reached somehow the end of every story
welcome to the final show it's here in all its glory
you can run but all you flee is a life of sorrow
time will tell what kind of fate will be waiting for us now
built on sand by our hands were all of our homes
"turn around, realize this world is not our own"
so we have to succumb to the call of fate
"hear it now, it leads us down to future's open gate"
falling we're falling with closed eyes
losing now losing our old disguise
do you know we reached somehow the end of every story
welcome to the final show it's here in all its glory
you can run but all you flee is a life of sorrow
time will tell what kind of fate will be waiting for us now
"there's no sense, the fire burns"
"when wisdom fails, it changes all"
the wheel embodies all that keeps on turning
"blood red skies, i feel so cold"
"no innocence, we play our role"
the wheel embodies all where are we going
all in all you'd expect the wise to be wiser
fallen from grace
all and all i guess
"we should have known better, 'cause"
what about us?
isn't it enough?
no we're not in paradise
this is who we are
this is what we got
not it's not our paradise
but it's all we want
and it's all we're fighting for
though it's not paradise
"you and us, or i and them"
there come's a time to take a stand
"the wheel is watching all, it keeps on burning"
"the venom works, it's like a curse"
"a trojan horse, when will we learn"
"the wheel embodiesm, that keeps returning"
all in all you'd expect the wise to be wiser
fallen from grace
all and all i guess
"we should have known better, 'cause"
what about us?
isn't it enough?
no we're not in paradise
this is who we are
this is what we got
not it's not our paradise

head crash - i can't see you
spit teeth - i can hear you
i feel your pounding me onto the street
i've learned to know the taste of concrete
why don't you follow me?
"street brash - time flies, tick-tock"
eyes flash - feels like electroshock
"i feel the blood gushing, crumbling away"
i know this marks the end of my hey-day
through the essence of your smile
makes this fight all worthwhile
"oh, the perseverance of your life"
"there you were, by my side"
giving me strength through your love and pride
"she says carry on, carry on"
"oh, the stars, they shine so bright"
are they there for you and i?
i know you see the light
"carry on, be strong my son"
this is the end of innocence
"carry on, when i'm gone"
this is the end of innocence
"this is the end, my friend"
sacrifice is all we have
finding solace in your laugh
the freedom will ease your pain
washing tides and season change
things will never be the same
"oh, she says carry on, carry on"
"carry on, be strong my son"
this is the end of innocence
"carry on, when i'm gone"
this is the end of innocence
"this is the end, my friend"
again and again and again
you bring me to ecstasy
you have died but i don't care
burial place is not your true relief
fistfucks in your backdoos hole
necropenetrating lust takes command
path of sin - sin
create the sin - sin
in darkness we'll always be together
forever your body belongs to me
wrapped in pleasure we will burn
in eternity we shall be reborn
path of sin - sin
create the sin - sin
i'm waiting for the rain now
to settle the dusty air
clearing up my emotions
facing it all if i dare
i've been thinking
i've been trying
but i've always been denying
wasted days are still inside of me
it's time to set them free
why can't we see what is going on?
there are not so many years to be wasted
until the damage is done and the beauty is gone
save our souls
what is the price that we pay?
save our souls
do we have nothing to say?
"torn from your body,removed while you scream"
dissect to collet my blade now reams
pieces of flesh lie by the side
worn on my body or put on display
you mark your skin it gives you pleasure
"i take your precious art, it becomes my leather"
taking your hide before you have died
decency defied
crudely i cut away
all are my prey
tell me how it feels when your flesh is peeled
you are vain with your art
i desire it torn appart
with my insane hunting the removal of flesh now starts
"you mark your skin, it gives you pleasure"
"i take your precious art, it becomes my leather"
taking your hide before you have died
decency defied
to you a design
now a trophy made mine
to you a design
now a trophy made mine
i seek to find
to satisfy my fucked mind
i seek to find
to satisfy my fucked mind
[solo jack owen]
ignoring your cries
exposing your insides
violence defined
"torn from your body, removed while you scream"
"dissect to collect, my blade now reams"
pieces of flesh lie side by side
worn on my body or put on display
"you mark your skin, it gives you pleasure"
"i take your precious art, it becomes my leather"
taking your hide before you have died
decency defied
i've heard the devil speak
speak through a man
and i found them listening
ive seen the holy take
take to a fool
and i've seen them following
"long enough to know, i fall"
somewhere outside it all
let me recuse myself
lose myself
excuse myself from your world
recuse myself
lose myself
excuse myself from your world
i've felt the weight of death
ive held the hand
and i've tread a fading line
i'm not afraid to go
and still i am
i've sung the battle cry
"long enough to know, i fall"
somewhere outside it all
let me recuse myself
lose myself
excuse myself from your world
recuse myself
lose myself
excuse myself from your world
i never saw myself inside your shadow
but now i dig to pull myself out of your grave
i don't know where i stand
i just can't meet your demands
time to find my way out
let me recuse myself
lose myself
excuse myself from your world
from your world
can you remember the morning
i told you goodbye
just when a new was dawning
a piece of me died
somehow i have to try to
getting used to being alone
if i could only hold you once again
i'd never let go
save me a prayer
when day turns to night
lord won't you
show me the light
one day - i'll find back to my heart and soul again
one day - i swear swear by your name
memories keep me awake
and you're there by my side
i wonder if its only in my mind
that i am alive
save me a prayer
when day turns to night
lord won't you
tell me i'm right
one day - i'll find back to my heart and soul again
one day - i swear swear by your name
"what would induce you to swear your allegiance to god, tonight?"
joined at the hip to a million-volt switch of the
light ? alright
"you want to find out, what the planet?s about"
falling from grace leaves a cool empty space in the
sky...
your eyes are black as they see the red ball of the
"sun, and they?re blind"
dribbling with come as the volts start to arc through your mind
"cruel, but it?s kind"
"like father, like son, chop off the head and the body lives on"
falling from grace leaves a cool empty space in the
sky...
"like father, like son, chop off the head and the body lives on"
heaven that made you has screwed you and laughed
falling from grace leaves a cool empty space in the
sky...
some people live their lifes like
they'd be immortal forever
some people waste their cards like
they'd have a second deck at hand
but while they start their hassle
and put their energy
in senseless things the clock ticks on
"time flies, 'till you waste away, now"
this will be your destiny
"the soul cries, when you fade away, now"
this will be your destiny
you better find your meaning
and use your days before you die
why is it that you're running
just like the hamster in his wheel
you spend your days with things that
"you don't like, this is what i see"
and all that wasted moments
fill you with pain and hate
"so turn around, it's not too late"
"time flies, 'till you waste away, now"
this will be your destiny
"the soul cries, when you fade away, now"
this will be your destiny
you better find your meaning
and use your days before you die
"when you were here before,"
"couldn't look you in the eye,"
"you're just like an angel,"
your skin makes me cry.
"you float like a feather,"
in a beautiful world
"i wish i was special,"
you're so very special
"but i'm a creep, i'm a weirdo,"
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here.
"i don't care if it hurts,"
"i want to have control,"
"i want a perfect body,"
i want a perfect soul.
"i want you to notice,"
when i'm not around.
"you're so very special,"
i wish i was special
"but i'm a creep, i'm a weirdo,"
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here.
uh-uh uh-uh
"she's running out the door,"
she's running out the...
"run, run, run, run, run."
"whatever makes you happy,"
whatever you want.
"you're so very special,"
"i wish i was special,"
"but i'm a creep, i'm a weirdo,"
what the hell am i doing here?
"i don't belong here,"
i don't belong here.
oh my god i could barely sit down to write this line
and i'd give anything to hear your fucking voice again
so apathetic and i know you must be dead inside
you don't know what love is
and i will paint the darkness on
everything that reminds me of you
and i haven't slept in days
for i may not wake up
and you say that passion kills?
i forgot what this hallow pit in my stomach felt like
"now i am become death, destroyer of the worlds"
"now i am become death, destroyer of the worlds"
you are all that i have left
and i am lost without you
this is the last heart you ever take and this is the last life that you ever destroy
your bloods not worth spilling
"i feel so lost for me inside,"
"lost am i, will it never end,"
but never am i stained black
"now the end is drawing near,"
"my hate is growing, can't you hear,"
it burns me with my cruelty
(and i'm off!)
like the fire of pain in the daylight
"full of hate, your hatred gets up doom"
"hate... i can't control it anymore,"
you'll see the red light more and more
trapping you in destroying despite
by the red light in my eyes
"so, better wake up, drink your blood,"
follow me and be a god
"can't you fucking look into my eyes,"
"watch this god arise, yeah"
(come on!)
"i feel the last one in this time,"
"lost am i, will it never end"
"but never am i stained black, jet black"
"now walk away and flee into hell,"
take away and bleed my heart
i do my blood-red sigh
"i can feel your hate of death,"
i'm running on this darkened little path
"take your time, beat me down, sometime, to die (die!)"
"hate... i can't control it anymore,"
see the red light more and more
trapping you in destroying despite
by the red light in my eyes
"doesn't matter what is on the top, right, way too down below,"
that's how the werewolf burns in me
"oh god, i see the light again,"
i'm gonna be getting someone in my grave
"hate... i can't control it anymore,"
see the red light more and more
trapping you in destroying despite
by the red light in my eyes
for everything you do
i'd like to swallow you
and everyday i'm gonna blame you
even if you justify
every fucking bullshit lie
it only makes me want to break you
you pull me down
and you crucify my name
you make me insane
it's broken now
don't ever look my way
don't even think i'm playin'
'cause i fucking hate you
you're such a liar
and i love to hate you
you're all the same to me
when you repeatedly
take advantage of me

and you crucify my name

'cause i fucking hate you
you're such a liar
and i love to hate you
you're all the same to me
and i fucking hate
you're such a liar
and i love to hate you
you're all the same to me
fuck you (fuck you)

fuck you (fuck you)
fuck you (fuck you)
when tyrany will have an end around the world
and freedom has become a part to all of our lives
when slavery will have an end to all of us
then we don't mind the colour of our skin
we go straight for paradise
no more treasons no more lies
one day i will know what we are fighting for
under the eternal sky we unite to be free from your spell
someday we will know what we are crying for
under the eternal flame that's called freedom
again we unite to be free
dictators and pretenders we don't need no more
sending death and soldiers round the world
when no one listens to ya and just turns around
then your worlds will be blowing in the wind
we go straight for paradise
no more treasons no more lies
one day i will know
under the eternal sky we unite to be free from your spell
someday we will know
under the eternal flame that's called freedom
again we unite
when tyrany ended and slavery as brought to fall
then freedom will show
that the world we do live in is worth to fight for
one day we will know what we are fighting for
under the eternal sky we unite to be free from your spell
someday we will know what we are crying for
under the eternal flame that's called freedom
again we unite to be free

all or nothing
it's sometimes life's between what's undecided
and all for nothing
it seems i'm wasting my time
don't look down on me
like i don't know anything that i've been doing
you talk down to me
it's time you take a better look inside
i'll never be the same
i'm moving back onto my ways
i'm looking for changes into my way
bow down to me
taken your pride and stuff it down inside
vows are ruined
"losing my faith, losing time"
better off you than me
i just can't stand another day when you're in
my way
a long time brewing
it's time you kiss your ass goodbye
i'll never be the same
i'm moving back onto my ways
i'm looking for changes into my way
i'll never be the same
i'm moving back onto my ways
i'm looking for changes into my way
i'll never be the same
i'm moving back onto my ways
i'm looking for changes
i'll never be the same
i'm moving back onto my ways
i'm looking for changes
i'm looking for changes
into my way
into my way
into my way
welcome to the circus
leave your brain outside
sit back - relax
as we feed you lies
spoon fed stimulation
glittering fashion fascination
you are lost in the game
media corruption
you'll be amused
by the things we do to you
but in the bitter end
the clown is you
end of the line
you sold your soul
for a better life
you are better off dead
you had one life
you had one shot
you blew it
and you knew it
the rot sets in
no self control
at the end of the line
you play the fool
"in the darkness i will shine, cast no shadows, not define"
"i walk on water, float on air, there's no other to compare"
"i have this fascination, no cause for deviation"
it's called levitation
"there's no cause to start and scream, nor rub your eyes,"
this is no dream
"although i sit upon this chair, i rise and float up in the air"
"i have this fascination, no cause for deviation"
it's called levitation
"magnetic force, repel-attract, once it starts, there's no turning back"
"i offer you this chance to learn, take it now there's no return"
and i hear you call
i must be out of my mind as i hear you call
my name is even though i can't see you anywhere
surely this feeling must be coming from something
someone gave me yesterday as i searched for you
and i hear you call
i hear you call my name
but when i turn around
there's nothing to be found
i must be dreaming a dream of a lunatic
my fingers taste like some strawberry ice-cream
i hear you call my name but i don't think it's
the same i heard you whisper in my ear
people runnin'
in the street
looking for some
meat to eat
it's in your
dirty magazines
all across your
tv screens
midnight riders
in the street
feel the fire
catch the heat
you better go
down below
you better go
down below
see the ladies
of the night
built for speed
to my delight
i steal them
in my limousine
hear them shout
hear them scream
midnight riders
in the street
feel the fire
catch the heat
it's a dirty job
but somebody's gotta do it
s-c-r-e-a-m!!!
you better go
down below
you better go
down below
(and she's down for the count!)
in our every moment
with our every breath
even far away
your eyes are ways
disputing my darkness
in your darkest hour
with the dying sun
preying all alone
your lips the downfall
colouring my days
as if in a spring of rage
your fury and beauty would incarnate
in your every moment
lays a cruel fate
even from a distance
your hands of doom
disquieting my darkness
as if in a spring of rage
your fury and beauty would incarnate
release my pain
widowed in the whiteness pure
clouded captive by the moon
as if in a spring of rage
your fury and beauty would incarnate
agony is the price
that you'll pay in the end
domination consumes you
then calls you a friend
it's a twisted fall
binds are like steel
and manipulates the will to be
and it's hard to see
how soon we forget
when there's nothing else
left to destroy
it's a useless ploy
your eyes will see
the dawn of the day
and the writing
on the wall
those words that stare
into your soul
and to yourself
you will befall
it's domination!
pushed into living hell
it's domination!
a now blacked heart
is reaching out divinity
body suspended by chains over razors
and nails it's a penalty
each razor a vice and each nail
marks the demise of your life.
grim construction grows
has life played a trick
sealed you in brick by brick
till your end forcing you to bend
your eyes will see
the dawn of the day
and the writing
on the wall
those words that stare
into your soul
and to yourself
you will befall
it's domination pushed into living hell
it's domination!
there exists a place of agony
where children are held captive
"belt across the back, the nuns attack"
believe in god or be beaten to death
"work to earn your keep, no time to sleep"
or go without and die of thirst
resent your birth - thanks to god!!!!!!!!!!!
at father baker's the pain is divine
if you are lucky you'll get out alive
"welcome to terror, you're where you belong"
father is waiting to show you your wrong
learn early on to behave or you'll die
"live with his torture, no one to confide"
innocence lost by the rage he inflicts
repent to god or the pain will persist
"kept inside a cage, humiliate"
till father takes confession
whipped unmercifully and left to bleed
and by the end to be one with god
"fast you into place, the final phase"
before you meet his maker
do as you are told or you will go
and then you'll know what is suffering
on and on we go again
there seems no point of view
over under upside down
i don't know what to do
there used to be passion
don't know when it slipped away
i look around at everyone
it happens every day
i need to get off this spinnin' merry-go-round
i'm upside down
no sense in talkin' till the morning comes
i need to feel it once again
this fire is dyin'
i can't feel it burnin' inside anymore
this fire is dyin'
i can't feel the passion that we had before
anymore
"contradiction, trepidation, different points of view"
sitting in a place i said i'd never go with you
given half a chance i guess i'd throw it all away
my opinion doesn't matter when there's shades of gray
i need to know what you're lookin' fore
no sense in talkin' till the morning comes
i need to feel it once again
this fire is dyin'
i can't feel it burnin' inside anymore
this fire is dyin'
i can't feel the passion that we had before
anymore
i need the passion to live my life
live my dreams the way i like
give no reasons for what i have
i tried to love you
the best i can
this fire is dyin'
i can't feel it burnin' inside anymore
this fire is dyin'
i can't feel the passion that we had before
anymore
"fly, fly... serpent and the lion"
winged son of appolion
"rise, rise... titans of the light"
immaculate divine
with wings like this i fly on the abyss
return to the eve
golden throne of elohim
slay the prophet's arteries
war
war of the titans
war
titanomachy
"kornos, koios, krios, prometheus"
"hyperion, chaos, tartarus, zeus"
"i, the messenger"
i erupt the firmament
"i, i ascend to heavens"
sitting on the throne of hate
with claws like this in this symmetry
i cut my eyes and tore my wings
impaled the sun - amen
war
war of the titans
war
titanomachy
"kornos, koios, krios, prometheus"
"hyperion, chaos, tartarus, zeus"
war of the titans
war of the titans
far away (with legs!)
we are gifted to be scared
we need stacks of weapons to survive
marching for religious reasons
marching on and on to save our lives
when will it have an end
how can we live in harmony
how can i understand the way things gonna be
take me far away and set my spirit higher
take me far away and set my soul on fire
and i pretend to understand
whatever comes i'll be there for you
genetically influenced
is our harvest how far can we go
someday my own clone will come
take away my wife how could i know
sometimes i feel so sad
sometimes i could just go insane
but when i see your smile it makes me strong again
take me far away and set my spirit higher
take me far away and set my soul on fire
and i pretend to understand
whatever comes i'll be there for you
(solo)
when will it have an end
how can we live in harmony
how can i understand the way things gonna be
take me far away and set my spirit higher
take me far away and set my soul on fire
and i pretend to understand
whatever comes i'll be there for you
whatever comes i'll be there for you
whatever comes............i'll be there.........for........you!!!!
"can't change the past, the future's unknown"
"don't turn your back, you threw the first stone"
i gave you love i give you hate
i've granted all your wishes
i gave you hope i gave you pain
you are the devil
you've reached the top you sit on your throne
you're going down and you're going alone
"i gave you love, i give you hate"
and when your darkness fades away
i gave you hope i give you pain
you better run
king for a day it's your carnal desire
king for a day i will call you a liar
"once there was love, now there is only doubt"
feel the anger taking over my faith
"i gave you love, i give you hate"
i'm counting all my scars
"i gave you hope, i give you pain"
your life is war
when you see your dreams engulfed in flames
you'll see just my smile there will be no rain
"i gave you love, i give you hate"
and now it's me against the world
"i gave you hope, i give you pain"
you better run
king for a day it's your carnal desire
king for a day i will call you a liar
king for a day
i've been broken and beat down
king for a day
i am no longer your clown
"i don't dare to take it slowly,"
cause time may pass me by.
"restless like a newborn morning,"
i am hard to satisfy.
will you take me away?
"in the silence of the darkness,"
"i can't pretend i'm wide awake,"
afraid i could go under.
"in the silence of the darkness,"
"i stumble for the light of day,"
but the journey never ends.
"i can paint the world with flowers,"
grown by heaven's gate.
"and reckless like the stormy ocean,"
i could cover them with hate.
but it all sounds the same.
"in the silence of the darkness,"
"i can't pretend i'm wide awake,"
afraid i could go under.
"in the silence of the darkness,"
"i stumble for the light of day,"
but the journey never ends.
"in the silence of the darkness,"
"i can't pretend i'm wide awake,"
afraid i could go under.
"in the silence of the darkness,"
"i stumble for the light of day,"
but the journey never ends.
smoking
resting on its grave
the carcass bursting where it lies
no more truth
no honest games
the serpent writhes within us all
lava streams of molten flesh
into their mountain holes retire
now sleeping eyes of death awake
your drug of choice
truth or lie
i believe
you and me
i believe
evil
i believe
you will see
i believe
evil
what does not kill it
makes it strong
the carcass stares it will not die
it feeds on you
it feeds on me
i know his name
you know mine too
i believe
you and me
i believe
evil
i believe
you will see
i believe
evil
[solo]
i believe
you and me
i believe
evil
i believe
you will see
i believe
evil
perereca ®
scorn the omen - architects of deceit
pulverized within the jaws of defeat
"our ruin enginered, we've reached the gates of fear"
forging vengeance in the city of doom
ripping death from sin's unholy womb
"the riders on the storm, cursed the day they're born"
we were warned...
strike them down - strike with power
kill them all froom shore to shore
we destroy - we devour
we command the vicious dogs of war
treads of iron crush the skulls of the damned
stench of burning flesh covers the land
rising from the screams - a godless war machine
execution - fire scorches the sky
crimson horseman runs with genocide
"as the seas turn red, we raise the living dead"
or so it's said...
strike them down - strike with power
kill them all from shore to shore
we destroy - we devour
we command the vicious dogs of war
bow your heads and abandon hope
we're the gods of pain
raise your hands if you'll join with us
and let the madness reign
forsaken and forgotten
condemned - hopeless and alone
the sickened and the rotten
infect everything you've ever know
war hammer of disaster
crushing every living head
surrender to the masters
the brainwashed electric living dead
there's no escaping
"the more i learn, the less i know"
i must be crazy
"i'm giving in, i'n letting go"
"if all the world's a stage,"
it's just a masquerade of crazies
hit the lights and start the show...
the night is black
7 figures walk the streets of louviers
"picard is one, another two are priests"
"and then the nuns, going to"
the meetings held in secrecy
"evil company full of secrecy, again and again"
the room is dark
"candles on the wall, they've been here before"
the christian cross is hanging high above
the altar of god
madeleine is at the gate
hazy feeling in her brain
as the strangers come in to
the meetings held in secrecy
"evil company full of secrecy, again and again"
the strangers brought
"the sweetest little child, but something's wrong"
"the baby cries, someone here will die"
and now the nuns pray
the meetings held in secrecy
"evil company full of secrecy, again and again"
madeleine and the other nuns
they hold the infant up to the cross
as father picard and the priests
approach with hammers and nails
above the high temple ov matter
svastikas ov time slash the heaven
"and from the pit, from the slime"
from the thought
gliphotic intruder decays
"lilith, thantilaxath, zi'uaq"
non-manifestation born in the dark ov a day
can you hear distant desert call?
and stone you see - by adytum builders
"...rejected, damned?"
"deeper, deeper, in the night, world, fear"
towards the noctuary ov the truth
from the mirror we crawls out
devouring eden's light
in the tunnels ov seth he abides
"shugal, the howler!"
who am i? where i'm going? where?
we live dreaming
slipping from body to body
and nightmares still our breath
and his in our souls
poisoning with the venom ov existence
"just say ""illusion"""
when the first sunray falls
in your hawk eye
and don't look in the past
it hurts and there the shadow lies in wait
so with every step on the oath
beyond good and evil
"always, sometimes, always seems to be"
"chaos, crisis, always feeds off me,"
"then you'll get carried away,"
the trauma is all too real.
"and ohh too much, it's in my soul don't let it show"
"and ohh too much, it's in my head don't let it grow again"
"as i'm walking i'm breathless, i'd welcome clarity"
my final excitement was failing to agree
then you'll get carried away
the drama is all too near...
"and ooh too much, it's in my soul don't let it show"
"and ooh, too much, it's in my head don't let it grow again"
howitzer glare and spitfire blade
wooed by dresden serenades
her soundtrack now a bombing raid
bored of vaudeville
god was six days sober
on the night that she was born
to the glistening star of a bible class
an icon now in religious porn
she was alice through the gloryhole
an ejaculate misconception
"disney-esque, the high priestess"
of greed and deepest dark deception
all best-to-bury whims
for miss libertina grimm
"she, that little red riding crop"
brer werewolf at her stocking tops
beneath the tightened leather strop
of the basque of the houndervilles
at the stroke of midnight come
in a poisonous pen dipped in omen
to her surgeon full of general curses
in the hand of morgue redeemers
though the dead always pleased her more
squatting in their coffins
flirting curtsies to the thirteenth floor
tip your hats
for sweet libertina grimm
fantasy and candy stores
snow white and the seven straws
smoke and mirrors on all fours...
libertina grimm
"her brothers grim, her sisters through"
the final dance will be the cue
she amputates to fit the shoe
libertina grimm
libertina grimm
mystery kindled in a blackened room
nine candles lit to improve the gloom
she sees the dark as she feels her womb
full of hidden secrets
"no, don't go"
don't you leave me here
so alone
libertina
"no, don't you go"
don't you leave me here
so alone
where the dead are free to roam
like a dream that fades away
my memories of sunshine days
when all the skies are turning grey
and then the nightmare starts again
"the spell of the blackened sun, no time to wonder"
"the end is closing in, let the dance begin"
the blackened sun and now we wonder
"the time is running by, keep this in your mind!"
the voice of reason dies away
how many more preachers do we obey ?
why do we rape our paradise ?
why do we waste this grand design ?
"the spell of the blackened sun, no time to wonder"
"the end is closing in, let the dance begin"
the blackened sun and now we wonder
"the time is running by, keep this in your mind!"
the times are changing so fast
i wonder how long it lasts
the clock is ticking time is running out
the hatred fills this earth
and for what is worth
we're in the end before we know
throughout the years
i have struggled to find the answer that
i never knew
it strucked me like a million lightnings
and here i am telling to you
every second of day it is coming your way
future unknown is here to stay
got to open your mind
or you will be led to astray
there's a time to live
there's a time to die
but no one can't escape the destiny
look all these things we've done
under the burning sun
is this the way to carry on?
so take a look at yourself
and tell me what do you see
a wolf in clothes of the lamb?
throughout the...
every second...
let your spirit free
through window of your mind
unchain your soul from hate
all you need is faith
i control my life
i am the one
you control your life
but don't forget your destiny...
it's time to say goodbye
i know it will make you cry
you make your destiny
i know you'll find the way
and outside sun is bright
the things will be allright
i will be back one day to you
so please wait for me
no more chance
bear your souls
bind the flesh
(?)
oh when the seas bear forth (bear forth)
repel and spring
infest the life of them
they fear the eastern gods (their gods!)
no men are (?) or no matter (?)
for the life of them
oh!
though the fire it rages
you have been warned
and the hate will not consume me
you shall bring your torch
living in darkness
carnivorous rejoice
and the hate will not consume me
rise up and contort
contort!
and with the fields of the deep (of the deep)
bind the flesh
and hold us strong
though the fire it rages
you have been warned
and the hate will not consume me
you shall bring your torch
living in darkness
carnivorous rejoice
and the hate will not consume me
rise up and contort
(contort! yeah!)
let the darkness cover me
i've learn to fix these scars
let the darkness cover me
you shall bear your torch
though the fire it rages
you have been warned
and the hate will not consume me
you shall bring your torch
yeah!
and the hate will not consume me
you shall bring your torch
neglect afraid to say
repentance awaits
rejected jaded decayed
a vengeance awaits
behold the darkness true the light
the flame upon us soon ignites
the depth of solemn ones distain
a yearning dread forever slaves
punishment through time
unfold the righteous soon ordained
inside a tomb of souls disgraced
the depths of solemn tears distain
returning death into the grey
punishment through time
you perceive your life & goals depressed
"you conceal a crisis, souls repressed"
reaching out untied for sudden death
neglect afraid to say
repentance awaits
rejected jaded decayed
a vengeance awaits
the words die in my throat and there is nothing i can do
"from a child to a monster, and now a child among"
monsters
your life is a mockery twisted in the wind
is this your legacy of ignorance
i'll give my heart and soul to see you free again
i would do anything
so many mistakes have led to this disaster
ten years of reflection don't waste a moment
are you loathe to seek the truth you must choose
i'll give my heart and soul to see you free again
i would do anything
if you could see the hope i've always seen in you
i would do anything
the weight that's crushing can be relieved
leave the sins of the past at your feet
pray for life or bleed to death.
pray for life or bleed to death
i'll bleed the reddest blood to see you live again
i would do anything
if you could see the hope i've always seen in you
i would do anything
sometimes i wonder
if love has a meaning
feels like the sadness won't end
sometimes i wonder why do we try
we're looking for answers in vain
every step i've taken
led me closer to the edge
"and i've fallen, i've fallen"
and there's no way to return
lost and mistreated
by your words and by your promises
the lies were ephemeral
but the truth won't fade away
live it up (live it up)
i know i'll find the courage to be free again
the sun comes after rain
live it up (live it up)
the struggle has been real
but now i've gotta break these chains
don't wanna be
another victim of love
no knife through my heart
why don't you let me go?
don't wanna be
another victim of love
i've done it times before
i won't get fooled again (and again)
how many hours
have we both wasted?
our life was written in sand
we took our chances
but love turned into hate
nothing left but anger and pain
our story turned to poison
and we just drank it all
it was burning down our throat
and flowing through our veins
"the passion, the fury"
nothing was like it was meant to be
the truth is hard to face
but i'm done looking away
live it up (live it up)
i know i'll find the courage to be free again
the sun comes after rain
live it up (live it up)
the struggle has been real
and i'm done playing games
and i'm done being the one to blame
don't wanna be
another victim of love
no knife through my heart
why don't you let me go
don't wanna be
another victim of love
i've done it times before
i won't get fooled again (and again)
and i know it will be fine (it will be fine)
and i know that time will heal it all (heal it all)
and one day you will believe again (believe again)
"'cause i know, yes i know"
"so for now, let it go"
don't wanna be
another victim of love
no knife through my heart
why don't you let me go
don't wanna be
another victim of love
i've done it times before
i won't get fooled again
don't wanna be
another victim of love
i've done it times before
i won't get fooled again
many rocks the rapid has
a lot of billows the sea
more plentiful are my cares
then cones on a spruce
beard moss on a juniper
gnarls upon a pine bark
knobs upon a fir
husks on a grass-top
boughs on a bad tree.
drag my cares away
carry off my griefs
for no horse can draw
no iron-shod jerk
without the shaft-bow shaking off
the cares of this skinny one
the sorrows of this black bird

and my lord is steel
if you see me you just passed your time
to the hills you can run but not hide
blood and death are wherever i ride
armed for battle the lord on my side
stand and face the lord of steel
the lord of steel
in the eyes of the lord you have sinned
let your punishment begin
only by death you atone
you shall not die alone
for the glory of battle
i will fight until i die
live one day as an eagle
or a lifetime as a fly
like a candle burning
the wheels of time are turning
the lord of steel commands you
to die by my hand
stand and fight the lord of steel
time to face the lord of steel
junior's eyes looked up to the skies in tears
"he prayed that his maker, the giver and taker, would `pear"
"junior sighed, as his hands reached out to the sky"
"junior cried, the day that his best friend died"
yeah!
they're coming home again tomorrow
i'm sorry it won't be for long
with all the pain i've watched you live within
i'll try my hardest not to cry
when it is time to say goodbye
"junior's eyes, they couldn't disguise the pain"
"his father was leaving, and junior's grieving again"
innocent eyes watched the man who had gave everything
"junior's sorrow, who knew what tomorrow would bring?"
yeah!
they're coming home again tomorrow
i'm sorry it won't be for long
with all the pain i've watched you live within
i'll try my hardest not to cry
when it is time to say goodbye
junior's eyes looked into the skies once more
"now he knew well, this life was hell for sure"
"he desperately tried, his fingertips stretched to the stars"
"reaching for reason, along with the time and the scars"
yeah!
they're coming home again tomorrow
i'm sorry it won't be for long
with all the pain i've watched you live within
i'll try my hardest not to cry
when it is time to say goodbye
por aila brandão
losing you
in the dead of the night
as the candles die out
i'm watching her going to sleep
she has to be strong
she's left all along
i have to go out in the fields
you're all i ever wanted
there's just pain without you
"but some things come between us,"
my love
words cannot express
the sorrow i feel
i wish i could turn back time
to where we began
where love had no end
and you and me were as one
you're all i ever wanted
there's just pain without you
"hear the angels cry in heaven, my love"
i'm scared i might be losing you
and i don't know which way to turn
i feel i might be losing you
i can't live my life without your love
the sound of your breath
the smell of your hair
the touch of your golden skin
they keep me awake
through out every night
to think of what might have been
you're all i ever wanted
you're my life and my lust
"i could never mean to hurt you, my love"
i have fought so many battles
i have suffered so much pain
without you to love and hold me
all of this would be in vain
"down, chemical sacrament,"
blasphemous prayer.
deliver me from this
so serene apocalypse.
"just make me fucking numb,"
"deaf, blind and fucking dumb."
return to sacred sleep.
"this could be my requiem,"
and i'll feel no pain.
"this could be my requiem,"
but don't bury me too deep.
"drain infected brine,"
sickened cesspool shell of mine.
"strap up the hands of time,"
and push the soul into the vein.
"just make me fucking numb,"
"deaf, blind and fucking dumb."
return to sacred sleep.
"this could be my requiem,"
and i'll feel no pain.
"this could be my requiem,"

you’ve never been held by the hand of god
who’s rocking the cradle if he is not
he turned the oil into his blood
panzer divisions burning in the mud
"the stain of freedom, he’s washed it out"
"who’s rocking the cradle, i have no doubt"
"sleeping eyes awake, to see his hooded gaze"
"whispers on the wind, the darker side of ecstasy"
satan – has left his killing floor
satan – has left his killing floor
satan – hell fires burn no more
satan – has left his killing floor
so now it’s dreamtime for you tonight
so now it’s dreamtime and all is quiet
you’ve never been held by the hand of god

satan – has left his killing floor
satan – has left his killing floor
satan – his fires burn no more

falling on our faces
they don't care anyway

we are hard and grey
"always fate, to do what they say"
calling me deranged
"feeling power, i must take its place some way"
never gonna run away
seeking out the path

devil's driving down the track
helens wheels they won't turn back
engine racing down a one way street
speeds chasing that red line heat
into the blackness into the night
out of the tunnel into the light
red for danger that's just for show
climb aboard come as you go
hard to steer when the devil's driving
helens wheels and the brakes won't hold
hard to steer when the devil's driving
helens wheels and the brakes won't hold
too smart to come she just arrived
only gave her one but she's using five
minutes of time in the usual place
if i was strapped in you could sit on my place
the doors were locked the windows sealed
hitting me with the jack was the devil's deal
blue light flashing as the lipstick smudge
diving for cover in a tunnel of glove
hard to steer when the devil's driving
helens wheels and the brakes won't hold
hard to steer when the devil's driving
helens wheels and the brakes won't hold
"something's driving me, i don't know where"
something down in my cellar somewhere
no one waiting for me down the line
"no one waiting for me this time, check it out"
hard to steer when the devil's driving
hell on wheels and the brakes won't hold
hard to steer when the devil's driving
hell on wheels and the brakes won't hold
knuckle down stick shift take it slow
easy come means easy go
lay off the gas make it last
’cos under my hood she's blowing fast
into the blackness into the night
out of the tunnel into the light
"red for danger, just for show"
climb aboard come as you go
hard to steer when the devil's driving
helens wheels and the brakes won't hold
hard to steer when the devil's driving
helens wheels and the brakes won't hold
"hard to steer, that’s it"
"hard to steer, oh"
"hard to steer, when the devil’s driving, come on"
"hard to steer, you know it’s hard to steer"
"hard to steer, when the devil’s driving"
i am the lightning
and the storm
all hell broke loose
on the night i was born
a child of fire
and burning flames
look to the east
and you'll see hence i came
might throw you into the darkness
or save you by the light
of the moon and stars
ever shining
celestial bodies burning bright
burning bright
"i, i am the night"
"i, i am the night"
i am the terror
the beast at large
heed my warning
sound the alarm
an endless shadow
for daylight you pray
lock your doors
but you cannot get away
tender angels of mercy
how they run from my sight
eclipsed into darkness
searching only for the light
for the light
for the light
"i, i am the night"
"i, i am the night"
you face me in silence and hope is in your eyes
unspoken yet pleading you wait for my reply
alone now i tremble in want of your embrace
"let not tears fall for me, let me show the way"
don't know why you have such belief in m
to justify this i'd try eternally
i will not forget what you've done for me
shed not a tear i'll be with you endlessly
how i wish i could say
what you want to hear
long ago i swore that i'd always keep you near
i know now it seems like my vow was empty then
but in time you will see i'd do it all again
i lie back close my eyes again
the dreams are there
my last chance slipped away
you'll never know i cared
i count this with reason as most of my regret
now i hope you can see that i will not forget
"you've got to get his daughter, daughter, daughter"
"you've got to get his daughter, daughter, daughter"
"you've got to get his daughter, daughter, daughter"
"you've got to get his daughter, daughter, daughter"
"wish i could always love you, always hold you, all the time"
"share with me the last moment, for i'll take you, to"
the sky
you always wanted to be the last one
but you never thought what it would be like
to be the only one
to the sky i will reflect my love for it shall be thy guiding light
shine so bright that you will find your way through
the darkness of the night
"through the skies i will take you, find the time to"
touch the stars
"falling dark leads you to me, whispers so sweet leave no scars"
you always wanted to be the last one
but you never thought what it would be like
to be the only one
to the sky i will reflect my love for it shall be thy guiding light
shine so bright the you will find your way through the darkness of the night

i’m the earth and sky
i’m the low and high
i’m the snowflake in the winter evening
i’m the birth and death
i’m your final breath
i’m the one that gave you life and freedom
choosing your own way
everything you’ve ever known
every seed that you’ve sown
came from me i made you
my creation is supreme
this is all my perfect dream
no mistakes
in god’s great “perfect” cosmic play
i’m the alpha i’m the omega
i’m the beginning and the end of time
i’m the alpha i’m the omega
my whole creation stands before me tonight
i’m the dark and light
i’m the day and night
i’m the mirage
i’m the echo
i’m fear and anger
i’m a familiar stranger
i’m the shadow i’m a star that guides you
until the end of time
buried alive wrapped in skin
from another human
that is still alive
why must i die this way?
draped in a blood-soaked covering
my suffering a mystery
in the ground barely conscious
unknown graveyard of the ancients
is where it all will end
sacrificial tomb of torment
excruciating pain to covet
obtain a new eternal home
wearing the shroud made of membrane
cerements of the flayed
cloaked in the peeled epidermis
cerements of the flayed
unburied to live wrapped in skin
from another human
that was still alive
why didn't i die this way?
draped in a blood-soaked covering
my suffering a mystery
up from the ground barely conscious
a new chapter is upon us
when will it all end?
must endure the grisly torment
exhilarating pain to covet
obtain a new external hide
wearing the shroud made of membrane
cerements of the flayed
cloaked in the peeled epidermis
cerements of the flayed
shaved of my own pelt
replaced ceremoniously
salvaged from oblivion
regained life through atrocity
repulsively existing
perpetual form of agony
scraped into an endless hell
slice meticulously
exterior invasion
sickening form of misery
succumbing to the mayhem
shocking all humanity
wearing the shroud made of membrane
cerements of the flayed
cloaked in the peeled epidermis
cerements of the flayed
of the flayed
of the flayed
of the flayed
of the flayed
years were going like sand exposed to morning wind
slowly hopes left place to dreams
past and future all at once everything has gone
take your time to say goodbye
to my life... in a single chance i try
to my fears... 'cause i've seen' em day by day
somewhere in my dreams i can see
lying the colours of my world
where my spirit sometimes falls
and i wonder if there's a way to paint these walls
with the colours of my world living deep inside my soul?
all that world around me suffocated my will
in that grey i slowly chilled
there with nothing winding me sometimes i felt so old
like a man who lived for too long
a hundred years... i surrender to my fears
a thousand years... whish i could forget my tears
somewhere in my dreams i can see
lying the colours of my world
where my spirit sometimes falls
and i wonder if there's a way to paint these walls
with the colours of my world living deep inside my soul?
now i'm here sitting in a corner of an empty room
with pearled eyes
"in my mind the silence, immobility of a frozen gloom"
in a stolen smile
through the veils
of human unconsciousness
reside the nameless words we are not allowed to know
would i break this veil?
that's where my mind has gone
a trip with no return
through the meaning of what we call... life
...what we call... life...
...what we call... life...
...what we call... life...
somewhere in my dreams i can see
lying the colours of my world
where my spirit sometimes falls
and i wonder if there's a way to paint these walls
with the colours of my world living deep inside my soul?

instructions - rule your day

"but you won't realize,"
it's hidden far too deep!
manipulation of your opinion
to turn you in a brainwashed ant
that follows the stream of losers
you're misused they pretend!

sooner or later we'll meet the maker
it doesn't matter to me
'cos i'll be laughing while i'm packing
they'll have to drag me away
i've been around i've been inside out
i've seen it all before
i've had my share of lady luck
knocking at my door
i'd give it all away (*)
i'd give it all away
just for one more day
one more day with you
if you ever see the devil
you gotta tell him from me
i got an angel a little angel
living right here with me
i've been across and i've been to the edge
i've seen it all before
i've had my share of lady luck
knocking at my door
the rising
and the earth begins to shake
a company uproaring
anxiety growing
cheers are leaving this moral life behind
sweat begins to downpour
a riot we stand for
the blackout foreshadows the chaos
so raise your voices with me
and sing this song of unity
so raise your hands up with me
and hold this moment eternally
like a rift open in the sky
through fire pulses a lightning
while thundering sounds ring
tempting us to leave lifes troubles behind
it's time to stick together
it's just so much better
than life could ever offer
so raise your voices with me
and sing this song of unity
so raise your hands up with me
and hold this moment eternally
so raise your voices with me
and sing this song of unity
so raise your hands up with me
and hold this moment eternally
so raise your voices with me
and sing this song of unity
so raise your hands up with me
and hold this moment eternally
so raise your voices with me
and sing this song of unity
so raise your hands up with me
and hold this moment eternally

the ordeal has begun
"to oblige the unknown, within me"
as i drown
"cannot remember, cannot think"
"as i sink, deep..."
near the monolith of doubt creeps the fear
the fear to lose yourself
in the severe reflection
i don’t know
a flashing moment that has frozen me
my whole existence passed by
through the trusted eyes of a mirror
but it wasn’t me i could see
this monolith of everything that i have been
is vacillated and aghast
the inexorable time has taught me once again
that my features will change and macerate me
"see, it’s me, my monolith of doubt"

i can feel the music of my age
it's paranoid...first degree
tellin' me that i'm not free
i've got heavy metal music in my blood
and i'd like to give it to you if i could
as i lie in the shroud of darkness
the wings of light remove the veil

heavy metal mania all the way
rock 'n roll...far too slow
so the adrenaline just doesn't flow
"where is the power, where is the glory?"
heavy metal is my story
it's a pretty thing there to hold your head
it's like the sanity is hanging on a thread
the flesh is cold and needs young nails
"and the look you give, it never fails"
i love the way you hurt me
i love that you don't care
my love is dark and twisted
and i scream when you're not there
"it's the interesting way, it fills my brain"
it's been beneath my eyes
it's been never the same
i love it when you're heavy and crack a smile
the best is when you make it last a while
last it a while
i love the way you hurt me
i love that you don't care
my love is dark and twisted
and i scream when you're not there
can't seem to get away
this ghost i'll never find
it haunts me 'til this day
i can't get back my mind
i love the way you hurt me
i love that you don't care
my love is dark and twisted

i'll lead you
close to the lord of the dark powers
no rest
no end
no shelter
no escape
no respite
no sleep
all your life you're bin slipping and sliding
trying to find a way
sun won't shine but now it's your time to pay
there's no turning back as you look
the hangman in the eye
now hell's just your death away
it's too late to say you care
when there's evil in your stare
you say you're not to blame
in your head voices mocking
every prayer
remember the face you saw
that once was you
spirit high there's no way that
you could lose
give him rope they said
as you look the hangman in
the eye
now around your neck you feel
the noose
in your head voices mocking
every prayer
now you're lost forever
i'm burning with fire it's time to
leave or get out
i'm burning in fire i can't take
no more so get out
i'm burning with fire the wheels of
steel will grind you
burning in fire this time
you're lost forever
lost forever!
there's an evil in your stare
lost forever!
and hell's just a breath away
you're lost forever
and there's no way out you burn
with fire it's time to get out
"get out, get out"
and there's no way out
lost forever
blessed visionary cut me with your sun
the rivers ran in blood
spark fueled to fire
deep within this endless void
searching for a sign
the vessel forged inside me
watches over like the death
of the moon
strike the shepherd
sheep will scatter
mountains of despair
i can see the pain
its written all over your face
the screaming arrows tear through my soul
in the dawn your face is haunting
white ghostly dreams
weight of worlds is on your shoulders
hear the voice of gold
i can see the pain
its written all over your face
desperate heathens flock to sirens
guard your heartache well
momma don't let them take her
don't let them take her down
please tell lucifer he can't have this one
her spirits too strong
i can see the pain
its written all over your face
i can see the pain
you can make it all go away
i've had nothing but bad luck
since the day i saw the cat at my door
"so i came here to you, sweet lady"
answering your mystical call
crystal ball on the table
"showing the future, the past"
same cat with them evil eyes
and i knew it was a spell she'd cast.
she's just a devil woman
with evil on her mind
beware the devil woman
she's gonna get you
she's just a devil woman
with evil on her mind
beware the devil woman
she's gonna get you from behind.
give me the ring on your finger
let me see the lines of your hand
i can see me a tall dark stranger
giving you what you hadn't planned
i drank the potion she offered me
i found myself on the floor
then i looked in those big green eyes
and i wondered what i came there for.
she's just a devil woman
with evil on her mind
beware the devil woman
she's gonna get you
she's just a devil woman
with evil on her mind
beware the devil woman
she's gonna get you from behind.
stay awake! look out!
if you're out on a moonlit night
be careful of the neighbourhood strays
of a lady with long black hair
tryin' to win you with her feminine ways
crystal ball on the table
"showing the future, the past"
same cat with them evil eyes
you'd better get out of there fast!
she's just a devil woman
with evil on her mind
beware the devil woman
she's gonna get you.
let's go!
"what's the problem, why can't you relax?"
instigating on everything that makes me mad
love is scary and love is to blame
"yes, i lurve you and that is the shame"
i'm over you
over you
over you
over you
over you
over you
over you
let's go!
i'm taking over
won't you let us trade?
life's like a landslide
gotta get away
the solution i try to reveal
but the question is how can you really be real?
"life is scary, and hate is pain"
"god, i need you and that is the shame"
i need you
i need you
i need you
i need you
i need you
i need you
i need you
let's go!
i'm taking over
won't you let us trade?
life's like a landslide
gotta get away
gotta get away
"can't, can't get away"
gotta get away
"can't, can't get away"
gotta get away
"can't, can't get away"
gotta get away
"can't, can't get away"
gotta get away
"can't, can't get away"
gotta get away
"can't, can't get away"
gotta get away
"can't, can't get away"
gotta get away
"can't, can't get away"
lets go!
i'm taking over
won't you let us trade?
life's like a landslide
gotta get away

"it's a loaded dice, that you throw this time,"
"if you turn the ace, it'll turn out fine,"
"when you spin the wheel, and you get your call,"
"south of the line, well the loser gets it all."
"one too many days, one too many nights,"
"you cried too many tears, had too many fights,"
"and you know it's a bad time, bad time to lose."
god knows there's no good time.
"too many days, and too many nights,"
"you cried too many tears, had too many fights,"
"and you know it's a bad time, bad time to lose,"
"yeah, yeah, bad time to lose."
you're breaking a chain
lying until you can erase the past
born with a look of deceit
praying that all the bitter guilt's defeated
born...
"stand on your own, killed from behind"
"fools are blind, unwilling to accept, decline..."
you'll turn a blind eye...
bought by a sickening man
the weakened gather as fast as they can
'whore' is what people roar
"from fear of rejection,"
you'll come back for more
"strong, don't see that love has ceased"
"in the end, only death release.."
"stand on your own, killed from behind"
throw away my dreams
this fight for my life isn't getting behind me
and i've been told to scream
"where no one can hear me, it doesn't mean nothing"
so make me believe
just take me away from this hell i've created
and i'm afraid
i'm breaking my own vows knowing i'll go down in flames
i know this can't be right
there's got to be something more that i can live for
and i can only hide
inside of this sickness for so long again
so make me believe
just take me away from this hell i've created
and i'm afraid
i'm breaking my own vows knowing i'll go down
make me believe
just take me away from temptation that's calling me
and i'm afraid
i'm breaking my own vows knowing i'll go down in flames
running in circles
confusion is calling my name
hiding inside of this poisoning madness again
"i'm tired, i'm broken"
i'm walking along with the dead
will i ever feel like i once did?
so make me...
make me believe
just take me away from this hell i've created
and i'm afraid
i'm breaking my own vows knowing i'll go down
make me believe
make me believe
make me believe
"i'm breaking my own vows, knowing i'll go down in flames"
i remember all your promises
i remember all your words
you told me life could change for the better
i shouldn’t believe in what i heard
in a blink of an eye everything happens
be patient now...
where have the angels gone
where are all the miracles they've done
can you answer me now
i wanna know
counting the hours i've been waiting
counting the lies that i've been told
am i the only one who's searching
searching for a miracle of gold...
in a blink of an eye....
time!
has come to wash our shame away
to erase the image of defeat
we!
"have licked our wounds,restored our strength"
and our vengeance will be oh so sweet
they thought they had us down
that we'd never rise again
they will learn that they were deadly wrong
what's owed will be repaid
again we'll feed the wolves
and then vengeance will be ours
we'll split their skulls and spill their guts
upon the frozen ground
"yeah,we'll never kneel again"
not to deity nor men
now they'll taste our bitter hate
what's owed will be repaid
so raise the flag once more
and the eagle will be fed
once again we march to war
for victory or death
they arrived with talk of hvitekrist
by force they wanted us to kneel
with their swords held to our throats they preached
but we will make them pay we'll take their lives away
so raise!
raise the flag once more
in the east the eagle will be fed
march!
again we march to war
we will march for victory or death
pain!
the pain and suffering
is but a bleak and distant fading dream
shame!
our disgrace; a withering thought
finally our names will be redeemed
shot rings out
hear somebody scream
nightmare
caught up in a fantasy
tied up
fear's workin' overtime
wrecks my sanity
lay down
ear touched the floor
telephone rings
it's someone at the door
it's alright
just the paperboy
hear with the magazines
can't you see i'm
right on the edge
on the verge
of going crazee
my whole life's been livin'
right on the edge
don't you try and stop me
life is drivin' me insane
lights out
can't see a damn thing
shot down
eyes of a hurricane
it's all wrong
stumble outa bed
reach for a cigarette
busted
runnin' in the dead of nite
locked up
back of a black and white
too late
gotta pay the price
luck's runnin' out again
can't you see i'm
right on the edge
on the verge
of going crazee
my whole life's been livin'
right on the edge
don't you try and stop me
life is drivin' me insane
these aren't the days that will
tell the stories all
living on the days of the fallen
a voice that once spoke of strength and hope
nothing's addict of the hopeless
you cannot break
this love we hate
a tribute to the fallen
your choice is made
to go your way
a tribute to the fallen
"we done, you done, we raised"
and with new strenght
no we just begun
to fight this war with you
you cannot break
this love we hate
a tribute to the fallen
your choice is made
to go your way
a tribute to the fallen
walk the path you're choosing
our fear remains unbroken
even if we die tonight
this is an endless fight
our spirits will fall
in the hearts of those we leave behind
"broken bones, and the will of stone"
in the end we will not stand alone
you cannot break
this love we hate
a tribute to the fallen
your choice is made
to go your way
a tribute to the fallen
my entrance purely pleasure
for your riches i ask you not
for i am the gleeman
who loves to sing
and strike upon my golden harp
so i bow before you o mighty king
in the hopes you hear my song
these feet have traveled far and wide
in a life lived for the song
i claim no land my home
for i know not where i'm from
traveled mountain peaks
and valleys low
in a life for the son of a bard
raise your harp my friend
for the song that burns
in your heart
sing of the heroes
and the days that time forgot
sing of the days of the earls and
the kings and the knights
that conquered great feats
for these are the things
that we all dream
but only your eyes have seen
i've traveled these war lands deep
raging the knights in shining armor
surely death awaits the weak
i've sailed the viking vessels
plunging the northern seas
crossing the blue horizon
no land for the eye to see
for the eye to see
raise your harp my friend
for the song that burns
in your heart
sing of the heroes
and the days that time forgot
sing of the days of the earls
and the kings and the knights
that conquered great feats
for these are the things
that we all dream
low and high
slow motion
we reason at the sound of a big band traveling
in time
overwhelmed by all we've seen
"wealthy, healthy"
ready...
above
as below
surrounding a view
above as below
the world is unreal...
sweet
violence
rough tenderness
an ode to movement
"endless, uncontrolled"
caresses
overwhelmed by all we've seen
overwhelmed by all we've been
"wealthy, healthy"
ready...
above as below
surrounding a view
above as
below
the world is unreal...
born in the window
cold blooded spoof
raised in the prison
you called the school
taught young in legends
told what to do
i handed my childhood
over to you
"travelling endlessly, i'm searching for mind"
i'm almost afraid of what i will find
"wandering aimlessly, oh what can i do?"
"i handed my future over to you, to you"
over to you
future looks blue
what can i do?
watching for freedom
fighting our wars
feeding our children
keeping your laws
someday you'll suffer
and what i'll do
i'll hand all your promises
over to you
"standing inside myself, i'm losing control"
you made me believe in the stories you told
"waiting impatiently, what else can i do?"
"i handed my future over to you, to you"
over to you
future looks blue
what can i do?
tears filled of sadness
stealing myself
which burning secrets?
what to they tell?
mad politicians
can tell it true
i handed my children
over to you
"all over, over to you"
"all over, over to you"
"all over, over to you..."
heaven knows
heaven knows i tried
to be like you
to be a part of you tribe
i'd rather leave it all behind
but that's alright
i'm not your average type
no mr. clean - hey i wanna be me
can't you see - i'm the exception to the rule
i know what i want
and i know i'm gonna get it
that is why - i'm the exception to the rule
don't push me too far
the way i am is just because
i don't wanna be like you
i don't wanna be like you
the walls can be shaking
the earth could be quaking
i still don't wanna be like you
i'm hog-tied'n'dirty
i'm tough and mean
keep your wall street slickers
and the american dream
you ('ve) done me over and over
you ('ve) tried to tie me down
why don't you step out of the shadows
dare to roll the dice
let it roll - and don't you push me around
can't you see - i'm the exception to the rule
i know what i want
and i know i'm gonna get it
that is why - i'm the exception to the rule
don't push me too far
the way i am is just because
i don't wanna be like you
i don't wanna be like you - never ever !
the walls can be shaking
the earth could be quaking
but i still don't wanna be like you
the ordinary way of life ain't for me
i do what i want and i wanna be free
"never know, where i go or what i'm gonna do"
why can't you see - the only thing i know is that
i don't wanna be like you
i don't wanna be like you
if the oceans turn to desert
hell can turn to ice
but i still don't wanna be like you
i don't wanna be like you
i don't wanna be like you - no way !
the walls can be shaking
the earth could be quaking
but i still don't wanna be like - you !
the show is over
still hear the ringing in your ears
another day on the road and no time for fears
the lights turned off
the stage is cleared and empty
the energy level you had turned down completely
hots night of thunder
all fist up in the air
we are the wild creation
and we will rock this town
we gonna rock the nation
so shout it out loud
a thousand miles away from home
you're locked inside the circus
strage fright you try to stay cool and not getting nervous
"the countdown starts, few seconds to go, all hell breaks loose"
and you're giving all that you can and sometimes even more
hots night of thunder
all fist up in the air
we are the wild creation
and we will rock this town
we gonna rock the nation
so shout it out loud
we are no strange sensation
but wanna teach you loud
we gonna rock the nation
and there is no doubt
this is your life and it means all to you
this is your time for breaking the rules
we are the wild creation
and we will rock this town
we gonna rock the nation
so shout it out loud
we are no strange sensation
but wanna teach you loud
we gonna rock the nation
and there is no doubt
"life endures, it serenades"
obliteration through wars
unholy fire seduces
the undead lust withstands
"for the fire burns, deep within mistrust"
"for the ghosts, the ones to break me"
for jesus christ
for jesus christ
"life is charged, prepared in rage"
fooled generations no more
unholy fire reduces
the undead lust demands
"for the fire burns, deep within mistrust"
"for the ghosts, the ones to break me"
for jesus christ
for jesus christ
could you feel the same?
would you feel the pain?
for the fire burns deep within mistrust
"for the ghosts, the ones to break me"
for jesus christ
for jesus christ
"all tears, restrained for years"
their grief is confined
which destroys my mind
an ode to their plight is this dirge
some yearn for lugubrious silence
serenity in the image of the coffins
shall life renew these bodies of a truth?
"all death will he annul, all tears assuage?"
"fill the void veins of life, again with youth"
"and wash with an immortal water, age"
they die.
children gather round him
mystery surrounds him
what terrible secret does he hide
an ordinary man
doing what he can
but what goes on inside his mind
the night draws nigh
with darkened sky's
"axe blade shines,"
midnight chimes
morning comes around
headless bodies found
our little friend just sits and smiles ha ha
take them home and love them
read the bible to them
be sure to kiss each one goodnight
but come the night
you'll freeze with fright
axe drawn high
another dies
creeping and searching for victims unknowing
what fate doth await round each corner
the take in the night
he's got you in his sight
now that i have warned you
always look behind you
you'll never know just who'll be there
that harmless looking dear
may be the one to fear
so never trust those you don't know
but come the night
you'll freeze with fright
axe drawn high
the bastards die
in the name of god
we didn't know for sure
that evil is right outside our door
and now all the bad and ugly
showing their faces more
so now we have got to work it out
and think with precision
make sure we make the right decision
in the name of god
in the name of god
in the name of god
together we're standing tall
together we will never fall
together we're living free
and the truth is all for all to see
but since we've all been blinded
blinded by evil
now is the time to stand and fight
in the name of god
in the name of god
in the name of god
in the name of god
in the name of god
in the name of god
in the name of god
a moment in time independent from the rest
a platform disconnected from formal ground
a life inside the life inconsequential but real
wondering who can tell the truth
too far to one side takes you to the other side
i can tell you 'bout my own truth
too far one way takes you the other way
and i slip inside
a world in stand-by while life goes on
stop is a start in suspended time
whatever has been left behind
keep on feeding the suspended time
a possibility explored but not developed
a visited fantasy excluded from history
a personal snapshot or a private play
an alternative nest of living memory
wondering who can tell the truth
too far to one side takes you to the other side
i can tell you 'bout my own truth
too far one way takes you the other way
and i slip inside
a world in stand-by while life goes on
stop is a start in suspended time
whatever has been left behind
keep on feeding the suspended time
a hyphen between you and i
between here and there
between in and out
between up and down
a world in stand-by while life goes on
stop is a start in suspended time
whatever has been left behind
keep on feeding the suspended time
i'm a monster so don't walk my way.
don't trust my smile my teeth are like knives.
i'll drag you down and suck you dry.
don't laugh at my jokes- the punchline is murder.
"don't enjoy my touch, every caress hides a chokehold."
i'm only happy when i've ruined everything i see.
believe everything you've ever heard about me- suck it up.
"if you see me coming don't stop, just turn and walk the other way."
"i will not lie about what i have done,"
"i will not lie about what i will do to you,"
children of satan it's time to bring pain
stand by your side when the christians engaged
angelic pastures is where we will war
once and for all we will settle the score
"in the presence of god, holy crosses inverted"
retribution for what has been done by the churches
with no warning the word of the lord is in question
preservation of life ever more
floating (inatankofhatredfuel) with nowhere to hide
unspoken (10000thousandthoughtsanhourandrising) twist back inside
how did we get here
life don't belong here
feel like i just never tried
to find a way back to the outside
it stops me from breathing
kills all the dreaming
talking to you from the other side of a wall
in my mind and it's clear that you're near to me.
think i found a way to understand why i couldn't see what
was happening the fear overcame me.took a trip on the inside
i took a trip on the inside i try to hold on 'til this feeling
is gone.break through to the other side need to break through
to the other side of everything...
i just can't lay down and die
it takes a lifetime to understand why
it seems that you need me
but you don't seem to hear me
talking to you from the other side of a
wall...sickshitsickshitsickshitsickshitsickshitsick shit....
symbolical and mystical
between life and death we're torn
a constant struggle
like an apocrypha
nobody can be certain
"a thousand days, spent in hell"
the ultimate sacrifice
your voyage starts
with a question mark
but the distant future
will not tell
bury me an angel
set my black soul free!!
blackened chariots
bearing evil souls
ride the surface of burning holes
nocturnal... …traveller
you represent the ruined spirit
symbolical and mystical
you shall be damned for all time
now we're on the journey
back into darker times
can you see the man made mountains
they were built for those divine
we walk into the twilight
in the land of the dead
when the gods walked the earth
in the city of a thousand gates
they were kings from birth
that was their given fate
in the valley of kings
where the echoes still ring
on the hot desert winds
in the valley of kings
their souls that are immortal
within their after life
their soaring through the portal
to be eternal light
they were ruling without mercy
reigning life on earth
when the gods walked the earth
in the city of a thousand gates
they were kings from birth
that was their given fate
in the valley of kings
where the echoes still ring
on the hot desert winds
in the valley of kings
when the gods walked the earth
in the city of a thousand gates
they were kings from birth
that was their given fate
in the valley of kings
where the echoes still ring
on the hot desert winds
in the valley of kings
mirror can you tell me
how to stay forever young
let me know the secret
i will hold my twisted tongue
