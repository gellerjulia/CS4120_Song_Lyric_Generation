only a tramp was lazarus sad fate
he who lay down at the rich man 's gate
he begged for the crumbs from the rich man to
he was only a tramp found dead on the street
"he was some mother 's darlin ' , he was"
once he was fair and once he was young
"and some mother rocked him , her darlin ' to"
but they left him to die like a tramp on
"jesus , he died on calvary 's tree"
he shed his life 's blood for you and for
they pierced his side and then his feet
and they left him to die like a tramp on
"he was mary 's own darlin ' , he was"
once he was fair and once he was young
"mary , she rocked him , her darlin ' to"
but they left him to die like a tramp on
if jesus should come and knock on your door
"for a place to come in , or bread from"
"would you welcome him in , or turn him away"
then the god 's would deny you on the great
christmas time again
"the perfect end , to a not-so-perfect year"
at last it 's here
hustle bustle to and fro
"from store to store , to get one more"
of whatever is in style this year
on the marquee sign at 5 and 9
"the latest movie shows , and it starts to snow"
children look into the sky
to see if reindeer really fly
who knows
but when it comes down to this season
above it all there 's still a reason
to just look up
a star is born tonight
come to make things right
"angels singing , anthems ringing"
glory to the king
a star is born tonight
"silent holy night , heaven 's sacred light"
shines all around
and joy resounds
in manger hay the baby jesus came to seek
and save the lost
until they 're found
peace on earth a new beginning
he 's the gift that keeps on giving
to all of us
a star is born tonight
"( choir ) glory hallelujah , glory to the king"
come to make things right
( choir ) merry christmas to you all the joy
"angels singing , anthems ringing"
glory to the king
a star is born tonight
"angels singing , anthems ringing"
glory to the king

summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times
for the times i miss you most of all are
i used to cry out in the middle of the
baby hold me tight

when i opened my eyes
now i 've turned a corner on those days and
and something inside me is changing
i think i might be starting over
and i do n't wan na run
"oh no 'cause you might be the one , baby"
if ever i could love
i think it could be with you
if ever i thought i 'd
found somebody so true
i wonder if you feel
the same way that i do
if ever i could love
i think it could be with you
you know i ca n't read your mind my love
but it seems to me
that your heart and mine tonight are
defying gravity
there 's something so familiar and still so unknown
but the closer that we get i swear it feels
coming home
and i 'm ready to be brave
"oh yeah then you look at me and say ,"
if ever i could love
i think it could be with you
if ever i thought i 'd
found somebody so true
i wonder if you feel
the same way that i do

"when she walked out of my life ,"
i got hurt so bad i swore i 'd never
get inside this heart of mine
but you touched my hand and every plan that i
disappeared like a falling star
and there 's a new beginning and i 'm
movin ' to the rhythm of a beating braver heart
i 've been a fool i 've been a fool
forgivin ' you each time that you 've done me
i 've been a long time leavin ' but i
loved you so much i loved you so much
i stayed around when i should 've moved along
i 've been a long time leaving but i 'll

"i was lost in the wild side of life ,"
i was blinded by smoke and neon lights .
i was drinkin ' and sinkin ' without a prayer
then she showed up right out of thin air .
"she took me to heaven , oh my lord ,"
"and i 've never been higher , on her love"
"i was hellbound , on my way down , then"
"oh , an angel loved the devil out of me"
i thank god for her love each day .
he saved me when he sent her my way .
"now each night , i drive by those neon lights"
and go home to my own paradise .
"where she takes me to heaven , oh my lord"
"and i 've never been higher , on her love"
"i was hellbound , on my way down , then"
"oh , an angel loved the devil out of me"
oh yes she did .
though the sun may be dawning
you 're the one that lights the morning
as i awake to the heaven
of your sweet summer lovin '
by a stream in the country
running barefoot and feeling free
while the love in our hearts blend
into sweet summer lovin '
sweet summer lovin ' in the dandelions
sweet summer lovin ' keeps me high as candy wine
when that big red balloon sets
like a painting across the west
as the sky turns a crimson blue
as the world turns for me and you
by the light of the moon glowing
while the warm summer wind blows
'cross the sill of your window
we 'll be letting our love flow
sweet summer lovin ' in the dandelions
sweet summer lovin ' keeps me high as candy wine
sweet summer lovin ' in the dandelions
sweet summer lovin ' keeps me high as candy wine
sweet summer lovin '
sweet summer lovin '
mmm ...
sweet summer lovin '
mmm ...
sweet summer lovin '
i love your sweet summer lovin '
sweet summer lovin '
sweet summer lovin '

they packed up all his buckles
and shipped his saddle to his dad
and by the way the house looked
she must have took it bad
the workers come on monday
to fix the door and patch the wall
they say she just went crazy
the night she got the call
he was up in wyoming
and drew a bull no man could ride
he promised her he 'd turn out
well it turned out that he lied
and their dreams that they 'd been livin '
in the california sand
died right there beside him in cheyenne
they she just went crazy
screamin ' out his name
she ran out into the ocean
and to this day they claim
that if you go down by the water
you 'll see her footprints in the sand
'cause every night she walks the beaches of cheyenne
they never found her body
just her diary by her bed
it told about the fight they had
and the words that she had said
when he told her he was ridin '
she said then i do n't give a damn
if you never come back from cheyenne
they she just went crazy
screamin ' out his name
she ran out into the ocean
and to this day they claim
that you can go down by the water
and see her footprints in the sand
'cause every night she walks the beaches of cheyenne
nobody can explain it
some say she 's still alive
they even claim they 've seen her
on the shoreline late at night
so if you go down by the water
you 'll see her footprints in the sand
'cause every night she walks the beaches of cheyenne
every night she walks the beaches of cheyenne

it 's a sin to make me cry
when you know i love you so
i could tell my heart that i do n't miss
my lips could tell a lie but my heart would

to help me deal with this abuse
if french fries were fat free
and you still love me
if french fries were fat free
and you still love me
what a wonderful world this would be
if the whiskey really helped me
forget your memory
i 'd wear a smile endlessly
if french fries were fat free
and you still love me
you know the more i think about you
the more sense it makes
cause grease and love both cause heartache
so i raise my glass and toast
these things i want the most
though i probably never see
i ca n't help but believing
that if french fries were fat free
and you still love me
what a wonderful world this would be
if the whiskey really helped me
forget your memory
i 'd wear a smile endlessly
if french fries were fat free
and you still love me
oh if french fries were fat free
and you still love me

do not fear
when i 'm on deck
a bigger lie i 've never told
a bigger story yet to unfold
my only guarantee : i will fuck you up
another day
of pure energy
what wears most
is the constancy
a bigger job i 've never had
a bigger burden i could not drag
my only guarantee : i will fuck you up
strange how things
come about
will i ever know
how things turn out
a bigger wish i 've never known
a bigger question i 'm trying to hone
my only guarantee : i will fuck you up

if my heart was just the destination
she had herself one hell of a vacation
if my kiss was just the main attraction
she wore it out like it was going out of
if my touch was just some kind of ride
then she loved that roller-coaster
i guess she came down from that high
"when it was over , it was over"
she did what she came to do
saw what she came to see
took a good look around
made her some memories
never been there before
she crossed it off the map
pedal down to the floor
now she ai n't coming back
that 's the last i 'll see of her
she 's been there
got the t-shirt
i wonder if she 'll just throw it in the
or keep it out and tell her friends
just how she got it
"i wonder if she 's sleeping in it ,"
dreaming in it
i wonder if she knows what she did to me
she did what she came to do

got the t-shirt
with stones on the front
tour dates on the back
took it when she left

she did what she came to do
saw what she came to see
took a good look around
made her some memories
never been there before
she crossed it off the map

bonnie was a waitress in a small cafe
clyde barrow was the rounder that took her away
they both robbed and killed until both of them died
so goes the legend of bonnie and clyde .
the poems that she wrote of the life that they
told of the lawmen left dying or dead
some say that clyde made her life a shame
but the legend made bonnie the head of the game
the rampage grew wilder with each passing day
the odds growing smaller with each get-a-way
with the end growing closer the harder they fought
with blood on their hands they were bound to get
they drove back from town on one bright summer day
when a man they befriended stepped out in the way
with no thought of dyin ' they pulled to the
but death lay there waiting for bonnie and clyde .
two years or runnin ' was ended that day
for robbin ' and killin ' they both had to
but we 'll always remember how they lived and died
so goes the legend of bonnie and clyde .
i set out on a narrow way
many years ago
hoping i would find true love
along the broken road
but i got lost a time or two
wiped my brow and kept pushing through
could n't see how every sign
pointed straight to you
every long lost dream
led me to where you are
others who broke my heart
they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way
into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to
led me straight to you
others who broke my heart
they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way
into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to you
( yes it did )
i think about the years i spent
just passing through
i 'd like to have the time i lost
and give it back to you
but you just smiled and take my hand
you 've been there you understand
it 's all part of a grander plan
that is coming true
every long lost dream
led me to where you are
others who broke my heart
they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way
into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me strait to
led me straight to you
others who broke my heart
they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way
into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to you
( yeah )
now i 'm just rolling home
into my lover 's arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that lead me straight to you
that god blessed the broken road
that lead me straight to you

halos and horns
writer dolly parton
"halos and horns , sinners and saints ,"
hearts that are torn between what 's wrong and ai
just because it feels right does not make it so
so we struggle through life in horns and halos
tempted and tried with each step we take
"we stumble and slide and make our mistakes ,"
ask god to forgive us for all of our sins
then we take off our horns and wear halos again
"halos and horns , sinners and saints ,"
hearts that are torn between what 's wrong and ai
just because it feels right does not make it so
so we struggle through life in horns and halos
"halos and horns , sinners and saints ,"
"we 're praised or we 're scorned , we either"
"oh , but life is a challenge from the day"
just tryin ' to balance halos and horns
"it 's heaven or hell , halos or horns"
"halos and horns , sinners and saints ,"
hearts that are torn between what 's wrong and ai
"but just because it feels right ; well , that"
so we struggle through life in horns or halos
it 's either horns or halos

there 's a key in a letter unopened
buried back in an old dresser drawer
there 's a name stained with tears on that letter
one that i 'm sure i 've never seen before
there 's no date on that letter unopened
my guess is it 's faded with years
and i ca n't sleep at night now for wonderin
how long has that secret been hiding here
"did you love someone , lose someone"
leave someone waiting
is there somebody 's heart out there
you could have taken
the letter says it all
though the words go unspoken
you loved me enough to leave it unopened
there 's a love that is trust without reason
there 's a faith that leaves questions unasked
and though my heart has searched for the answer
i love you too much for these lips to ask
"did you love someone , lose someone"
leave someone waiting
is there somebody 's heart out there
you could have taken
the letter says it all
though the words go unspoken
you loved me enough to leave it unopened
"oh , the letter says it all"
though the words go unspoken

the sign said `` 40 miles to canada ''
my truck tore across montana
ian tyson singing 'lonesome lullaby '
and so i cranked up the radio
'cause there 's just a little more to go
before i cross the border at that sweet grass sign
i 'm alberta bound
this peace of heaven that i 've found
rocky mountains and black fertal ground
"everything i need , beneath that big blue sky"
it does n't matter where i go
this place will always be my home
i have been alberta bound for all my life
and i 'll be alberta bound until i die
it 's a pride that 's been passed down to
deep as coal mines
wide as farmer 's fields
"yeah , i 've got independence in my veins"
maybe it 's my down home redneck roots
or these dusty old alberta boots
but like the chinook wind keeps coming back again
i 'm alberta bound
this piece of heaven that i 've found
rocky mountains and black fertal ground
"everything i need , beneath that big blue sky"
it does n't matter where i go
this place will always be my home
"yeah , i 've been alberta bound for all my"
and i 'll be alberta bound until i die
"oh , it does n't matter where i go"
this place will always be my home
i have been alberta bound for all my life
and i 'll be alberta bound until i die

full moon friday night after the game
stars must have all lined up early that day
"i just turned 17 , she had me by a"
"we were young , we were green to the taste"
from that very first kiss
it was like we were born for that moment
caught up in the perfect storm
it came in like a flood over the gate
swallowed us up and it swept us away
"we were over our heads , me and that girl"
"we were out of our minds , it was out"
"it was always too much , it was never enough"
it was just the kind of stuff you just ca
it was love
we reigned like the king and the queen of the
everyone wanted some of what we had then
"yeah , we were the ones they all talked about"
like we were the fire that would never go out
it came in like a flood over the gate
swallowed us up and it swept us away
"we were over our heads , me and that girl"
"we were out of our minds , it was out"
"it was always too much , it was never enough"
it was just the kind of stuff you just ca
it was love
"we knew it was coming , still , it came"
neither one knew what to say or to do
"so , we just let the radio play while we"
we laughed and we cried like i never have since
it came in like a flood over the gate
swallowed us up and it swept us away
"we were over our heads , me and that girl"
"we were out of our minds , it was out"
"it was always too much , it was never enough"
it was just the kind of stuff you just ca
it was love
it was love
it was love
it was just the kind of stuff you just ca

"if a picture paints a thousand words ,"

the words will never show
the you iâ´ve come to know
"if a face could launch a thousand ships ,"
then where am i to go ?

"and when my love for life is running dry ,"
you come and pour yourself on me
"if i could be two places at one time ,"
iâ´d be with you
"tomorrow and today ,"
beside you all the way
if the world should stop revolving
"spinning slowly down to die ,"
iâ´d spend the end with you
"and when the world was through ,"
then one by one the stars would all go out
then you and i would simply fly away
"if a picture paints a thousand words ,"
then why canâ´t i paint you ?
'cause the words could never show
the you iâ´ve come to know
and one by one the stars will all go out
but you and i will simply fly away
we 'll fly away
"who are you ,"
the one for whom i 'd really gladly suffer
"who are you ,"
the one i 'll always love above another
you 're my world
you 're my hope
you 're all my dreams and all my heart
who are you
the one i give my life to
"who are you ,"
who loves as deep as i do
"who are you ,"
who takes me through the flood and through the fire
"who are you ,"
who leads me through the desert and the dry
you 're in my thoughts
you know my mind
"you 're all my things , you 're all my"
who are you
the one i give my life to
"who are you ,"
who loves as deep as i do
"you 're my savior , you 're my center"
my beginning and my end

there 's a reason why
you can look up every night
and every star in heaven 's in its place
there 's a reason why
the full moon pulls up the tide
and waves roll in to a shore that always waits
and just like that
baby you belong
baby you belong
nothing 's ever been so meant to be
or ever felt so right to me
every single part of me believes
baby you belong
"oh , baby you belong"
there really is no mystery
i think anyone can see
that baby you belong with me
there 's a voice inside
and i heard it promise me
when you came along
i know you by heart
like a familiar song
every word is telling me
that the time has finally come
now here you are
and i know for sure
like the sun belongs up in the morning sky

i have battled with the demons for my soul
a
"like a soldier unafraid , stood straight and tall"
e
with strong convictions fought for what i thought was right
d a e
but i wonder when it stands in judgement hall
d a e
will it go down as one too close to call
e
i have faced that cunning ennemy called time
a
for awhile i held him cold and to a draw
e
as he rode away he said another place and day
d a e
'cause you ca n't erase the writing on the wall
d a e
although this one was just too close to call
e
as i wrestled with my deepest fear in life
a
i was captured by the shadows on the wall
e
"i was brave but just the same , i was"
d a e
because now and then the footsteps in the hall
d a e
remind me it was just too close to call
e
i have watched my mind dance too close to the
a
as i stood among the crowd to see it fall
e
sometimes now i cling to what i hope is sanity
d a e
i stagger on this fine like that i walk
d a e
and wonder is it just too close to call
slipping through the trees and it looks so pretty in
"i guess i got carried away , kept you out"
i hope you do n't mind
by the smile i see on your face
"i think you 're havin ' a good time ,"
when i picked you up
knew it would n't be enough
could n't fit it in one night
shoulda told you then
soon as you got in
i 'd be taking my sweet time
i could show you around
all over the town
"whatever you like , girl"

that i 'm just now getting to be somebody that
kick your seat on back cause girl we 're gon

everybody 's had the blues sometimes and
everybody knows the tune .
and everybody knows the way i 'm feelin ' cause

we crossed the wild pecos
we forded the nueces
we swum the guadalupe
and we followed the brazos
red river runs rusty
the wichita clear
but down by the brazos
i courted my dear
"singing li , li , li , le , le"
lend me your hand
"li , li , li , le , le ,"
lend me your hand
"li , li , li , le , le ,"

there 's many a river
that waters the land
now the fair angelina
runs glossy and gliding
the crooked colorado
runs weaving and winding
the slow san antonio
courses and plains
but i never will walk
by the brazos again
she kissed me and she hugged me
and she called me her dandy
the trinity 's muddy
but the brazos quick sandy
she kissed me and she hugged me
and she called me her own
but down by the brazos
she left me alone
now the girls of little river
they 're plump and they 're pretty
the sabine and the sulphur
hold beauties a'many
the banks of the neches
there are girls by the score
but down by the brazos
i 'll wander no more

confetti fallin ' from the sky
my hometown on the 4th of july
a midnight snow on christmas eve
like standin ' up for what you believe
that 's how i feel when i 'm with you
that 's how i feel when i 'm with you
that 's how i feel
that 's how i feel when i 'm with you
"your lucky coat , the first day of fall"
when you wake up laughin ' just because
an old church door that stays wide open
a perfect heart that 's never been broken
that 's how i feel when i 'm with you
every day there 's something new
"to cry about , to laugh about"
those moments i ca n't live without
that 's how i feel
that 's how i feel
when i 'm with you
"oh , sometimes i go walking through fields where we"
long ago in the sweet used to be
"and the flowers still grow , but they do n't"
as they did when you picked them for me
and when i think of you and the love we
how i wish we could go back in time
do you ever think back on old memories like that
or do i ever cross your mind
do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of
"because you miss me , do you darling"
"oh , and do your memories ever take"
you back into another place in time
and do you ever miss the feelings
and the love we shared when you were with me
or do i ever cross your mind
"oh , how often i wish that again i could"
your sweet lips like i did long ago
and how often i long for those two loving arms
that once held me so gentle and close
was walking down the street the other day
a sight came before my eyes
it was a little hippie boy
i must have been twice his size
his appearence typed his strange breed
"gaudy clothes , long stringy hair hanging down"
i 'd seen perhaps a thousand
in my early trips to town
as he walked on beside me on down the block
i noticed no unpleasing smell .
he might have been on the weed or even lsd
but if he was i could n't tell ...
so we walked together that way through this neighborhood .
finally he turned around to me
and he said `` friend we 're a million miles
but you know something ?
we can enjoy the sunshine and the weather .
so why do n't we put our differences aside
and just talk to each other ?
you see this box beneath my arm ?
"to you it 's plain , it has no charm"
but to someone dearest to my heart
this box has played a tragic part
this little one ca n't tell you himself
about his life and how he died .
"but if anyone else could speak for him ,"
i guess i 'm qualified .
this boy was in chicago he did n't know why
he was with his family and friends and he did
you might have been one of those who saw
the struggle there on your television screen
the tragic thing is so much else happened
that no one else could have seen .
a stranger handed this boy a dollar
to do a simple chore
to carry a package to a nearby hotel .
and when he returned he 'd get two more
but when he came back he sort of lost his
"one of them things you ask yourself ,"
how the lord allowed
but when he was found he was like he is
and in his little hand was a crumpled dollar bill
now you can take that dollar
"get four cents on it , compound it quarterly at"
so they can back some hot new tank or atom
"well , what i 'm going to tell you now"
you kind o
so upset
nervous wreck
i ca n't believe she said goodbye
sit and smoke
cry and joke
about these tears in my eyes
how could you do what you gone and done to
i would n't treat a dog the way you treated
but that 's what i get
i 've come to expect it from you
a million times
a million lines and i bought 'em every one
you do n't care
you rip and tear every dream i 've counted on
i guess i should thank my unlucky stars
that i 'm alive
and you 're the way you are
but that 's what i get
i 've come to expect it from you
i could raise hell
but what the hell it would n't do a bit
i can leave
my heart agrees it seems to think that i should
there wo n't be no more next time doing me
you 'll come back this time to find that i
but that 's what you get
you should expect that from me
that 's what i get
i 've come to expect it from you .
when a single mom goes out on a date with
it always winds up being more like a job interview
my momma used to wonder if she 'd ever meet
who would n't find out about me and then turn
and run
i met the man i call my dad when i
he took my mom out to a movie and for
a few months later i remember lying there in bed
i overheard him pop the question and prayed that she
and then all of a sudden
"oh , it seemed so strange to me"
how we went from something 's missing
to a family
lookin ' back all i can say
about all the things he did for me
is i hope i 'm at least half the dad
that he did n't have to be
i met the girl that 's now my wife about
we had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin '
now here i stand surrounded by our family and friends
crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby
and now all of a sudden
it seemed so strange to me
how we 've gone from something 's missing
to a family
lookin ' through the glass i think about the man
that 's standin ' next to me
and i hope i 'm at least half the dad
that he did n't have to be
lookin ' back all i can say
about all the things he did for me
is i hope i 'm at least half the dad
that he did n't have to be
"yeah , i hope i 'm at least half the"
that he did n't have to be
because he did n't have to be
you know he did n't have to be
i do n't want to talk it over anymore
we said it all last night
and time and time again before
you don ’ t know what you put me through
when you walk out the door
and i don ’ t want to talk it over
we lasted ‘ bout a month again this time
i tried to do you right
but you kept steppin ’ over the line
"now you ’ re gone , and it ’ s"
"but it ’ s the best , don ’ t"
cause i don ’ t want to talk it over
each time we try to say “ i love you
and every time we end up right back where we
and i don ’ t want to talk it over
we said it all last night
and time and time again before
you don ’ t know what you put me through
when you walk out the door
and i don ’ t want to talk it over
each time we try to say “ i love you
and every time we end up right back where we
wanting you the way i do
i only want to be with you
and i would go
to the ends of the earth
"â€˜cause , darling"
to me thatâ€™s what
youâ€™re worth
"where you lead , i will follow"
anywhere that you tell me to
"if you need , you need me to be with"
i will follow where you lead
if youâ€™re out on the road
"feeling lonely , and so cold"
all you have to do is call my name
and iâ€™ll be there on the next train
"where you lead , i will follow"
anywhere that you tell me to
"if you need , you need me to be with"
i will follow where you lead
i always wanted a real home
with flowers in the window sill
but if you want to live in new york city
"honey , you know i will"
i never thought i could get satisfaction
from just one man
if anyone can keep me happy
youâ€™re the one who can
"where you lead , i will follow"
anywhere that you tell me to
"if you need , you need to be with you"
i will follow
"where you lead , i will follow"
anywhere that you tell me to
"if you need , you need to be with you"
i will follow where you lead
"oh , yes i will"
"oh , iâ€™m gon na follow where you lead"
iâ€™m gon na follow where you lead
"oh , iâ€™m gon na follow where you lead"
i will follow
i will follow
i hope that i wo n't be that wrong anymore
and maybe i 've learned this time
i hope that i find what i 'm looking for
"the way that it is , in my mind"

when the angels look down from above
they see a very special love
how she makes me do what no one could
she makes me feel good
she makes me feel good
so buddy if you 're feeling down and blue
and your girlfriend treats you bad too

i sailed a schooner round the horn to mexico .
i went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow

but i am living still .
i was a dam builder across the river deep and
where steel and water did collide .
"a place called boulder on the wild colorado ,"
i slipped and fell into the wet concrete below .
they buried me in that great tomb that knows no
but i am still around .
"i 'll always be around , ."
and around and around and around and around .
"and when i reach the other side ,"
i 'll find a place to rest my spirit if
perhaps i may become a highwayman again .

i look into those blue eyes
something happens to me
although i know again tonight
i 'll hear nothing but true lies
true lies will hurt me less than losing you
so darling lie to me
when i get lost in those blue eyes
i should know better than to let you in
we 're just beginning

sent to save me from my dark side
"yeah , the light inside was fading"
but i found salvation when i fell into your eyes
all i know is
"i got your love , i got your love ,"
"yes , i do"

well i 'm blue-collar branded and stuck in a mill
hard work is a way of life for me

shining down to lead me through the night
"oh southern star , how i wish you would shine"
and show me the way to get home
"oh , hey my d.j . friend , would you"
and let my mind just go and drift away
now we all have a dream and a place where

if you loved me half as much as i love
you would n't worry me half as much as you
you 're nice to me when there 's no one
you only build me up to let me down
if you miss me half as much as i miss
you would n't stay away half as much as you
i know that i would never be this blue

that i did n't leave you a long time ago
but many mistakes are the part of my story
heartache by heartache i 've turned you to stone
call me a traveler gon na catch me a train
i wan na see frisco feel the sunhine again
if you want true love you ca n't stand alone
life here together has turned you to stone
i 've held you captive in a life without sunshine
i 've watched the blue in your eyes fade away
all good is gone now no need to continue
destroying each other oh day after day
call me a traveler gon na catch me a train
life here together has turned you to stone

your blue eyes looked so peaceful
while the storm raged on in me
the tears filled up my eyes and now i finally
i 've been livin ' high and mighty
but now i 'm at an all-time low
now i 'm reaching out to hold you
as you turn around to go
i should 've been more careful
i should 've seen the signs
"while all was calm , i guess"
i should 've read between the lines
"so , now i 'm standin ' in the cold"
instead of with you safe and warm
a fool who took your love for granted
in the calm before the storm
"so , i 'm standin ' here alone"
i 've never felt like this before
ca n't believe my heart 's been broken
just like waves against the shore
i could always love and leave them
i was the first one out the door
i ca n't get used to the idea
not being with you anymore
i should 've been more careful
i should 've seen the signs
"while all was calm , i guess"
i should 've read between the lines
"so , now i 'm standin ' in the cold"
instead of with you safe and warm
a fool who took your love for granted
in the calm before the storm
a fool who took your love for granted
"again ,"
at the end of the rainbow
"again ,"
no gold to be found
just this cold unmade bed
the last 3 words you said
and this buzzing on the telephone line
"paris , well , there is fog on the seine"
amsterdam still courses through my veins
"all these dark crazy sights ,"
would n't be so bad
if i could just taste your breath once again
honey i saw your daddy
lying by the roadside
his feet sticking out of a sack
honey they 'll be calling
to tell you that your daddy
never will be coming back
again
at the end of the rainbow
"again ,"
no words to be found
just this voice sad and alone
me wishing i was home
and the silence on the telephone line
i walked out to the graveyard
down by the church of god
i looked upon the one i love
that would soon be covered with sod
up along the ohio river
over on the old kentucky shore
once dwelled a fair young maiden
now there 's a crepe upon her door
the angels took my darling
god needed the one i loved
i reached the old kentucky shore today
i 'll make my plans and meet her up above
the last words that my darling said
was tell the one i love goodbye
i would like to see him before i go
but i 'll meet him in the sky
you better watch out

when she dealt the cards i bet my heart
now i just found a game that i ca n't
and my heart is sinking like the setting sun setting
it 's time to say goodbye to yesterday and this

we 've been in and out of love and in
and now we 've played the final showdown scene
as the credits roll the sad song starts to play
and my heart is sinking like the setting sun setting

late in the evening about sundown
high on the hill and above the town
uncle pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
"you could hear it talk , you could hear it"
he played an old piece he called `` soldier 's
and the one called `` the boston boy ''
the greatest of all was `` jenny lynn ''

it 's not right to love you more than you
i ca n't run around with everyone to play with
so why must i be the one who 's always
this love affair is far from even and i believe
i wo n't love you any more than you love
it 's not right to love you more than you
you never send me flowers or ever buy me candy
you never bring me pretty things when you come to
and you forgot my birthday oh i wish you could
how i miss the little things that you do n't
you never say that i look nice or that you
you overlook the little things that you should see
these little things are big enough to hurt but too
but i do miss the little things that you do
now how can i miss flowers that never reached my
how can i taste candy that 's still at the
these little things mean a lot to me to you

yes i miss the little things that you do n't

theres a slow boat on my mind
everybody 's going like crazy
i 'm taking my own sweet time
i 'll drift down to big shark river
take a boat ride along the bay
just trying to find
a little peace of mind
down in the everglades
there ai n't gon na be no hurry
there ai n't gon na be no rush
just a lazy style like a crocodile
playin ' in the mangrove brush
i 'll float on down the river
let the speed boat speed away
i 'll drift around making gator sounds
down in the everglades
while the big crowd down the rivers
are gettin ' drunk on sea grape wine
i 'm gettin ' high watchin ' eagles fly
havin ' myself a time
wet my whistle every now and then
with a sip of cool gatorade
watch the sun go down
and let the world go 'round
down in the everglades
i 'll drift around
makin ' gator sounds

is he tall ? is he handsome ?
does he make enough and then some
does he miss you every minute that he 's gone
is he funny ? is he witty ?
does he tell you that you 're pretty
did he hang the moon ? did he do no
"is he mr. right , i wonder what he 's"
the one you 're waiting on
'cause there 's an empty seat beside you
and every guy here 's trying to buy you
"something to drink , but you just keep brushing them"
you 're watching whatever 's on cable
swirling your glass on the table
wondering how long is too long
is he working late ? is he worth the wait
the one you 're waiting on
how many glasses of cabernet
how many minutes slip away
how many times were you gon na check your phone
i 'm telling you if you were mine
you would n't be sitting here counting the time
you 'd never spend a single moment alone
i bet he do n't get how lucky he is
the one you 're waiting on
how many glasses of cabernet
how many boys can you turn away
how long 'til you turn off your phone

a woman needs someone to hold her
not someone to just lay her down .

"rely on , today and from now on ."
but you do n't know love from shinola .
you do n't know love from shinola .
"oh , but i gave you love and affection ,"
but you never gave one iota .
it was an early detection that you do n't know
you do n't know love from shinola .
you do n't know what true love 's about .
'cause you 'll find your world growin ' colder
when you 're alone and without .
"so go on , lover boy , have a big"
drink up on your bourbon and cola .
when you sober up you 'll be bleep out of
'cause you do n't know love from shinola .
i 'm in it for love but you 're just
'cause you do n't know love from shinola .
"you do n't know love , you do n't know"
"you do n't know love ,"
'cause you do n't know love from shinola .

i 'm talking way up loud
"i like pop , and rock , and rap ,"
and going out downtown when i 'm with her
like driving too fast down a 4-lane road
but damn sure nowhere close to the way that
"i love my country , i love my country"
"six strings and fiddles , whiskey from kentucky"
"we keep it funky , we like how it sounds"
"monday to sunday , yeah , i love my country"
"i 'm loud and proud , rolling into town"
"hanging out the window , like a blue tick hound"
"ai n't sorry , ai n't nothing to be sorry"
"i love my country , and i love my country"
up loud
"yeah , baby"
( woo-ooh-ooh )
i love my country up loud
"yeah , way up loud"
"that 's a country-ass lick right there , boy"
"for as long as i remember , when friday night"
the family would gather out at grandpa 's house .
with supper over and the dishes done
it was then the best time came
at an old upright piano that only grandma played .
"she played beautiful dreamer , my wild irish rose ;"
"she never played 'em perfect , but there was love"
"grandpa sat beside her , in harmony they sang ,"
at the old upright piano that only grandma played .
"grandpa was a stubborn man , they said it was"
"grandma called him ornery , but she said it with"
even he could not disguise the love he felt so
we all could see it in his eyes when she
"she played beautiful dreamer , my wild irish rose ;"
"she never played 'em perfect , but there was love"
"grandpa sat beside her , in harmony they sang ,"
at the old upright piano that only grandma played .
i was almost 17 when my grandma died ;
i stayed all night with grandpa ; the old man
"he sat at her piano , there was nothing we"
it was the first time in my life i ever
it was n't beautiful dreamer or my wild irish rose
it was a song he played from memory & he
i sat right there beside him until the morning came
what a friend we have in jesus was the only
"she played beautiful dreamer , my wild irish rose ;"
"she never played 'em perfect , but there was love"
"grandpa sat beside her , in harmony they sang ,"
at the old upright piano that only grandma played .
well i 've been lost in this town
even though i know my way around
did n't take me long until i found the devil
with just one word i knew his voice
is the one i heard in every choice i made
just trying to be a rebel
"in a small town , in a small town"
if you jumped off of our front porch
you 'd land right where the civil war was fought
and it 's never been forgotten
it 's twenty miles to the interstate
there 's a burger king and a motel 8
and the only thing between here and there is cotton
and jeffrey prays to jesus asking him please just help
"jenny gets high , she wastes her life , but"
"from a small town , from a small town"
"sometimes it was heaven , sometimes hell"
"kinda like church , kinda like jail"
there 's a water tower says 'welcome to nowhere '
as soon as i could i was long gone
my jeans were torn and my hair was long
now i ca n't believe i wan na go back
"to a small town , to a small town"
jeffrey prays to jesus asking him please just help us
"jenny gets high , she wastes her life , but"
but i knew i 'd come back some day
"to a small town , to a small town"
"oh to a small town , to a small town"
whooo-whooo ...
whooo-whooo ...
whooo-whooo ...
whooo-whooo ...
oh to a small town
i could tell that it was over
when her lips met mine
it was an emptiness in her voice
hesitation when she smiled
she did n't have to say a word
it was just so plain to see
she had found what she 'd been looking for
and i knew it was n't me
i saw goodbye in her eyes
i do n't think i can change it
there 's no way to disguise
we will never make it
sometimes i feel like a clown
who ca n't wash off his make-up
all she wanted it was gone
prince charming i was n't
but i would trade a thousand babylons
to be in her arms tomorrow
but like tide her love has come and gone
and it 's time for me to go
i saw goodbye in her eyes
i do n't think i can change it
there 's no way to disguise
we will never make it
now she sees right through me
should i hold on to what we 've got
is is just a waste of time
one thing that i know for sure
i saw goodbye in her eyes
i saw goodbye in her eyes
i know you got somebody new now
all my candles have burned out
he 's gon na love the way you shine
so did i
so do n't smile at me if it ai n't
with that goodbye in your eyes
i know that i ca n't change it
( know you see right through me )
there 's no way to disguise
we will never make it
i saw goodbye in your eyes
i know that i ca n't change it
"( now you see right through me , goodbye !"
should i hold on
we will never make it
"( now you see right through me , goodbye !"
should i hold on
is it just a waste of time
one thing that i know for sure
i saw goodbye in your eyes
i saw goodbye in your eyes
i know that it 's over
someones walking around up stairs i can hear him
and he just got up from sleeping in our bed
i will wake up and realize i was dreamin
even when i am strong awake i cant get it
cause i know someone is going to take my place
to the room where i walked out on you
please understand i couldnt stay

someone walking around up stairs and i cant get it
cause i know someone is going to take my place
to the room where i walked out on you
please understand i couldnt stay
i see a two story house with someone new warming
someones walking around upstairs and i cant get it out
"finally friday , kenny chesney"

yeah i have my addictions
and keep my share of secrets
and things you 'll never see
i get selfish and defensive
and pay too much attention
to my insecurities
oh i 'm just like everybody else
i try to love jesus and myself
i do n't know what you believe
or what you think of what you see
but this is a part of me
what i do and who i am
all my impurities
are right here on my sleeve
this is me
this is me
my heart break for the homeless
i worry about my parents
and all my bills are late
i 'm dealing with the changes
this complicated strangeness
of seeing life this way
i 'm just like everybody else
i try to love jesus and myself
i laugh at silly movies
tear up when i see babies
and i 'm stubborn as a stone
i criticize my body
i wonder if i 'm ready
to ever be alone
oh i 'm just like everybody else
i cry like everybody else

iâ€™d spent a lot more time out in the pouring
covering my head
and iâ€™d stood up to that bully when he pushed
but i was too afraid
and iâ€™d gone on and saw elvis that night he
mama said i could n't
and i 'd went skinny dipping with jenny carson that
but i did n't
"oh i , iâ€™d done a lot of things different"
i wish iâ€™d spent more time with my dad when
now i do n't have the chance
and i wish i 'd told my brother how much
but i just shook his hand
i wish iâ€™d gone to church on sunday morning when
but i was afraid of god
i wish i would of listened when they said boy
but i would n't
"oh i , iâ€™d done a lot of things different"
people say they would n't change a thing
even if they could
oh but i would

"i shoulda bought it , but i did n't"
she wanted to paint our bedroom yellow and trim it
"but i would n't let her , it would n't"
"she loved , to be held and kissed and touched"
"but i did n't do it , not nearly enough"
and if iâ€™d had known that dance was gon na
i 'd asked that band to play on and on

people say they would n't change a thing
even if they could

i went through the closet back in my old home
found a letterman 's jacket so i slipped it on
deep in the pocket still folded up tight
was the letter you wrote to tell me goodbye
the minute i saw it i just had to smile
it smelled like old leather as smooth as a child
i took a deep breath then put it away
there was no need to read it i knew just
"i know the words by heart , i know every"
from this ai n't easy to you 'll get along
"i know every comma , every question mark"
no i do n't have to look i know the

south of the border
down mexico way
that 's where i fell in love
when stars above came out to play
for it was fiesta
and we were so gay
south of the border
down mexico way
she was a picture
in old spanish lace
and for a tender while
i kissed the smile upon her face
for it was fiesta
and we were so gay
south of the border
down mexico way
south of the border
i rode back one day
there in a veil of white
by candlelight she knelt to pray
the mission bells told me
that i must n't stay
south of the border
down mexico way

i was a highwayman . along the coach roads i
with sword and pistol by my side
many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
the bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
but i am still alive .
i was a sailor . i was born upon the
and with the sea i did abide .
i sailed a schooner round the horn to mexico
i went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
and when the yards broke off they said that i
but i am living still .
i was a dam builder across the river deep and
where steel and water did collide
a place called boulder on the wild colorado
i slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
they buried me in that great tomb that knows no
but i am still around .. i 'll always be
around and around
and when i reach the other side
i 'll find a place to rest my spirit if
perhaps i may become a highwayman again
or i may simply be a single drop of rain
but i will remain
"and i 'll be back again , and again and"
they say love is blind
i know that still rings true
cause i could n't see it comin '
but when it landed i sure knew
well it knocked me to my knees
it hit me like a train
and i never will forget ole what 's her name
i got ta long term loss of shor term memory
and one thing in my life is for ever changed
i 'm sure i fell in love
with this angel from above
and i never will forget ole what 's her name
oh what 's her name ? ? ?
time just keeps on ticken
and i 've tried to move on
and though i keep on searchin '
i 'm pretty sure she 's gone
i know i 'll always miss her
and things will never be the same
and i never will forget ole what 's her name
i got ta long term loss of shor term memory
and one thing in my life is for ever changed
i 'm sure i fell in love
with this angel from above
and i never will forget ole what 's her name
oh what 's her name ?
she used to get her fix with just one little
? cause in her over the edge
"i keep her up , making love all night ,"
had the stuff to make her feel alright
but now she wo n't go near that ledge .
"she do n't get high anymore ,"
"i do n't make her fly like before ,"
her heart is out there soaring someone else
"i 'm not the song that she sings ,"
i ca n't give her those wings
"hard as i try , i 'm not the sky"
she do n't get high anymore .
i remember when she used to breathe me in
"back then , she could n't get enough ."
"we 'd lay looking out at the clouds ,"
i thought we never come down
she said my love was like some kind of drug
"but she do n't get high anymore ,"
"i do n't make her fly like before ,"
her heart is out there soaring someone else
"i 'm not the dream that she dreams ,"
i ca n't give her those wings .
"hard as i try , i 'm not the sky"
she do n't get high anymore .
"oh , i 'm not the song that she sings"
i ca n't give her those wings
"hard as i try , i 'm not the sky"
she do n't get high anymore
she do n't get high anymore
she do n't get high
anymore .
"she do n't get high , she do n't get"

you packed in the morning
i stared out the window
and i struggled for something to say
you left in the rain without closing the door
i did n't stand in your way
now i miss you more
than i missed you before
"and now where i 'll find comfort , god knows"
'cause you left me
just when i needed you most
"yes , you left me"
just when i needed you most
now most every morning
i stare out the window
i think about where you might be
i 've written you letters that i 'd like to
if you would just send one to me
'cause i need you more
than i needed before
"and now where i 'll find comfort , god knows"
'cause you left me
just when i needed you most
"yes , you left me"
just when i needed you most
you packed in the morning
i stared out the window
and i struggled for something to say
you left in the rain without closing the door
i did n't stand in your way
now i love you more
than i loved you before
"and now where i 'll find comfort , god knows"
'cause you left me
just when i needed you most
you left me
just when i needed you most
"oh , you left me"
just when i needed you most
i 'm not asking you to make a lot of
or to say that you 've been feeling like i
i may be sure just though but what i like
is would you like to go somewhere with me sometime
we could sit around and talked the way we did
when i met you you were with that friend of
things may not go just right just like they did
so would you like to go somewhere with me sometime
you 're with the same girl as the night i
did you tell her that i said i lose a
but since met you i just ca n't forget you
so it looks like this is where our friendship ends
we could sit around and talked the way we did
or do anything that we might have in mind
things may not go just right just like they did
so would you like to go somewhere with me sometime
[ guitar ]
you 're with the same girl ...
( just hang around my tears are overdue )
if you want to see somebody cry their heart out
for a love they lost and must live without
if you 're not afraid my misery might rub off
just hang around my tears are overdue
if you want to hear confessions from a broken man
who once held a world of love right in his
if you wan na see a heartbreak right in two
just hang around my tears are overdue
now there 's not a way that i can say
when a broken heart and guilty conscience starts to work
i hope you wo n't forget the sight you see
just remember love i had then threw away
if you 're not afraid my misery might rub off
just hang around my tears are overdue just hang around

yesterday i thought that i was low as i could
i had hit rock bottom ever since you up and
but this morning when i saw you with
"somebody else , well needless to say"
that 's when i started sinking even lower
and as far as where i am at today
there 's two feet of topsoil
"a little bit of bedrock , limestone in between"
a fossilized dinosaur
a little patch of crude oil
a thousand feet of granite underneath
then there 's me
i was kinda hopin ' i could dig my way
a couple dozen roses maybe get you back somehow
but the love in your eyes as you talked to
today was plain to see
"so i ai n't gon na get involved , but"
should you change your mind
well you know right where i 'll be
there 's two feet of topsoil
"a little bit of bedrock , limestone in between"
a fossilized dinosaur
a little patch of crude oil
a thousand feet of granite underneath
then there 's me
"well , there 's two feet of topsoil"
"a little bit of bedrock , limestone in between"
a fossilized dinosaur
a little patch of crude oil
a thousand feet of granite underneath
"yeah , there 's two feet of topsoil"

i love my daddy but it really do n't matter

and a gentle man is getting mighty hard to find
and you 're a tender man
and you 're man enough to show your love and
i really got the feeling that i 'll love you
i felt it from the moment we met you did
i love my daddy but it really do n't matter
i really got the feeling that i 'll love you

i spent last night in the arms
of a girl in louisiana
and though i 'm out on the highway
my thoughts are still with her
such a strange combination of a woman and a child
such a strange situation stoppin ' every hundred miles
callin ' baton rouge
a replay of last night 's events
roll through my mind
except a scene or two
erased by sweet red wine
and i see a truck stop sign ahead
so i change lanes
i need a cup of coffee
and a couple dollars change
callin ' baton rouge
operator wo n't you put me on through
i got ta ' send my love down to baton

"something 's missing , something 's wrong"
something 's not right where it belongs
why am i doubting what i thought i knew
what 's come over you
where 's the laughter where 's that touch
that made me feel you were in love
i pray it 's just a phase you 're going
what 's come over you
"i can roll with the tide , come in from"
"turn my back to the wind , stand my share"
but if you do n't love me there 's nothing
what 's come over you
all these memories of all those times
make it so hard to say goodbye
to all those dreams we shared that wo n't come
what 's come over you
"i can roll with the tide , come in from"
"turn my back to the wind , stand my share"
but if you do n't love me there 's nothing
where would you be
i wonder where your heart is
'cause it sure do n't feel like it 's here
sometimes i think you wish
that i would just disappear
have i got it all wrong
have you felt this way long
are you already gone
do you feel lonely
when you 're here by my side
does the sound of freedom
echo in your mind
do you wish you were by yourself
or that i was someone else
anyone else
where would you be
if you were n't here with me
where would you go
if you were single and free
who would you love
would it be me
where would you be
i do n't wan na hold you back
no i do n't wan na slow you down
i do n't wan na make you feel
like you are tied up and bound
'cause that 's not what love 's about
if there 's no chance we can work it out
tell me now
"oh , tell tell me now"
have i become the enemy
is it hard to be yourself
in my company
where would you be
where would you go
who would you love

i could n't begin to describe how it goes
but it makes me cry or laugh right out loud
it 's the song that i sing when there 's
this is the man that nobody sees
he wears my old clothes and he looks just like
just one of the boys who gets lost in the
he 's the man that i am when there 's
"it 's four in the morning , i 'm lying"
a tape of my failures playing inside my head
it 's heartaches and hard knocks and things i do
i listen and i wonder where will it go
this is a glimpse of a child that 's within
he 's so immature but he 's still my best
"if he could learn how to fly , he 'd"
he 's the kid that i am when there 's
this is a dance i do every day
i let my feet go and get carried away
i let my soul lead and follow the sound
it 's a dance that i do when there 's
"it 's still four in the morning , i 'm"
a tape of my failures playing inside my head
it 's heartaches and hard knocks and things i do
i listen and i wonder where will it go
this is the song that nobody knows
i still ca n't begin to describe how it goes
but it makes me cry or laugh right out loud
has it been ten years
since we said `` i do ''
i 've always heard marriage made one seem like two
but you 're looking better than you did back then
you still make this old heart give in
and if i had it to do all over
i 'd do it all over again
if tomorrow i found one more chance to begin
i 'd love you all over again
the preacher man said `` til death do us part
that seemed like forever to a young man 's heart
now the days seem much shorter
the longer we love
and the memories just keep adding up
if tomorrow i found one more chance to begin
i 'd love you all over again

with a shiner on my eye
fightin ' was against the rules and it did n't
when dad got home i told that story just like
then stood there on those tremblin ' knees
and waited for the worst
"he said , `` let me tell you a secret"
a secret that my daddy said was just between us
"he said , `` daddies do n't just love their"
"every now and then , it 's a love without"
"it 's a love without end , amen ''"
when i became a father in the spring of '81
there was no doubt that stubborn boy
was just like my father 's son
and when i thought my patience
had been tested to the end
i took my daddy 's secret and passed it on
"i said , `` let me tell you a secret"
a secret that my daddy said was just between us
"i said , `` daddies do n't just love their"
every now and then it 's a love without end
"it 's a love without end , amen ''"
last night i dreamed i died and stood outside those
when suddenly i realized there must be some mistake
if they know half the things i 've done
they 'll never let me in
then somewhere from the other side i heard those words
"they said , `` let me tell you a secret"
a secret that my daddy said was just between us
"you see , daddies do n't just love their children"
every now and then it 's a love without end
"it 's a love without end , amen ''"
i used to walk stooped
from the weight of my tears
but i just started laying my burdens down
i used to duck bullets from the rifle of fear
but i just started laying my burdens down
"oh , i 'm laying them down"
i just started laying my burdens down
"oh , i 'm laying them down"

i just started laying my burdens down
my soul took love on a hell of a ride

if i cross your mind please let me cross it
let me stop and reminisce with you for a while
and if i cross your mind please remember all the
think of me as happiness if i cross your mind
there must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind
and if there 's one of me love among them
please stop for just a little while and treat it
when you think of me love if i cross your
if you must hide my mem'ry when you 're with
then make mine very special when you 're by yourself
but only in a memory can one turn back the
to lovely tender moments that linger in my mind
there must be a million thoughts ...
think of only good things if i cross your mind

"`` twas battered and scared , and the auctioneer"
thought it scarcely worth his while
"to waste much time on the old violin ,"
but he held it up with a smile .
"`` what am i bidden , good folks , ''"
`` who 'll start bidding for me ?
"a dollar , a dollar - now who '' ll"
"two dollars , and who '' ll make it three"
"`` three dollars once , three dollars twice ,"
going for three '' . . but no !
from the room far back a gray-haired man
came forward and picked up the bow ;
"then wiping the dust from the old violin ,"
"and tightening up the strings ,"
"he played a melody , pure and sweet ,"
as sweet as an angel sings .
the music ceased and the auctioneer
"with a voice that was quiet and low ,"
said : `` what am i bidden for the old
and he held it up with the bow ;
`` a thousand dollars - and who 'll make it
two thousand - and who 'll make it three ?
"three thousand once , three thousand twice"
"and going - and gone , '' said he ."
"the people cheered , but some of them cried ,"
`` we do not quite understand -
what changed its worth ? '' the man replied :
`` the touch of the masters hand . ''
"and many a man with life out of tune ,"
"and battered and torn with sin ,"
is auctioned cheap to a thoughtless crowd .
much like the old violin .
"a `` mess of pottage , '' a glass of"
"a game and he travels on ,"
"he 's going once , and going twice -"
he 's going - and almost gone !
"but the master comes , and the foolish crowd ,"
"never can quite understand ,"
"the worth of a soul , and the change that"
by the touch of the master 's hand .

still trying to make a name .
knowing nothings gon na change what i am .

"oh , have you seen miss molly ?"
her cheeks are rosy red
now when miss molly 's smilin '
the sun is dim a spell
i 'll trade my horse
and saddle cow
drivin ' i 'll resign
now listen dear miss molly
i 've told you this before
her lips
are soft as satin
and they taste
like gingerbread
and when she laughs
her voice is like
a little silver bell
if only miss molly
will say that she 'll be mine
and even tho ' i told you so
i 'll tell you just once more
"oh , oh , oh , me , oh"
my miss molly
i 'm in love with you
"oh , me , oh , my miss molly"
wo n't you say you love me too
i 'd like to stay with you for a while
i could be happy here with you but i 'm
my strenght tells me my weakness shows you make me
of babies home security and jobs that last from nine
i could conjure up the constant state of happiness
but i know that i am just another man
and in knowing that i know that i 'll get
so i 'll do what i can
i have many steps to take reckless steps i can
a mountain waits for me to climb and i must
i could conjure up ...
but if you should not let me go and if
and for a while i 'll be a god instead
as i walk this land of broken dreams
i have visions of many things
but happiness is just an illusion
filled with sadness and confusion
what becomes of a brokenhearted
who had love that 's now departed
i know i 've got to find
"some kind of piece of mine , baby"
the roots of love grow all around
but for me they come tumble all down
"every day , heartaches grow a little stronger ( just"
i ca n't stand this pain much longer
"i walk in shadows , searching for a life"
"cold and alone , no comfort inside"
hoping and praying for someone who cares
always moving and going nowhere
what becomes of a brokenhearted
who had love that 's now departed
i know i 've got to find
"some kind of piece of mine , help me"
i 'm searching though i do n't succeed
"for someone 's love , there 's a growing leaf"
oh is lost there 's no place for beginning
all that 's left is that unhappy ending
what becomes of a brokenhearted
who had love that 's now departed
i know i 've got to find
some kind of piece of mine
i 'll be searching everywhere
just to find someone to care
i 'll be looking every day
i know i 'm gon na find a way
nothing 's gon na stop me now
i will find a way somehow
( what becomes of a broken hearted )
honey put down that flyswatter
and pour me some ice water
and would you bring me my hammer
and could you find me some nails
for soon i 'll be going
to work for this living
and with you here to guide me
then i can not fail
the morning it stumbles
right in through the window
and this getting up early
gets old anyway
and if you listen close dear
the crying that you hear
is the nighttime lamenting
the start of the day
and it 's hotter than concrete
in july in houston
and it 'll get worse here
before it turns nice
but old tink 's in the backyard
and i swear that boy 's so smart
he 's got everything ready
so we 'll be all right
so honey put down that flyswatter
and pour me some ice water
and though i 'll soon be going
well i have n't gone yet
so come stand here beside me
and hold my hand gently
and tell me do you remember
the first time we met
roll me up and smoke me when i die
"and if anyone do n't like it , just look"
"i did n't come here , and i ai n't"
so do n't sit around and cry
just roll me up and smoke me when i die
"now , you wo n't see no sad and teary"
when i get my wings and it 's my time
call my friends and tell 'em
"there 's a party , come on by"

so you 'll sing and tell more jokes and dance
"just keep the music playin ' ,"

"and if anyone do n't like it , just look"
"i did n't come here , and i ai n't"
so do n't sit around and cry

"hey , take me out and build a roaring fire"
roll me in the flames for about an hour
then take me out and twist me up
and point me towards the sky
and roll me up and smoke me when i die

"and if anyone do n't like it , just look"
"i did n't come here , and i ai n't"

just roll me up and smoke me when i die
i think i go and see someone
and talk about what i´ve become
it 's beginnig to get the best of me ...
i never was a drinking man
but now i finally understand
how something can bring you to your knees
i 'm addicted to two blue eyes
intoxicated by you every night
i can feel you running through my blood
i 'm under the influence of love
it´s got a hold of me and it won´t let
it 's on the verge of being out of control
it´s got me climbing the walls and walking floor ...
i can´t seem to get enough of you
it´s all i ever wan na do
and i keep craving you more and more
i 'm addicted to two blue eyes
intoxicated by you every night
i can feel you running through my blood
i 'm under the influence of love
baby what am i supposed to do ?
i´ve become dependent on you ...
i 'm addicted to two blue eyes
intoxicated by you every night
i can feel you running through my blood
i 'm under the influence of love
i 'm under the influence of love
i 'm under the influence of love
sometimes i smile when you stayied home for a while
what did you expect me to do
i always cry each time you told a lie
what did you expect me to do
chours :
"each time i forgave you , you were bolder"
and each time you hurt me my heart grew colder
"sure , i love you but i found someone new"
what did you expect me to do
chours :
"each time i forgave you , you were bolder"
eachyou hurt me my hear grew colder
"sure , i love you but i found someone new"
let 's begin with the day i met her
how fast this good old boy 's world got better
"sky got bluer , the grass got greener"
just the first few seconds after i first seen her
like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
my best old jeans and my broke in sneakers
a home run pitch floating right down the middle
the sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
she 's
right on the money
she goes directly to my heart
and when it comes to loving me
"she 's everything , i mean bulls eye perfect"
she 's right on the money
she 's no red lights when i 've overslept
she 's a three point jump shot that 's nothing
"a hand full of aces , the dealer 's done"
"i 'm forever on a roll , that 's how"
she 's
right on the money
she goes direct to my heart
"and when it comes to loving me , she 's"
she 's
right on the money
she 's the best cook that 's ever melted cheese
"i ai n't much around the house , but i"
there 's absolutely no reason to doubt her
when she says i would n't last ten minutes without
she 's
right on the money
she goes directly to my heart
and when it comes to loving me
"she 's everything , i mean bulls eye perfect"
she 's
right on the money
i 've had enough
of words and games
i do n't think i know you
i ca n't forget your name
your eyes are clear
the way is strange
the light 's in the hallway
if you forget your way
you were here to be only
what you wanted anyway
you were sad to be sorry
you were sorry everyday
you were here to be loved
but love 's trickled away
from your eyes
i tell myself
i 'm least of all to blame
for these words of my choosing
for my rules that make the game
but my eyes are clear
i can see the way is strange
through the dark of the hallway
that echoes back your name
i was here to be only
what i wanted anyway
i was sad to be sorry
i was sorry everyday
i was here to be loved
but love 's trickled away
from my eyes
you kindle the fire of love inside me each time
i 'm not strong when we 're alone your kisses
you must know how i feel but do you feel
every time you kiss me you add fuel to the
my eyes light up when i see you i burn
each time you 're near you say you care but
please do n't ask me to love you if you
cause every time you touch me you add fuel to
this fire of love you started inside of me has
you 're adding fuel to a flame that 's already
when you give me your name i 'll give you
yes everytime you kiss me you add fuel to the
"early this morning , he knocked on my door"
early this morning he knocked on my door
"i said `` hello , satan , i believe it"
me and the devil are walkin ' side by side
me and the devil are walkin ' side by side
"well , i 'm goin ' to beat my man"
he says i do n't do him right
that i dog him around
"well , babe , you know you ai n't treating"
he says i do n't do him right
that i dog him around
"well , it must be this old evil spirit"
so deep down within the ground
you may bury my body down by the highway side
"... oh , babe i do n't care what you"
you may bury my body down by the highway side
so my old evil spirit can catch a greyhound bus
"early this morning , he knocked on my door"
now me and the devil are walking side by side
side by side

that your baby boy will one day walk on water

will soon deliver you

love that runs away from me
dreams that just wo n't let me be
blues that keep on botherin ' me
chains that just wo n't set me free
too far away from you and all your charms
just out of reach of my two open arms
each night in dreams i see your face
memories time can not erase
then i awake and find you gone
i 'm so blue and all alone
so far away from lips so sweet and warm
just out of reach of my two empty arms
that lonesome feelin ' all the time
knowing you can not be mine
dreams that hurt me in my sleep
vows that we could never keep
too far away from lips so sweet and warm

when our friends are fast asleep
you say you 'd like to take a stroll with
"though we are wed to others , and it may"

when i fall in love it will be forever
or i 'll never fall in love
in a restless world like this is
love is ended before it 's begun
and too many moonlight kisses
seem to cool in the warmth of the sun .
when i give my heart it will be completely
or i 'll never give my heart
and the moment i can feel that you feel that
is when i fall in love with you .
when i give my heart it will be completely
or i 'll never i 'll never give my heart

your cheatin ' heart will make you weep you 'll
but sleep wo n't come the whole night through your
when tears come down like falling rain you 'll toss
and you 'll walk the floor the way i do
your cheatin ' heart will pine someday and you 'll
the time will come when you 'll be blue your
when tears come down ...
this is the gospel according to me
a tale of whiskey turned to wine
ai n't no moving of a mountainai n't no parting

my miracle is five foot five
no doubt in my mind

i was n't always spiritual
oh but one thing 's for sure
how could i not have faith in the god that
my mama used to pray some day i 'd see
never thought it 'd be in someone 's eyes
in a crowded restaurant on a friday night
"i heard angels sing , my whole life changed"
and i realized
my miracle was standing right there
looking so beautiful with blue jeans and long brown hair
i was n't always spiritual
oh but one thing 's for sure
how could i not have faith in the god that
to see me now
it 's crazy how
my life changed
but here i stand
a better man
and you can blame
my miracle
i was n't always spiritual
oh but one thing 's for sure
how could i not have faith in the god that

sometimes she just wants to dance and move on
she taps her feet and sheds a tear
plays air guitar and raises a beer .

but through it all when there was doubt i ate
i faced it all and i stood tall and did
i 've lived i 've laughed and cried i 've

skinny legs
like i always wanted
if i needed you
would you come to me
would you come to me
and ease my pain
if you needed me
i would come to you
i 'd swim the seas
for to ease your pain
in the night forlorn
"ah , the morning 's born"
and the morning shines
with the lights of love
you will miss sunrise
if you close your eyes
that would break
my heart in two
lady 's with me now
since i showed her how
to lay her lilly hand in mine
loop and lil agree
she 's a sight to see
and a treasure for
the poor to find
"i could hold out my arms , say `` i"
i could tell you how long i will long for
how much and how far would i go to prove
the depth and the breadth of my love for you
from here to the moon and back
who else in this world will love you like that
"love everlasting , i promise you that"
from here to the moon and back
from here to the moon and back
i want you to know you can always depend
on promises made and love without end
no need to wonder how faithful i 'll be
now and on into eternity
from here to the moon and back
who else in this world will love you like that
"forever and always , i 'll be where you 're"
from here to the moon and back
from here to the moon and back
i would blow you a kiss from the star where
i would call out your name to echo through the
"thank heaven for you and to god , tip my"
from here to the moon and back
and i 'll spend forever just proving that fact
from here to the moon and back
lord i fell for her smile
and she loved me for a while
then she said good-bye got ta go
left me standing on the side of the road
now she 's gone and i 'm a memory in
and the long and short of it some things never
"oh because summers come , summers go"
i 'll keep walking down this road
it 's alright and it 's okay
i 'll live to love another day
i 'll live to love another day
lord i 'm out here again
with my back to the wind
the warm sun that 's sinking low
is gon na leave me out in the cold
but the long and short of it some things never
and if that goes for the good
it must go for the bad
if i fall down
i 'm not ashamed
i always get back up again
but i 'll be fine 'till the right one comes
lord i fell for her smile
and she loved me for a while
and someday she 's gon na wish
she had n't left me here like this
i 'll live to love another day
i 'll live to love another day
i 'll live to love another day
"bows and flows of angel hair , and ice cream"
"feathered canyons everywhere , i 've looked at clouds that"
"now they only block the sun , they rain and"
"so many things i could have done , but clouds"
i 've looked at clouds from both sides now from
"it 's cloud 's illusion i recall , i really"
moons and junes and farris wheels . the dizzy dancing
when every fairytale comes real . i 've looked at
now that 's just another show you leave them laughing
if you care do n't let them know do n't
i 've looked at love from both sides now from
it 's love 's illusion i recall i really do
tears and fears and feeling proud to say i love
dreams and schemes and circus crowds i look at life
now old friends are acting strange . they shake their
but something 's lost and something 's gained in living
i 've looked at life from both sides now from
it 's life 's illusion i recall . i really
like a long lonely stream i keep running for the
like a branch on a tree i keep reaching to
there 's a place in the sun where there 's
where my poor restless heart 's got ta run
there 's a place in the sun and before my
like a dusty old road i get weary from the
like this tired troubled earth i 've been running since
there 's a place in the sun ...
"that lipstick on your collar , well , it ai"
and i can tell by the smell of that perfume
and there 's a little wine stain on the pocket
"well , you drink beer and whiskey , boy ,"
found it over in the corner
wadded up on the bedroom floor

"you shoulda burned it , you shoulda lost it"
"now i'ma have to hang you out to dry ,"

i was sittin ' on my doorstep
i hung up the phone
and it fell out of my hand
but i knew i had to do it
and he would n't understand ...
so hard to see myself without him
i felt a piece of my heart break
but when you 're standing at a crossroad
and there 's a choice you got ta make ...
i guess it 's gon na have to hurt
i guess i 'm gon na have to cry
and let go of some things i 've loved to
i guess it 's gon na break me down
like falling when you try to fly
sad but sometimes movin ' on with the rest of
starts with goodbye
i know that there 's a blue horizion
somewhere up ahead just waiting for me
but getting there means leaving things behind
sometimes life 's so bittersweet
time heals
the wounds that you feel
somehow

you did n't know i was n't free when you
and with all your young heart you learned to care
it brought you shame and disgrace the world has tumbled
cause they call our love a back street affair
they say you wrecked my home
i 'm a husband that 's gone wrong
they do n't know the sorrow that we 've had
for the one that i 'm tied to was the
yes they call our love a back street affair
we have each other now that 's all that matters
oh the judgement of gossip 's never fair
we 'll just be brave and strong then someday they
let them call our love a back street affair
we 'll be free for love someday when all the
and the happiness we 've hoped for then we 'll
i 'll climb a mountain high and then the world
that our love is not a back street affair

to turn away is easy to follow only fools
and the way back in is hard it 's a
i ca n't show you any more lies
i only hope that you realize
there 's darkness on the playground and nothing left to

i 'm only a dreamer of romance
my love dreams can never come true
i 'll just pretend that i 'm happy
and smile thru these tears dear at you
i dreamed of a cabin of love dear
where all of our dreams would come true
but another has taken my cabin
and left me so lonely and blue
nestled around my cabin
that means all the world to me
our love sweet heart will always linger
for you are a part dear of me
where is the love we once cherished
why did n't our love dreams come true
all i can do now is dream dear
of a cabin sweetheart dear and you
nickels and dimes
memories and wines
she 's on his mind once again
the same old stool
the same old fool
played by the rules but did n't win
there 's an old love in his heart that he
he tried forgettin ' but he knows that it 's
he 's got a fool hearted memory
but it wo n't let him see
that she walked out the door
he 's got a fool hearted memory
he sits patiently
here every night so it can fool him more
she was his girl
his only whirl
that string of pearls that slipped away
a thousand dimes
a thousand times
he does n't mind what they say
he fills the jukebox
and plays the same old song
he fills his glass
and then he turns her memory on
but it 's a fool hearted memory
it wo n't let him see
that she walked out the door
he 's got a fool hearted memory
he sits patiently
here every night so it can fool him more
tonight my heart is sad and weary
wonderin ' if i 'm wrong or right
i dream about you though you 've left me
i wonder where you are tonight
the rain is cold and slowly fallin '
upon my window pane tonight
and though you 're love was even colder
i wonder where you are tonight
"it 's spring , the birds are gaily singing"
the trees are blossoming so sweet
no other love was quite so happy
no other love was so complete
then came the dawn the day you left me
i tried to smile with all my might
but you could see the pain within me
it still lingers in my heart tonight
"oh , the rain is cold and slowly fallin '"
upon my window pane tonight
and though you 're love is even colder
i wonder where you are tonight
"i turn the tv off , to turn it on"
staring at the blades of the fan as it spins
"counting every crack , the clock is wide awake"
"talking to myself , anything to make a sound"
"i told you i would n't call , i told"
but baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
i do n't think that i can take this bed
"come over , come over , come over , come"
you can say we 're done the way you always
it 's easier to lie to me than to yourself
"forget about your friends , you know they 're gon"
"we 're bad for each other , but we ai"

on one hand i count the reasons i could stay
"and hold you close to me , all night long"
so many lover 's games i could play with you
and on that hand i see no reason why it
"but on the other hand , there 's a golden"
to remind of someone who would not understand
on one hand i could stay and be your loving
but the reason i must go is on the other
"in your arms i feel the passion , i thought"
when i looked into your eyes i found myself
when i first kissed your lips i felt so alive
"i 've got to hand it to you girl ,"
"somewhere tonight , there 's somebody cryin '"
and feelin ' completely alone
"somewhere tonight , there 's somebody tryin '"
to find a way back home

that some of us never find

people sit around and they talk and talk
how their dreams all ended too soon

we got up before sunup to get the work done
we 'd work in the fields till the sun had
we 've stood and we 've cried as we helplessly
a hailstorm a beatin ' our crops to the ground
and i 've gone to bed hungry many nights as
in the good old days when times were bad
i 've seen daddy 's hands break open and bleed
and i 've seen him work till he 's stiff
i 've seen mama lay and suffer in sickness
in need of a doctor we could n't afford
anything at all was more than we had
in the good old days when times were bad
no ammount of money could buy from me
the mem'ries that i have of them
no ammount of money could pay me
to go back and live through it again

i hoped i 'd get you off my mind
it 's been a long time but i find
that i still think of you as much as always
"as much as always , as much as always"
just as much as always
as much as always just as much as always
"i still miss you , still think of you"
"just as much as always , as much as always"
just as much as always
"i still want you , still need you"
just as much as always
i hoped that i 'd find someone else
but there 's too much of you still left
"and i still love you , just as much as"
i hoped that i 'd forget your touch
but i still want it just as much
and i still need it just as much as always
"as much as always , as much as always"

everybody says you let me down i should be ashamed
makes no difference what you used to do darling i
maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find
in my heart i know that you 'll come true
( darling i could never be ashamed of you )
all the happiness i 've ever known came the day
and it matters not what we go through darling i
maybe you were cheated in the past and perhaps old
but in my heart i know that you 'll come
what to do and where to start ?
things are falling all apart
trying hard to move ahead
but keep losing ground instead
still i have to take a chance
putting fear and doubt aside
had no warning in advance
nothing left to do but try
and i just might make it work
i just might make it after all
i just might rise above the hurt
thought i 've suffered quite a fall
but i have to get a grip
and hold on to it like a vice
have to face the falling chips
"i just might make it , i just might"
"oh , i might have been a fool"
but its true that love is blind
and you have broken every rule
you 've taken all that yours and mine
and how does one go on with life ?
when your shattered so inside
pieces of a love gone wrong
"well , ya pick'em up and you move along"
but i just might make it work
i just might make it after all
i just might rise above the hurt
thought i 've suffered quite a fall
i just might live to see the day
"i can say `` hey i 'm alright , i"
i better go on either way
"rise above it , i just might be stronger then"
"well , i might even be surprised"
i 've got to get on with my life
i just might make it
i just might
nothin left to do but try
i might make it
i just might
the first time i looked in your eyes i knew
that i would do anything for you
the first time you touched my face i felt
like i 've never felt with anyone else
i wan na give back what you 've givin '
and i wan na witness all of your dreams
now that you 've shown me who i really am
i wan na be more than just your man
i wan na be the wind that fills your sails
and be the hand that lifts your veil
and be the moon that moves your tide
the sun coming up in your eyes
be the wheels that never rust
and be the spark that lights you up
all that you 've been dreaming of and more
"so much more , i wan na be your everything"
"when you wake up , i 'll be the first"
and when it gets dark you can reach out for
i 'll cherish your words and i 'll finish your
"and i 'll be your compass baby , when you"
i wan na be the wind that fills your sails
and be the hand that lifts your veil
and be the moon that moves your tide
the sun coming up in your eyes
be the wheels that never rust
and be the spark that lights you up
all that you 've been dreaming of and more
"so much more , i wan na be your everything"
be the wheels that never rust
and be the spark that lights you up
all that you 've been dreaming of and more
"so much more , i wan na be your everything"
"livin on the road my friend , is gon na"
now you wear your skin like iron
your breath as hard as kerosene
"you were n't your momma 's only boy , but"
she began to cry when you said goodbye
and sank into your dreams
"pancho was a bandit boy , his horse was fast"
he wore his gun outside his pants
for all the honest world to feel
pancho met his match you know on the deserts down
"nobody heard his dyin words , ah but that 's"
"all the federales say , they could 've had him"
"they only let him slip away , out of kindness"
lefty he ca n't sing the blues all night long
the dust that pancho bit down south ended up in
"the day they laid poor pancho low , lefty split"
"where he got the bread to go , there ai"
"all the federales say , they could 've had him"
they only let him slip away out of kindness i
"the boys tell how old pancho fell , and lefty"
"the desert 's quiet , cleveland 's cold"
and so the story ends we 're told
"pancho needs your prayers it 's true , but save"
"he only did what he had to do , and"
"all the federales say , they could 've had him"
they only let him slip away out of kindness i
"a few gray federales say , they could 've had"
they only let him slip away out of kindness i
"listen poor sinner , you 're driftin ' away"
from the dear saviour who 's pleading to day
what will you do when the saviour ai n't nigh
when the pale horse and his rider goes by ?
the time now ai n't long when the saviour will
then you 'll be judged by the deeds you have
on that judgment day you 'll weep and you 'll
when the pale horse and his rider goes by
when that trumpet sounds on the sinners below
not even the angels in heaven will know
then 's when you 'll wish you had jesus nigh
when the pale horse and his rider goes by
wo n't you redeem your poor wicked soul
you ca n't pay your way with silver and gold
if you 're not saved you 'll be lost in
when the pale horse and his rider goes by
if i had one call to make
i would dial yesterday
and warn myself
tell my lips the words to say
and not let you just walk away
with someone else
with someone else
next time i wo n't suffer this kind of pain
all my mistakes i just pass off for the blame
if you were here
we could figure this out
then i would n't be bitter
i 'd just be better now
to be the strong and silent one
a lot of good that has done
yes you agree
no more trying to understand
or fix these things because you can
guess it 's up to me
yeah it 's up to me
next time i wo n't suffer this kind of pain
all my mistakes i just pass off for the blame
if you were here
we could figure this out
then i would n't be bitter
i 'd just be better now
i 'd be much better off
much better off maybe
if i could just let it go
with no regrets left
next time i wo n't suffer this kind of pain
all my mistakes i just pass off for the blame
you 'd still be here
and we 'd figure this out
then i would n't be bitter
then i would n't be bitter
i 'd just be better now .

never thought we 'd fade
like the stamp on the back of her hand
we were her on my shoulders
lighter in the air

we were a top down at johnson 's field
when she whispered that she wants me

of sweet in the bitter

did they mean nothing to you
and where are the feelings i thought that we shared
or have you forgotten them too
did you think i could just put your memory behind

i drank a lot back then for one concern
success for me lay just around the corner
i thought my social friend would help me make the
but now i 'm paying for the days of wine
a victim of the drunken life i chose
now all my social friends look down their noses
for i kept the wine and threw away the rose
i stood by and watched the bottle take control of
the turn i made was not the one i planned
and i watched my social standings slip away from me
as i slowly watched the bottle take command
and now i 'm paying for the days of wine
a victim of the drunken life i chose
now all my social friends look down their noses
ai n't no chains strong enough to hold me
ai n't no breeze big enough to slow me

ai n't no jail tried enough to lock me
ai n't no man big enough to stop me
i 'll be there if you ever want me by
"so love me , if your ever going to love"
i never have seen a river that too wide
i 'll be there ready and a waiting
there wo n't be any hesitating
i 'll be there if you ever want me by
ai n't no road kind enough to bind me
look for me honey and you 'll find me

long sunday drives out
in the country
i 'm your cup of tea
"girl , you 're gon na love me"
come and rest your head against my chest
'cause i 'm the one for you
you do n't have to look no more
your search is through

of fresh wild flowers
a back rub on a bad day
talkin ' for hours
i 'm good company
girl you 're gon na love me
come and rest your head against my chest
'cause i 'm the one for you
you do n't have to look no more
your search is through
so girl if you like a big heart
that 's in this for the long haul
till we 're rockin ' on the front porch
and they 're callin ' me papaw
till the last breath you breathe
girl you 're gon na love me
just try it and see
girl you 're gon na love me

everybody says itâ€™s going to a little time
might as well get used to her running through my
her memory brought me to my knees
when will i be back up walking
only time will tell but it ainâ€™t talking
lot of sleepless nights iâ€™m sure are lying up ahead
wondering when the night will come when i lay down
and her memory finally decides to stop calling
"only time will tell , but it ainâ€™t talking"
only time will tell when i will finally be free
but so far it hasnâ€™t spoken a single word to
wonder when the pain will end
and all the tears will stop falling
"only time will tell , but it ainâ€™t talking"
only time will tell when i will finally be free
but so far it hasnâ€™t spoken a single word to
wonder when the pain will end
and all the tears will stop falling

they call me a playboy
as i 'm making my rounds
chasing the bright light
of each night spot in town
"though i never show it ,"
my heart 's breaking in two
they may call me a playboy
but i 'm just lonesome for you
i once had a real love
that was when i had you
now i 'll never feel love
with somebody new
this false front i 'm wearing
is just to cover my blues

"jesus , sweet jesus if you 're listening"
can you pass me to your pa .
i 'm having a hard time understanding
why he 's so cruel and demanding
with his love .
"darling , sweet darling keep whispering"
i 'll find you through this din .
"sitting and watching ,"
two flames busy dancing
to our love .
"grab on to this moment , inhale it"
and hold it inside .
"savour its sweetness ,"
yearn for the slide .

can you pass me to your pa .
i 'm having a hard time understanding

got an easy place to be
"in my arms , yeah in my arms"

my shoulder still burns
where you touched me last night
you hugged me and walked out the door
we 've been pretending
that we 're only friends
but tonight we can feel something more .
( both )
just being around you
is making me warm
one touch and i know that i 'll
melt in your arms
there 's no way to stop
this burning desire
'cause there 's nothing as hot as a
slow burning fire .
( tammy )
you look in my eyes
just a little too long
before i can look away
but lately i 've caught you
staring at me
with a new kind of look on your face .
( both )
just being around you
is making me warm
one touch and i know that i 'll
melt in your arms
there 's no way to stop
this burning desire
'cause there 's nothing as hot as a
slow burning fire .

i like kickin ' back on the sofa
flippin ' through the channels just to see what 's
i enjoy eatin ' eggs over easy
soppin ' up with a biscuit 'til the yellow 's
ai n't nothin ' like watchin ' a bunch of
run screamin ' through the sprinkler in their little bare
and ai n't nothin ' like finding twenty dollars
in the pocket of the britches that you wore last
i get into getting out on my mower
in the early mornin ' hours 'fore the sun gets
and i like goin ' down to the kroger
when the carnival comes to the parkin ' lot
ai n't nothin ' like throwing a hula popper
draggin ' it across a spot a big 'un oughta
and ai n't nothin ' like having him for supper
with some good hush puppies and some sweet iced tea
this old world is full of simple pleasures
they 're all good but some are better
ai n't nothin ' like finding that woman
that you know you 're gon na love for the
and ai n't nothin ' like knowing the lord 's
back one day to make you want to do it
"you are my sunshine , my only sunshine"
you make me happy when skies are gray
"you 'll never know dear , how much i love"
please do n't take my sunshine away
i 'll always love you and make you happy
if you will only say the same
but if you leave me for another
you 'll regret it all some day
"you are my sunshine , my only sunshine"
you make me happy when skies are gray
"you 'll never know dear , how much i love"
so please do n't take my sunshine away
"the other night dear , as i lay sleeping"
i dreamed i held you in my arms
"but when i awoke , dear , i was mistaken"
so i hung my head and i cried
"you are my sunshine , my only sunshine"
you make me happy when skies are gray
"you 'll never know dear , how much i love"
please do n't take my sunshine away
"you are my sunshine , my only sunshine"
you make me happy when skies are gray
"you 'll never know dear , how much i love"
please do n't take my sunshine away
please do n't take my sunshine away
i 'd like to hold my head up and be
but they wo n't let my secret go untold .
"i paid the debt i owed them , but they"
now i 'm a branded man out in the cold
"when they let me out of prison , i held"
determined i would rise above the shame .
"but no matter where i travel , the black mark"
i 'm branded with a number on my name .
i 'd like to hold my head up and be
but they wo n't let my secret go untold .
"i paid the debt i owed them , but they"
now i 'm a branded man out in the cold
"if i live to be a hundred , guess i"
'cause everybody knows i 've been in jail .
"no matter where i 'm living ,"
i 've got to tell them where i 've been
or they 'll send me back to prison if i
i 'd like to hold my head up and be
but they wo n't let my secret go untold .
"i paid the debt i owed them , but they"
now i 'm a branded man out in the cold
now i 'm a branded man out in the cold
lately nothing i do
ever seems to please you
and maybe turning my back
would be that much easier
cause hurtful words are all that we exchange
but i ca n't watch you walk away
cause i forget about the way it feels to touch
and all about the good times that we 've been
could i wake up without you everyday
and would i let you walk away ?
"no , i ca n't i learn to live without"
and i ca n't give up on us now
i know i could say we 're through ?
and tell myself i 'm over you
but even if i made a vow
a promise not to miss you now
and try to hide the truth inside
i fail cause i ...
i just ca n't live a lie
could i forget the look that tells me what you
and all the reasons that make lovin ' you so
the kiss that always makes it hard to breathe
that way you know just what i mean
no i ca n't learn to live without
so do n't you give up on us now
and i do n't wan na try
oooooh ...

i feel the fingerprints
that you left on my heart
you played a game of love
and then you said we had to part
you left me all alone
and as the teardrops start
i feel the fingerprints
of sorrow on my heart
i know you did n't mean to be unkind
and hurt me so
and you 've made up your mind
but i just thought you ought to know
that when the day is thru
i think of only you
i sit alone and dream
and think of things we did n't do
now i am all alone
and as the teardrops start
i feel the fingerprints
that you left on my heart
and when the day is thru
i think of only you
i sit alone and dream
and think of things we did n't do
now i am all alone
and as the teardrops start
i feel the fingerprints
that you left on my heart
"blue me , blue me"
blue is the color
that fits best on me
i 'm blue
just as blue as can be
"blue me , blue me"
i cry
and i die
i lie awake at night
and i question why
must it be
i can never be free
"blue me , blue me"
my heart is heavy
but it 's empty inside
no one to love me
or to lay down beside
i 'm blue
the queen of sorrow
wears royal blue
my luck ai n't changin '
is it ever goin ' to
"i 'm blue , oh i 'm blue"
why must i wear this robe of blue misery
"blue me , blue me"
ooh
this sad old feeling
is breakin ' me down
no satisfaction with these blues hangin ' 'round
"lord , i 'm blue"
"oh , i 'm so blue"
why ca n't i shake it tell me where will
when will i get out of this blue rut i
"oh , i 'm blue"
looks like the blues just took a liking to me
"blue me , blue me"
"blue me , blue me"
blue is the color that fits best on me
"ooooh , i 'm blue"
i 'm just as blue as can be
"blue me ,"
blue me
across a crowded room
i ca n't keep my eyes off you
you take my breath away
looking at me now
i know what you are thinking about
you are thinking about the way
you woke me up this morning and made sweet love
oh baby
i love the way you touch me
you know my body so well
you do much more to love me
til i 'm overwhelmed
wrapped up inside of you is where i want to
because no body knows
no body knows
no body knows the secrets that we keep
once we get inside these four walls
all the hesitation falls
we ca n't wait no more
as you help me get undressed you do n't have
baby you know what i want
i want to love you til the sun comes up
til i am sure you are satisfied
oh baby
i love the way you touch me
you know my body so well
you do much more to love me

i once was lost in sin but jesus took me
and then a little light from heaven filled my soul
it bathed my heart in love and wrote my name
and just a little talk with jesus made me whole
now let us have a little talk with jesus
let us tell him all about our troubles
he will hear our famished cry
he will answer by and by
now when you feel a little prayer turning
and you know the little talk with jesus makes it
sometimes my path seems dreary without a ray of cheer
and then the cloud about me hides the light of
the mists in me rise and hide the stormy skies
but just a little talk with jesus clears the way
i may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled
but jesus is a friend who watches day and and
i go to him in prayer he knows my every
and just a little talk with jesus makes it right
you will find a little talk with jesus makes it
makes everything right
"well , santa looked a lot like daddy"
or daddy looked a lot like him
it 's not the way i had him pictured
santa was much too thin
he did n't come down the chimney
so mama must have let him in
santa looked a lot like daddy
or daddy looked a lot like him
"well , they thought i was fast a sleepin '"
they thought that i was tucked in bed
they never thought i 'd come a peepin '
or that i 'd hear what was said
santa put his arm around mama
and mama put her arm around him
so if santa claus ai n't daddy
then i 'm a gon na tell on him
i never saw dancer or prancer
i never heard the sleigh bells ring
i never saw the red nosed reindeer
like they show on the tv screen
but he sure brought a lot presents
so santa claus he must have been
"well , he sure looked a lot like daddy"
or daddy looked a lot like him .

there 's a little mountain church in my thoughts of
where friends and family gathered for the lord
where an ol ' fashioned preacher taught the straight and
for what few coins the congregation could afford
"dressed in all our sunday best , we sat on"
and i remember how our voices filled the air
how mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano
and `` when the roll is called up yonder i
looking back now that little mountain church house
has become my lifes cornerstone
it was there in that little mountain church house
i first heard the words i based my life upon
"at the all day sunday singing , with dinner on"
many were the souls that were revived
while the brothers and the sisters who 've gone on
slept in peace in the maple grove nearby
somewhere out there on the prairie alone my guardian angel
is there at rest somewhere in the west that pioneer
i 'd give all i own today if someone would
to that hallowed spot where she 's sleeping that pioneer
there is nothing left of her busy life but the
a couple of rugs on the kitchen floor and an
her garden has a deserted look and the weeds show
and the things she fought run wild and you stop
but if you had known as well as i knew
and the neighborly warm big heart of hers i think
that not all the people that we call great are
and perhaps the finest thing in life is a homely
so the little life with the homely tasks has worked
what if the weeds grow rank again and what if
ah the little woman of small account with the cheerful
for the tide of years will produce her like to
i 'd give all i own today if someone would
to that hallowed spot where she 's sleeping that pioneer
we gather tonight for a celebration
under the flag of a no-shoes nation
"speakin ' our gospel , seekin ' our truth"
brothers in arms and sisters and cowboys

we drank all the wine
and we burned all the candles to the ground
we danced to every dance they played 'til silence seemed
and i could 've sworn not long ago
the sun was only startin ' to go down
but when did all the stars
fade just like the moon ?
and how 'd it get so late so soon ?
twilight was just leavin '
when the first kiss of the evening got us high
and time stood at a standstill when the whole world
"and that last kiss you gave me , baby ,"
when did that early bird
start singin ' his first tune ?
how 'd it get so late so soon ?
"oh , i could 've sworn not long ago"
the sun was only startin ' to go down
but when did all the stars
fade just like the moon ?

for whistlers and jugglers .... and singers of songs
now she was a child ... back when i first
and the woman inside her ... was just bein '
and i knew she 'd come with me ... cause

and the whistler will whistle her ... a song she
and jugglers will cheer her ... when she starts to
the singer will sing her ..... a bed of red
where she might let you .... lie by her side
she 'll laugh in the face ... of the wealthy
and you 'll never lose her .. to the handsome
but all of your life son ... watch over your
for whistlers and jusgglers ... and singers of songas ..
"glory to his name , oh , holy , holy"
there 's a city where the streets are paved in
a land where the milk and the honey flow
and a mansion which for me
'cause my bible tells the story
i just hope my feet are clean enough
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
green meadows where the little children play
"no sorrow there , just one long happy day"

silver sandals .
in silver sandals she goes walkin ' up those golden
and though we miss her so we know she 's
she walks with us in memory we see her all
in silver sandals walkin ' through our minds .
so many times we let our thoughts turn back to
to a little girl that could only watch the children
she walks with us in memories we see her all
in silver sandals walkin ' through our minds
the grave in which she sleeps is cold but our
and we cry as we both long to hold her
each night in dreams we see her running to us
with silver sandals on her feet
in silver sandals she goes walkin ' ...
she had asked for sandals from the time that she
and it would break our hearts when she 'd asked
she 'd say when i go to heaven can i
for a pair of silver sandals at the rainbow 's
in silver sandals she goes walkin ' ...
in silver sandals she goes walkin ' through our minds

i had a hundred dollar ring in my hand
so weak and tired i could barely stand
from bein up all night praying she 'd say yes
so with a hopeful heart i hit one knee
with a tear in her eye she looked at me
"it was the moment of truth , i was scared"
my life hung on what that tear meant
"then she smiled at me , and i lost it"
"no one can make me cry , make me laugh"
"make me smile or drive me mad , like she"
it 's like a curse that is the cure
"better or worse , one thing 's for sure"
it 's real love
and i do n't know what i 'd do if
well the honeymoon ended and life began
"jobs and bills , losing touch with friends"
and that apartment got smaller everyday
then one night the walls finally closed in
"i came home late , she said where have you"
you used to call and tell me you 're on
she said if this is how its gon na be
"she walked out the door , i lost it ..."
i picked myself up off the floor
she walked back through the door
we made love like it was the first time
oh if i lost it ( if i lost it
well you walked into my heart like it was some
i should have known better i had seen your kind
you rolled in like a tumble weed the texas wind
and i feel another heartache coming on
theres no doubt about it darlin you 're the hurtin
like all those other memories branded on my mind
i fell right into this one you were coming on
and i feel another heartache comin on
well its a shame you couldnt keep those promises you
tellin me you would never do me wrong
another lesson i will learn
you 're just another heartache comin on
well i guess i 'll learn the hard way darlin
theres no sense in crying it will only make it
so we 'll go on our seperate ways and i
until i feel another heartache comin on
until another heartache comes along
i 've never been the kind that you 'd call
always stumbling ' around in circles
but i must have stumbled into something
look at me
am i really alone with you
i wake up feeling like my life 's worth living
ca n't recall when i last felt that way
guess it must be all this love you 're giving
never knew never knew it could be like this
but i guess
some hearts
they just get all the right breaks
some hearts have the stars on their side
"some hearts ,"
they just have it so easy
some hearts just get lucky sometimes
"some hearts just get lucky , lucky sometimes"
now who 'd have thought someone like you could love
you 're the last thing my heart expected
who 'd have thought i 'd ever find somebody
someone who someone who makes me feel like this
well i guess
some hearts
they just get all the right breaks
some hearts have the stars on their side
"some hearts ,"
they just have it so easy
some hearts just get lucky sometimes
some hearts just get lucky sometimes
even hearts like mine
"get lucky , lucky sometimes"
some hearts
they just get all the right breaks
"some hearts have the stars on their side , yes"
"some hearts ,"
they just have it so easy
some hearts just get lucky sometimes
"some hearts just get lucky ,"

eyes that said more than your words ever did and

do i still love you the answer is yes if
two loving arms that i felt welcome in arms that
how do you erase sweet mem'ries you miss if i
sad circumstances that stood between us would n't let us

do n't know just how long but i 've
been trapped in here quite a while
"wonder if i 'll make it out , ah-ah ,"
"i miss my friends , i miss the sky"
feel like i just live to die
"but that ca n't be what life 's about ,"
i think they just lock me up to taunt me
"i wo n't ever let nobody own me , own"
i do n't let these thoughts of freedom haunt me
what you gon ' do when they learn the truth
every time i
feel like i just ca n't take it no more
i get angry
that 's when i start runnin '
in my mind 's eye
lies the key that 'll open the door
you ca n't break me
there 's a new day comin '
that 's what happens when you let a bunch of
think our biggest problem is
it all gets so monotonous
"holding us all hostages , ah-ah , ah-ah"
weighin ' down on top of us
draining all our confidence
"but i wo n't stay anonymous , ah-ah , ah-ah"
i think they just lock me up to taunt me
"i wo n't ever let nobody own me , own"
i do n't let these thoughts of freedom haunt me
what you gon ' do when they learn the truth
every time i
feel like i just ca n't take it no more
i get angry
that 's when i start runnin '
in my mind 's eye
lies the key that 'll open the door
you ca n't break me
there 's a new day comin '
that 's what happens when you let a bunch of
"let me out this cage , i 've been here"
"planning my escape , i see the break of dawn"
what you gon ' do when they learn the truth
every time i
feel like i just ca n't take it no more
i get angry
that 's when i start runnin '
in my mind 's eye
lies the key that 'll open the door
you ca n't break me ( you ca n't break
there 's a new day comin '
every time i ( oh woah )
feel like i just ca n't take it no more
i get angry ( i get angry )

in my mind 's eye ( in my mind 's
lies the key that 'll open the door
you ca n't break me ( you ca n't break
there 's a new day comin '
that 's what happens when you let a bunch of
a corner dive down on the square
where the windows hang with a neon flare
regulars shoot horse and pool
while the barmaid wishes the place half full
she works the jar with a discount flirt
with a faded houston oilers shirt
while an old crow sings down on the stage
thumbing the chords on a crinkled page
he plays his zevon tune
beneath the gulf moon
take a walk down along the wall
you 'll go right on past the carnival
hand in hand with the keeper kind
the kind that ties to the ties that bind
they do n't care for the carnie man
or the fortune teller that reads your hand
they just beeline for a bungalow
where the curtains flutter
and candles glow in the heart of june
beneath the gulf moon
here i 'm on a midnight porch
looking up at a butane torch
that hangs behind a black expanse
where the stars flicker and planets dance
it is probably time i pack it in
with a glass half-full of jameson
well i was born to croon
i might as well
beneath the gulf moon
down by the jetty near the balinese pier
the curmudgeons drink the yellow belly beer
and they bitch about the price of gas
and the fish that they ca n't seem to catch
they blame it on the islands way down south
from the bayou marsh and the delta mouth
where the choppers are rollin and tankers come
in the midnight daze for the oil drum
they ca n't leave too soon
beneath the gulf moon
everybody 's talkin ' bout me
i do n't hear a word they 're sayin '
only the echoes in my mind
everybody stops to starin '
i do n't even see their faces
only the shadows of their eyes
i 'm goin ' where the sun keeps shinin '
going where the weather suits my clothes
bankin ' off the northeast wind and sailin ' on
skippin ' over the ocean like a stone
everybody 's talkin ' bout me
i do n't hear a word they 're sayin '
only the echoes of my mind
everybody stops to starin '
i do n't even see their faces only the shadows
i wo n't let you leave my love behind
i wo n't let you leave my love behind
i wo n't let you leave my love behind
the fisherman
are pitching pennies
in the sand
beside the sea
the sunrise hits
their oilskin boots
and their painted boats
and me
they seem
to know the ocean
like a man
knows a woman
she makes him
wait around
for half the morning
for the tide to turn
"pull on the ropes ,"
seine haul fisherman
never catches more
than he knows
he can sell in a day
"pull on the ropes ,"
seine haul fisherman
day 's for work
night 's the time
to go dancing
they 're drinking beer
and laughing
and squinting at the sun
waiting for the gulls
to tell them
when the fish will come
their faces brown
and weathered
from all the nets
they 've run
they 've learned to wait
they always know
that the tide will turn
"pull on the ropes ,"
seine haul fisherman
never catches more
than he knows
he can sell in a day ;
"pull on the ropes ,"
seine haul fisherman
day 's for work .
night 's the time
to go dancing
way out on the ocean
the big ships
hunt for whales
the japanese
have caught so many
that now
they hunt for snails
my fisherman 's not greedy
he seems content to live
with the sun and the sand
and a net full of fish
when the tide turns
pull on the ropes
seine haul fisherman
never catches
more than he knows
he can sell in a day
pull on the ropes
seine haul fisherman
day 's for work
night 's the time
to go dancing
pull on the ropes
seine haul fisherman
never catches
more than he knows
he can sell in a day
pull on the ropes

day 's for work
night 's the time
to go dancing
i do n't ever think about tomorrow
whether or why is all on another day
and i think it 's been said by somebody up
the older guys tell me what it 's all about
the older guys really got it all worked out
since we got the older guys to show us how
i do n't see why we ca n't stop right
it 's so cold staying living down on the ocean
dead on the beach is where i want to rent
and i think it 's been said by somebody up
the older guys get the ladies with their style
the older guys squeeze 'em till it makes them smile
what 's the sense of looking like a cop on
what 's the sense of looking like a girl on
i see you 're doing well
"well , i 'm not"
got someone new in your life
"well , i do n't"
i 've been busy wantin ' you back
and you 've been busy movin ' on way too
guess my heart 's takin ' the long way out
it do n't even know what to do
and seein ' you with him tonight
i guess i do n't break like you
"i do n't drink like you do , i ca"
"'cause i 'm still drinkin ' 'bout us , so"
wish i could laugh and dance on a saturday night
"like you do , like goodbye ai n't even crossin"
maybe you 're just good at gettin ' gone
or i 'm just really bad at movin ' on
"i 'm still in love , girl , it 's"

i 've been thinking it over wondering what to do
up to now i 've been leaving it up to
but you 'll always be the way you 've always
i ai n't got the time to go through that
i 've been wasting time and i 'm to blame
living with things i could n't change
and the one conclusion i 've come to
i 've been wasting time and a lot of good
i 've made up my mind to make my move
it 's just a waste of time to wait on
i 'm set to leave and you 're set in
you ca n't change and if you ca n't i
i 've been wasting time that i ca n't spare
wastin ' love when you do n't care
and the one conclusion i 've come to
i 've been wasting time and a lot of good
i 've been wasting time and i 'm to blame
well you can have her i do n't want her
she only wanted someone to play with but all i
when you 're stuck with the wrong woman there ai
you just dig a hole and crawl right in it
well you can have her ...
the girl i love she upped and left me she
comes home at night for just for an hour when
well life without love is mighty empty but confession is
i 'd rather have love for just an hour than
well you can have her ...
now you can have her ...
hallelujah ( i 'm ready ) i 'm ready (
i can hear the voices singing soft and low
hallelujah ( i 'm ready ) i 'm ready (
hallelujah i 'm ready to go
in the darkness of night not a star was in
on a highway that leads down below
but jesus came in and saved this soul from sin
hallelujah i 'm ready to go
sinners do n't wait before it 's too late
he 's a wonderful savior you know
well i fell on my knees and he answered my
hallelujah i 'm ready to go
in the morning you go gunning for the man who
and you fire till he is done in but they
and the mourners are all singing as they drag you
but the hangman is n't hanging so they put you
you go back jack do it again wheels turning round
you go back jack do it again
when you know she 's no high climber then you
in a room with your two timer but you 're
then you love a little wild one and she brings
all the time you know she 's smiling you 'll
you go back jack do it again ...
[ guitar ]
now you swear and kick and beg us that you
then you find you 're back in vegas with a
your black cards can bring you money so you hide
in the land of milk and honey you must put
you go back jack do it again ...

a tall drink of water in a cotton dress
"that preacherâ€™s daughter , she sure is blessed"
as sunlight passes through the fabric so soft
you can imagine what goes through my thoughts
she says there 'll be time for all of that
when my dress is white and your suit is black
there 's so many fish in the sea
and i know itâ€™s a great big world
but i couldnâ€™t help but fall in love so hard
for my dry county girl
"for my dry county girl , yeah"
itâ€™s widely known that i have my flaws
while sheâ€™s the joan of arkansas
her lips wonâ€™t touch the demon wine
but her eyes are full of pure moonshine
and i get drunk just holding her hand
i get high thinking i could be her man
for my dry county girl
"lord , i fell so hard"
for my dry county girl
"for my dry county girl , yeah"
"yeah , talking about my"

that last long day he said goodbye
"oh , lord , i thought i would die"

what a beautiful dream
i hate to think it all over
i lost my heart it seems

and i 'm nobody 's sugar-baby now
'cause i 'm lonesome
i got the lovesick blues
"now i 'm in love , i 'm in love"
that 's what 's the matter with me
"well , i 'm in love , i 'm in"
but he do n't care about me
"well , i tried and i tried to keep him"
but he just would n't stay
"but now that he is leavin ' , this is"
"i got a feelin ' cause i 'm blue ,"

i like to drink my beer
spend time with the boys
"after work , to down a few"
is something i enjoy
"and sometimes i stay out too late ,"
yes i know it 's true
but i love only you .
and i like to take life easy
work out in the yard
sleep late on the weekends
after an all-night game of cards
and drivin ' my old chevy
on a sunday afternoon
but i love only you
i like my old guitar
and i 'd like to be a star and shine
i 'd like to write a song
the whole world could sing along about
i love only you
i like my old memories
the girls i used to know
some of them still have a place
my mind likes to go
of all the ones i 've cared for
lord knows that 's been a few
but i love only you
"ah , honey , i love only you ."
away in a manger
no crib for a bed
the little lord jesus
lay down his sweet head
the stars in the sky
look down where lay
the little lord jesus
asleep in the hay
the cattle are lowing
the poor baby wakes
but little lord jesus
no crying he makes
i love thee lord jesus
look down from the sky
and stay by my cradle
till morning is nigh
choir sings : away in a manger
no crib for a bed
the little lord jesus
lay down his sweet head
the stars in the heavens
look down where he lay
the little lord jesus
asleep on the hay
martina sings : away in a manger
no crib for a bed
the little lord jesus
lay down his sweet head
i love thee lord jesus
look down from the sky
and stay by my cradle
till morning is nigh

sitting alone in an old rockin ' chair
i saw an old mother with silvery hair
she seemed so neglected by those who should care
rocking alone in an old rockin ' chair
her hands were caloused and wrinckled and old
a life full of hard work was the story they
and i 've thought of angels as i saw her
rocking alone in an old rockin ' chair
bless her old heart do you think she 'd complain
though life has been bitter she 'd live it again
and carry that cross that is more than her share
rocking alone in an old rockin ' chair
[ piano ]
( it would n't take much just to gladden her
just some small re-embrace on somebody 's heart )
a letter would brighten her empty life there
rocking alone in an old rockin ' chair
i know some youngsters in an orphan 's home
would think they owned heaven if she were their own
they 'd never be willing till let her sit there
rocking alone in an old rockin ' chair
i look at her and i think what a shame
the ones who forgot her she loves just the same
and i think of angels as i see her there
rocking alone in an old rockin ' chair
rocking alone in an old rockin ' chair
there a roadhouse just outside of town on a two-lane
where all the folks come to hear country music play
"and every year the city 's gettin ' closer ,"
and old hank the bartender gave us the bad news
this land was our land but lord now it 's
"and we 're still here , but not for long"
so let 's raise a cold one and play all
'til we 've sung the last country song
there 's 300 acres of cotton corn and a little
all bought up by a builder from downtown
tomorrow when the earth starts a-shakin and the walls start
a big bulldozer 's gon na take hank 's roadhouse
will we play \ '' swingin'\ '' or \ ''
it 's really sad to see it end this way
'til we 've sung the last country song
oh we 've sung the last country song
oh we 've sung the last country song
now you 're lookin ' at a man that 's
i 've had a lots of luck but it 's
no matter how i struggle and strive i 'll never
my fishin ' pole is broke the creek is full
my woman ran away with another man
no matter how i struggle abd strive i 'll never
a distant uncle passed away and left me quite a
and i was livin ' high until that fatal day
a lawyer proved i was n't born i was only
everythin 's again ' me and it 's got me
if i jumped in the river i would probly drown
no matter how i struggle and strive i 'll never

"take me , take me to your darkest room"
close every window and bolt every door
and the very moment i heard your voice
"i 'd be in darkness , darkness no more ."
oh take me ( take me ) to your most
a thousand miles from the nearest sea
the very moment i saw your smile
it would be like heaven to me .
there 's not any mountain to rugged to climb
no desert to barren to cross
some where if you could just show me a sign
i could bare any lose .
so take me ( take me ) to siberia
in the coldest weather in the wintertime
and it would be just like spring in california

"`` dolly , what 's your secret ?"
"with all you do , your attitude"
just seems to be so good
how do you keep it ? ''
"well i 'm not the dalai lama , but i"

"you better get to livin ' , givin '"
do n't forget to throw in a little forgivin '
and lovin ' on the way
"you better get to knowin ' , showin '"
a little bit more concerned about where you 're goin
just a word unto the wise
you better get to livin '
a girlfriend came to my house
started cryin ' on my shoulder sunday evening
she was spinnin ' such a sad tale
i could not believe the yarn that she was weavin
so negative the words she had to say
i said if i had a violin i 'd play
"i said you 'd better get to livin ' ,"
be willing and forgivin '
cause all healing has to start with you
"you better stop whining , pining"
get your dreams in line
"and then just shine , design , refine"
until they come true
and you better get to livin '
"your life 's a wreck , your house is mess"
and your wardrobe way outdated
all your plans just keep on falling through
"overweight and under paid , under appreciated"
"i 'm no guru , but i 'll tell you"
this i know is true
"you better get to livin ' , givin '"
a little more thought about bein '
a little more willin ' to make a better way
do n't sweat the small stuff
keep your chin up
just hang tough
and if it gets too rough
fall on your knees and pray
and do that everyday
then you 'll get to livin '
the day we 're born we start to die
do n't waste one minute of this life
get to livin '
share your dreams and share your laughter
make some points for the great hereafter
better start carin '
better start sharin '
better start tryin '
better start smiling
and you better get to livin '
that little girl knows a lot about cheating
caught him red handed too many times
she knows about lying and leaving
never had someone who really walked the line
i 'm gon na change that
that girl wo n't be lonely long
i 'm gon na change that
she 's gon na know where she belongs
right now she thinks her heart 's just made for
but i 'm gon na change that
she knows a litte too much about teardrops
cried her a mile wide river of them
all that bad luck 's got her thinking she 's
"always long gone , over before it even begins"
i 'm gon na change that
that girl wo n't be lonely long
i 'm gon na change that
she 's gon na know where she belongs

that it 's right here with me
by my side
forget about those tears you cried
honey i 'm gon na change that
oh i 'm gon na change that
blame it all on my roots
i showed up in boots
and ruined your black tie affair
the last one to know
the last one to show
i was the last one
you thought you 'd see there
and i saw the surprise
and the fear in his eyes
when i took his glass of champagne
and i toasted you
"said , honey , we may be through"
but you 'll never hear me complain
'cause i 've got friends in low places
where the whiskey drowns
and the beer chases my blues away
and i 'll be okay
i 'm not big on social graces
think i 'll slip on down to the oasis
"oh , i 've got friends in low places ."
"well , i guess i was wrong"
i just do n't belong
"but then , i 've been there before"
everything 's all right
i 'll just say goodnight
and i 'll show myself to the door
"hey , i did n't mean"
to cause a big scene
just give me an hour and then
"well , i 'll be as high"
as that ivory tower
that you 're livin ' in
i guess i was wrong
i just do n't belong
"but then , i 've been there before"
and everything is alright
i 'll just say goodnight
and i 'll show myself to the door
i did n't mean to cause a big scene
just wait 'til i finish this glass
then sweet little lady
i 'll head back to the bar
and you can kiss my ass

nobody saw him running from sixteenth avenue .
they never found the fingerprint or the weapon that was
"but someone killed country music , cut out its heart"
they got away with murder down on music row .
the almighty dollar and the lust for worldwide fame
slowly killed tradition and for that someone should hang

"they all say not guilty , but the evidence will"
that murder was committed down on music row .

with drums and rock 'n roll guitars mixed right up

indestructable memories are passing in review
impossible though things may get improbable i will forget
indelible memories of sweet loveable you

those arms are not real but somehow i feel
if i 'd just close my eyes then maybe it
invisible tears in my eyess ...

the clouds had left an early snow
a peaceful sound was calling low
`` it 's time to go ''
then god reached out his tender hand
and gently pulled her home with him
and brushed away the sorrow from her soul within
and i could hear the roses sing
a bluebird softly claps its wings
the sun seemed brighter than it 's ever been
and now she 's dancing in the wind
with her true love again
where her heart has always been
where her heart has always been

it was a cold and dark december night
but a star still lit the sky
away in a manger you heard a baby cry
it was the cry of the son of god
a little baby boy
born in that manger to bring the world joy
so hush up little baby
you know not what you 'll do
you 'll bring the world peace and love
and teach them while you do
you have nothing to fear because you know
god is with you all the way
that little important baby
born on christmas day
many people soon gathered round that tiny run down barn
they knew not of what they saw
"then came three all dressed in fancy robes , silks"
this was the first indication of the importance of his

you 'll bring the world peace and love
and teach them while you do

god will lead the way
that little important baby
born on christmas day
we expected a soldier to save us from our plight
"all dressed in shiny armor , ready for a fight"
but instead he sent a little baby boy
all filled with love happiness
to bring the world joy
so hush up little baby
you know not what you 'll do
you 'll bring the world peace and love
and teach them while you do
you have nothing to fear because you know
god will lead the way

i was sittin ' beside the road in blackjack county
not knowing that the sheriff paid a bounty
for men like me who did n't have a penny
so he locked my leg to thirty-five pounds
of blackjack county chain
all we had to eat was bread and water
each day we had to build that road a mile
black sneak whip would cut our backs
when some poor fool complained
but we could n't fight back wearin ' 35 pounds
of blackjack county chain
and then one night while the sheriff was a sleepin
we all gathered round him slowly creepin '
and heaven help me to forget that night in the
when we beat him death with thirty-five pounds
of blackjack county chain
now the whip marks have all healed and i am
that there 's nothing but a scar round my ankle
most of all i 'm glad no man will be
to a black sneak whip and thirty-five pounds
of blackjack county chain

"in spite of all the hard times , i 'd"

but when you cross that ol ' red river hoss
"cause ' once you 're down in texas , bob"
well if you ai n't never been there then i
that you just ca n't live in texas unless you
"it 's the home of willie nelson , the home"

the drinks they 're cold and the ladies are hot
and i know this is the place for me
so get away to where the boat leaves from
it takes away all of your big problems
you got worries you can drop them in the blue
but you got ta get away to where the boat
see the problem is that you 're down there
and there 's a perfectly good island somewhere
where a ride that floats and do n't grab your
you wo n't need them where we are going

out on a boat that is huge

down on the sand where its cool
put me down
when i fall off my stool
put me down
i 'll just sleep there til morning comes around
with sunshine and ladies and pina colodas
and bob marley songs that are playing
there 's a sound in my ear that i want
soft tropical lips that are saying
get away to where the boat leaves from
it takes away all of your big problems
you got worries you can drop them in the blue
but you got ta get away to where the boat
come on along and we 'll go down to a

no matter where i may wander no matter where i
there 's a place way down yonder i 'm goin
come on along and we 'll go down ...
you 'll just love this place called cowtown
he got here red and wrinkled scared and cryin '
then she took him up and held him to her
and he sure was glad to get what mama offered
then he went to sleep and put his fears to
it did n't seem to matter what he needed
he could always count on mama to supply
and regardless of the sleep she might be losin '
he always found a twinkle in her eye
there ought to be a hall of fame for mamas
creation 's most unique and precious pearls
and heaven help us always to remember
that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
she taught him all the attributes of greatness
that she knew he could n't learn away from home
and by the time she wore the cover off her
her hair was gray and her little man was gone
there ought to be a hall of fame for mamas
creation 's most unique and precious pearls
and heaven help us always to remember
that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
"yes , the hand that rocks the cradle rules the"
although the years have changed now
and we go by different names
i remember the sound
of our roof in the rain
and my mind goes back in time
to a place so far gone
where the love we left behind us was still new
we were listening to a record
on the end of your bed
not giving thought to where it was all going
and i wished right then and there so badly
i could read your mind
just so i could know the things that you were
"i believe , yes i do"
the hardest part is always
leaving love behind
"i believe , yes i do"
that everything we lose
will be a gift in time
but the hardest part is leaving love behind
when it was time to say goodbye
those words came down like stones
i admit for so long after
it was hard to feel at home
we 'd hear the highway song
shifting down in the night
i was grateful that the echoes broke the quiet
"i believe , yes i do"
the hardest part is always
leaving love behind
"i believe , yes i do"
that everything we lose
will be a gift in time
but the hardest part is leaving love behind
the sun fades is on me now
and i miss you like words ca n't know
and i missed my shot at dying young a long
it 's just a lesson learned in love
"it 's not angry , it 's not sad"
sometimes you got ta lose something
to know what you have
"i believe ( i believe ) , yes i do"
the hardest part is always
leaving love behind
"i believe ( i believe ) , yes i do"
"oh , that everything we lose"
will be a gift in time
"i believe ( i believe ) , yes i do"
the hardest part is leaving love behind

frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
with a corn cop pipe and a button nose
and two eyes made out of coal
frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
he was made out of snow
but the children know how he came to life one
there must of been some magic in
that ol ' silk cap they found
for when they placed it on his head
he began to dance around
frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
and the children say he could laugh and play
just the same as you and me
frosty the snowman knew the snow was hot that day
so he said lets run and have some fun before
down to the village with a broom stick in his
runnin ' here and there all around the square
sayin ' catch me if you can
he led them down the streets of town
right to the traffic cop
and he only paused a moment when he heard him
frosty the snowman
had to hurry on his way
but he waved goodbye sayin ' please do n't cry
i 'll be back again some day

get away and get out on my own

needs a man loving me
and i find me a perfect catch
then i see my friends
having wild weekends
then i do n't wan na get quite so attached
just as soon as i get what i want
i get unsatisfied
good is good but could be better
"i keep looking , i keep looking for"
i keep looking for something more
i always wonder what 's on the other side
of the number two door
i keep looking
looking for something more
"well , the straight haired girls"
they all want curls
and the brunettes wan na be blonde

so unlike the other times
it 's so pure it 's almost sacred
simply put it feels divine
i just love you pure and simple
pure and simple and sublime
do n't it seem we spend a lifetime
looking for that perfect love ?
like a dream we finally we found it
pure and simple
"well , good for us"

simply put it feels divine
i just love you pure and simple

i just love you pure and simple
ca n't believe you 're really mine
yesterday i use to hide the feeling deep inside
never let nobody look
but for you my life 's an open book
tonight my heart is questioning
as the moment comes
something very special here
butterflies have already begun .
could it be love i found tonight
"never believe it , that it might yes it might"
"i ca n't remember ever , having it feel so"
could it be love i found tonight ?
you filled my life with tenderness
encouragement as well
you helped bring out the best in me
you slowly helped me crawl out of my shell
you are so beautiful
have given me today something really wonderful
something that may never go away .
could it be love i found tonight
"never believe it , that it might yes it might"
"i ca n't remember ever , having it feel so"
could it be love i found tonight ?
"can i be alone with you , passions from today"
no words can quite explain this glorious pain .
could it be love i found tonight
"never believe it , that it might yes it might"
"i ca n't remember ever , having it feel so"
could it be love i found tonight ?

i heard you told him that you 'd love him
now that 's the same thing that you told me
gee ai n't it funny how time slips away
i got ta go now i guess i 'll see
do n't know when though never know when i 'll
but remember what i tell you in time you 're
and it 's surprising how time slips away
all day long i worry all night i 'm blue
i feel so awfully lonesome i do n't know what
and so i ask you doctor to see if you
something in your sachet to pacify my mind
oh doctor doctor write me a prescription for the blues
latly tell you doctor why i 'm in misery
once i had a lover he went away from me
i went to see the ejection and the voodoo doctors
they shook their heads and told there was nothing they
oh doctor doctor why not write me a prescription for
just like a little baby all night night i cry
now doctor if you ca n't cure me why i
so give me something poison doctor wo n't you please
and then i 'll sign a peper sayin ' i
oh doctor doctor write me a prescription for the blues
"i was blue , just as blue as i could"
ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
then good luck came a-knocking at my door
skies were gray but they 're not gray anymore
blue skies
smiling at me
nothing but blue skies
do i see
bluebirds
singing a song
nothing but bluebirds
all day long
never saw the sun shining so bright
never saw things going so right
noticing the days hurrying by
"when you 're in love , my how they fly"
blue days
all of them gone
nothing but blue skies
from now on
i should care if the wind blows east or west
i should fret if the worst looks like the best
i should mind if they say it ca n't be
"i should smile , that 's exactly what i do"
i watched him take your heart and walk away
and leave you wondering what mistake you made
and i 'd never try to take his place
i guess there 's really nothin ' i can say
but i can be that whiskey in your bottle
i can be that smile that takes away your tears
i can be the place you just want to run
i can be that somethin ' to get you through
love can build you up and shut you down
fill your heart with joy or make it drown
i do n't know if i can help you see
it makes you blind sometimes to what you need
but i can be that whiskey in your bottle
i can be that smile that takes away your tears
i can be that place you just want to run
i can be that somethin ' to get you through
"yeah , i can be that whiskey in your bottle"
i can be that smile that takes away your tears
i can be that place you just want to run
i can be that somethin ' to get you through
i wan na be that somethin ' to get you

"well , it seems you thought it over"
and you feel i 'm not the one
and you think you might do better on your own
you say lover 's vows only hold you down
"so i guess i 'm moving on ,"
but what 'll you think about me when i 'm
what will you think about me when i 'm gone
when old memories fall like footsteps .
will you think it 's me coming home ?
"well , i thought your eyes could see compromise ,"
but that 's one thing you 've never done .
what 'll you think about me when i 'm gone
will some other 's kiss taste sweeter
or will my pictures haunt your room ?
will it make your nights pass easier
or will you think you were a fool
when my pillow 's bare and you 're lying there
will a heartache linger on ?
what 'll you think about me when i 'm gone
what 'll you think about me when i 'm gone

mama used to tell me tales
'bout a part of town
where people cry the blues
most everyday
she said do n't go down there boy .
"you know , love will cut you down"
"and you ai n't yet a man , hear what"
"she said listen to me , son , it 's"
"let me tell ya , i 've been down there"
and i know
that on love street they 've got signs
that say watch for falling victims
dreams get run down in the night
lord and yours might be the next one
down where lies 'll cut you deep
and goodbyes are loaded guns
you can take one through the heart
another casualty of love
but still i had to find out
just how a love would feel
i got tangled in the arms
of one gone bad
now i sit and wait and wonder
as i cry myself to sleep
why i could n't heed what my mama said
new her every word rings clear and true
now i 've come to realize what love can do
and why love street still got signs ....
"good mornin ' , mornin ' glory"
"good mornin ' , what 's your story"
"good mornin ' , where 'd you spend the night"
where did your night dreams take you
sorry but i had to wake you
"oh , i just had to make you"
shed your precious mornin ' light on me
"oh , good mornin ' sleepy baby"
"you know , i 'm thinking maybe"
i love you even more today
every time you go to sleep
i 'm jealous of the dreams
that keep you away from me
"good mornin ' , mornin ' glory"
i 'll have to thank the sandman
for he 's let you wake up in my arms
"doo doo da , doo doo doo , doo"
"oh , come on darling time to get up"
i have your breakfast table set up
it 's such a lovely morning to see
and i have my mornin ' glory with me
there ai n't enough of me to go around
got all kinds of reasons
to be all over town
spread venom broken down
everybody wants a piece
oh darlin i 'm afraid
you 've been last but not least
everyone i love the most
has to take what 's left of me
i put it all together
but i left out one big piece
i put you last
but you 're not least
nothing ever takes the place of you
sometimes things that may not matter
jump in front of things that do
and your fine to stand in line
while history repeats
but oh darlin not this time
last but not least
everyone i love the most
they deserve the best from me
i put it all together
when i found that missing piece
you were the last
but you 're not least
i go left when i should go right
i chase the dark when i see light
i trip and fall down every time i try
to walk that line
the sun comes up i look for rain
i search for joy and i find the pain
i swear i will never get again
last but not least
last but not least
everyone i love the most
is gon na see the best of me
i put it all together
when i found the missing piece
you were the last
you were the last
but you 're not least

walk the llama llama
take in the panorama
walk the llama llama - llama llama
do n't have to be a drama
walk the llama llama - llama llama
no one could be calmer
walk the llama llama

fluff up your fur

cool in the summer
warm in the cold
a perfect fashion statement
for the young and the old
a cloak for the priest
a hat for the farmer
you could be looking at the emperor 's pajamas
that 's way the llama walks so proud
that 's way the llama holds his head up in
all of us applaud his generosity
he 's more than just a passing curiosity
he covers up our pride
and all those things we have to hide
in any civilized society
tonight there 'll be candlelight and roses
in this little country chapel that 's almost falling down
there 'll be tears in this old farmer 's eyes
when i give my one possession to that city boy
his hair is a little longer than we 're use
"but , i guess i should find something good to"
about this man whose won the farmer 's daughter
and will soon become my son-in-law today
mama left eight years ago december
and it was hard to be a dad and mama
"but , somehow we made home of this old farmhouse"
and love was all my baby ever knew
he could be the richest man in seven counties
and not be good enough to take her hand
"but , he says he really loves the farmer 's"
and i know the farmer 's daughter loves the man
well wo n't you lend your lungs to me
mine are collapsing
plant my feet and bitterly breathe
up the time that 's passing
and breath i 'll take and breath i 'll give
and pray the day 's not poison
stand among the ones that live
in lonely indecision
fingers walk the darkness down
mind is on the midnight
gather up the gold you 've found
you fool it 's only moonlight
and if you try to take it home
your hands will turn to butter
you better leave this dream alone
try to find another
salvation sat and crossed herself
called the devil partner
wisdom burned upon a shelf
who 'll kill the raging cancer
seal the river at its mouth
take the water prisoner
fill the sky with screams and cries
bathe in fiery answers
jesus was an only son
and love his only concept
strangers cry in foreign tongues
and dirty up the doorstep
and i for one and you for two
ai n't got the time for outside
just keep your injured looks to you
we 'll tell the world that we tried
i take off time to time
with those crazy friends of mine
head out on steel horses
with wheels and we ride
we burn up that road to mexico
blend in with the desert
just we amigos
and we roll
cowboys like us sure do have fun
"racin ’ the wind , chasin ’ the sun"
take the long way around back to square one
today we ’ re just outlaws out on the run
"there ’ ll be no regrets , no worries and"
for cowboys like us
"we talk about livin ’ , babies , and women"
all that we ’ ve lost and all we ’
"we sing about true love , lie about things we"
"drink one more cold one , come morning ’ get"
and we roll
cowboys like us sure do have fun
"racin ’ the wind , chasin ’ the sun"
take the long way around back to square one
today we ’ re just outlaws out on the run

there was a world outside my door
i was n't in touch with anymore
there was a way i used to feel
i knew what was and was n't real
i felt safe on shaky ground
and i was a master of despair
making believe i did n't care
i should n't be standing here today
after all the crazy things i 've done
i 'm ready to fall and that 's ok
i ran as far as i could run
you won
out of a world turned upside down
it took some time to come around
out of a dream you made me whole
yes you did
you lit a fire down in my soul
i should n't be standing here today
after all the crazy things i 've done
i 'm ready to fall and that 's ok
i ran as far as i could run
you won
i should n't be standing here today
after all the crazy things i 've done
i 'm ready to fall and that 's ok
i ran as far as i could run
you won
and you won
i 'm ready to fall
i thought i knew what i was doing
i thought i was in control
i thought nobody could slow me down
but what did i know
"i was just a kid , a motherless child"
no one to watch over me i was runnin '
free of all responsibility 'til my life
and my love for myself caught up with me
"yeah , it caught up with me"
"and now i 'm ( ready to fall ) ,"

a heartsong melody play like a symphony
the sweetest music i have ever known
a song of joy and pain
the mountain angels sing
"a bittersweet refreign of my smokey mountain home , heartsong"
farmer 's daughter if you will
and i often wonder still
in memories where i rammbled as a child
makes me cry and makes me laugh
my reflections on the past
"and the family , friends , and faith that shaped"
ragged clothes and hand-me-downs
just enough to go around
but the sweetest things in life are always free
like the songs the birds would sing
and the sweet new grass of spring
and the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree
and i recall the thrill and joy
of a smokey mountain boy
i remember my first kiss and my first love
and the songs i 'd song and write
and the dreams i 'd clutch so tight
and the loved ones that gave me that extra shove
and in that little house ' a prayer
where i spent many hour
prassin ' god and liftin ' up his name
and asking him to lead and to keep watch over
as i headed up that rocky road to fame
"and now this , smokey mountain girl has been all"
but it makes no difference just how far i roam
i still cling to that part that is so dear
my faith in god and memories of home
doing what you love has a high price to pay
"some put on a suit , but he ran the"
drums drown out the yuppies
and the one 's who could n't dream
cause the freedom music gave him was worth more than
they do n't know
what they got
until it 's gone
like it or not
you live on love
you try to do what 's right
we 're all here waiting for our silver invitation
to our big band in the sky
rollin down the windows
trying hard to fight the sleep
money 's never much for a band in tennessee
another night of plain '
to a crowd with no ears
wan na hear the songs they know
and fill their bellies full of beer
but they do n't know
what they got
until it 's gone
like it or not
you live on love
you try to do what 's right
we 're all here waiting for our silver invitation
to our big band in the sky
and when he closed his eyes
fell into a dream that never dies
and when the thunder comes
you can hear his kick drum in the sky
feel the rain
fall from our eyes
cause we do n't know
what we got
until it 's gone
like it or not
you live on love
you try to do what 's right
for him there 's no more waiting
got his silver invitation
to do a little playing
for the big band in the sky
she left without leaving a number
said she needed to clear her mind
he figured she 'd gone back to austin
cause she talked about it all the time
it was almost a year before she called him up
3 rings and an answering machine is what she got
"if you 're calling about the car , i sold"
if this is tuesday night i 'm bowling
if you got something to sell you 're wasting your
i 'm not buying
if its anybody else wait for the tone you know
p.s . if this is austin i still love you
the telephone fell to the counter she heard
but she could n't believe what kind of man would
hang on that long what kind of love that must
she waited 3 days and then she tried again
she did n't know what she 'd say but she
if its friday night i 'm at the ball game
and first thing saturday if it do n't rain
i 'm headed out to the lake and i 'll
all weekend long but i 'll call you back when
sunday afternoon and p.s . if this is austin i
well this time she left her number but not another
and then she waited by the phone on sunday evening
and this is what he heard
if you 're calling about my heart its still yours
i should have listened to it a little more
and it would n't have taken me so long to
and by the way boy this is no machine you
ca n't ya tell this is austin and i still
i know this dress i 'm wearing does n't hide
when he left he promised me that he 'd be
the sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow
and time is running out for me i wish that
he 's been gone so long when he left the
and i have seen a spring and summer pass and
and any time a tiny face will show itself cause
but i wo n't have a name to give it
my parents did n't understanding when they found out they
from the home place
my daddy said if folks found out he would be
my mother said i was a fool and she did
but everything would be all right cause soon he would
i loved him more than anything and i could not
he was the only man i 'd loved and i
he could n't leave me here like this i know
he would n't make me go through this so long
my body aches the time is here it 's lonely
our baby has been born but something 's wrong it
i guess in some strange way she knew she 'd
and dying was her way of telling me he was

you might wake up some morning
to the sound of something moving past your window in
and if you 're quick enough to rise
you 'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone 's fading
out on the new horizon you may see the floating

"jesus our brother , kind and good"
was humbly born in a stable wood
and the friendly beasts around him stood
"jesus our brother , kind and good ."
"`` i , '' said the donkey , shaggy and"
`` i carried his mother up hill and down ;
i carried her safely to bethlehem town . ''
"`` i , '' said the donkey , shaggy and"
"`` i , '' said the cow , all white"
`` i gave him my manger for a bed ;
i gave him my hay to pillow his head .
"`` i , '' said the cow , all white"
"`` i , '' said the sheep with curly horn"
`` i gave him my wool for his blanket warm
he wore my coat on that christmas morn . ''
"`` i , '' said the sheep with curly horn"
"`` i , '' said the dove from the rafters"
`` cooed him to sleep that he should not cry
"we cooed him to sleep , my lovw and i"
"`` i , '' said the dove from the rafters"
"`` i , '' said the camel , yellow and"
"`` over the desert , upon my back ,"
i brought him a gift in the wise men 's
"`` i , '' said the camel , yellow and"
thus every beast remembering it well
in the stable dark was so proud to tell
of the gifts that they gave emmanuel

i 'm the same old girl that i used to
i have n't changed at all
i got the same old walk and the same old

the same old face and the same old smile and
the same old baby blues
"and i 'm still doing the rhumba , baby"

i 'm still doing the rhumba baby

but it 's just fine with me
i got a couple of rhumba steps
you might like to see
i 'm still doing the rhumba baby
i ca n't seem to quit
if my mama catches us doing the rhumba
mama would just pitch a fit
"but i ca n't help myself , it 's much"

never said a prayer 'cause he 's never been taught
they remember and repeat what they 've heard
so i ask who 's really at fault
"so many questions , so few answers"
so many lessons we do n't teach
stumbling through like clumsy dancers
"what will baby be , what will baby be"
what will baby be after baby is grown
what will baby do when baby is out there on
teach the children how to be all they should be

i saw that we had forgotten to take the time
"i , i saw that you could n't care less"
you could n't care less about the lies

we forgot about love
we forgot about faith
we forgot about trust
we forgot about us

our love 's floating out the back door
our love 's floating up in the sky
"in heaven , where it began"
back in god 's hands
you said that you had said all that you had
"you say 'baby , it 's the end of the"
we gave a lot but it was n't enough
we got so tired that we just gave up

there 's a summer place where it may rain or
for within that summer place your arms reach out to
and my heart is free from all care

anywhere when two people share all their hopes all their
and the secret of a summer place ...
i walk up to my door and hate to turn
emptiness is all that waits inside for me

little things like this just make things that much worse
that 's how it is since i live my life
that 's how it is since my house is not
is there a way out for a soul so torn
each day i live i 'm like a prisoner passing
that 's how it is ask anyone who lives alone
that 's how it is when your house is not

"the red-headed stranger from blue rock , montana ,"
rode into town one day .
and under his knees was a ragin ' black stallion
and walkin ' behind was a bay .
"the red-headed stranger had eyes like the thunder ,"
"and his lips , they were sad and tight ."
"his little lost love lay asleep on the hillside ,"
and his heart was heavy as night .
"do n't cross him , do n't boss him ."
he 's wild in his sorrow :
he 's ridin ' an ' hidin his pain .

she drew back in fear at the sight of the
but cast greedy eyes on the bay .
but how could she know that this dancin ' bay
meant more to him than life .
for this was the horse that his little lost darlin
had ridden when she was his wife .

the yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset ;

stay out of the path of the ragin ' black

a drunk man walking down a rainy street
a wood floor and new socks on your bare feet
you look down and suddenly you 're looking up
"whoops , i slipped and fell in love"
a bald tire running on an icy road
a steep hill underneath a foot of snow
a greased pig fallen off a pickup truck
"whoops , i slipped and fell in love"
i hope that you 're feeling the way that i
it 's just like flying but you 're standing still
the birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
"whoops , i slipped and fell in love"
an ice cube hiding on your kichen floor
a bad step leading up to your back door
how 'd i wind up on my butt
"whoops , i slipped and feel in love"
i hope that you 're feeling the way that i
it 's just like flying but you 're standing still
the birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff
"whoops , i slipped and fell in love"
i hope that you 're feeling the way that i
it 's just like flying but you 're standing still
the birds and the bees are sure powerful stuff

"whoops , i slipped and fell in love"
being born was the worse and the first mistake i
"the doctor didnæš° spank me , he just slapped me"
and the cup of love was always quenching someone else
leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt
'cause i was raised an orphan
never wanted as a kid until the year i turned
"then everybody did , strangers pass me back and forth"
men just took me as they pleased
and others had a cinderella slave to cook and clean
though the deck is stacked against you
"win or lose , you have to play"
the hand a life has dealt you
and itæš¯ a gamble either way
on a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton
with the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down
and the dry cracked plains would make me think of
or should i fear what lay before me less than
a 15 year old girl donæš° have no trouble hitching
but sometimes when you 're riding free
youæš£l pay the highest price
on back roads and in back seats
and in a cheap highway motel
but whatæš¯ a few more strangers in a life of
"16 caught me crying , underneath the scarlet light"
on the door steps of a stranger on a cold
when i walked into the parlour here
other pieces seemed to fit
i was good at pleasing strangers
so i made the most of it
either way itæš¯ all a gamble
so view the stakes and know the odds
and lay your cards upon the table
do all the dealing from the top
"a clean shirt , new shoes"
and i do n't know where i am goin '
"silk suit , black tie ( black tie ) ,"
i do n't need a reason why .
they come runnin ' just as fast as they can
'cause every girl 's crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man
"a gold watch , diamond ring ,"
i ai n't missin ' not a single thing
"cufflinks , stick pin ( stick pin ) ,"
when i step out i 'm gon na do you
they come runnin ' just as fast as they can
'cause every girl 's crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man
-- - instrumental -- -
"top coat , top hat ,"
i do n't worry 'cause my wallet 's fat
"black shades , white gloves ,"
lookin ' sharp and lookin ' for love
they come runnin ' just as fast as they can
'cause every girl 's crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man ...
why so lonely why is my world in such a
now he 's gone and yet i guess i still
why so lonely why all this misery
i knew it could n't last he never belong to
if i 'd been smart i would have never taken
he hurt me once before and now he 's done
why so lonely ...
why so lonely why so lonely
oh i 'm blessed and i know i am
god has dealt me a winning hand
a loving woman and a fairy land for me
oh and i ca n't believe it half the time
when i look at her in perfect light
sweet vision every day and night i see
my baby has big green eyes
brighter than the bluest sky
softer than an angel flies
sweeter than a lullaby
and she loves me without design
her picture never leaves my mind
i do n't deserve a love this fine
baby and her big green eyes
oh and i 'm never very far away
even if i 'm in another place
her smile you ca n't erase from me
( instrumental )
oh and i 'm thankful every waking hour
for the love of a gentle flower
a face i will never tire or leave
her picture never leaves my mind
i do n't deserve a love this fine
baby and her big green eyes
a mother wrote a letter asking how much longer must
before you send my boy back home to me
for my eyes are growing dim and i 'm longing
please hurry up and let my boy go free .
the warden read the letter and a tear fell from
sitting down he wrote her this reply
there 's a little box of pine on the 7:29
there 's a valley filled with tears as the train
the night is dark and the world is growing cold
there he 's taking his last ride
down the trail no more he 'll roam
on his face there is a smile
he know he 's going home
the church was filled with people as the organ softly
on their knees the congregation prayed
as they softly sang a hymn for poor widow 's
for he 's happy for he 's going home to
cold winds may blow over the icy sea
i 'll take with me the warmth of thee a
a taste much sweeter than wine
i will return i 'll return i 'll come back
i 'll leave behind i 'll leave behind my heart
and may it e'er remind you of a taste of
a taste much sweeter than wine
i will return i said i 'll return i 'll
she ne'er came back to her love so fair
and so he died dreaming of his kiss her kiss
a taste more bitter than wine
i will return oh i 'll return i 'll come
i 'll come back for the honey and you
i cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
i screamed his name til the neighbors called the cops
i numbed the pain at the expense of my liver

run and hide your crazy and start actin like a
"cause i raised you better , got ta keep it"
even when you fall apart
but this ain ’ t my mama ’ s broken
wish i could be just a little less dramatic
like a kennedy when camelot went down in flames
leave it to me to be holdin the matches
when the fire trucks show up and there ’ s
can ’ t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
sometimes revenge is a choice you got ta make
my mama came from a softer generation
where you get a grip and bite your lip and
"go and fix your make up , girl it ’"
run and hide your crazy and start actin like a
"cause i raised you better , got ta keep it"
even when you fall apart
but this ain ’ t my mama ’ s broken
"powder your nose , paint your toes"
line your lips and keep em closed
"cross your legs , dot your i 's"
and never let em see you cry

someday when our dream world finds us
and these hard times are gone
we 'll laugh and count our blessings
in a mansion all our own
if we both pull together tomorrow 's sure to come
someday we 'll look back and say it was fun
we live on love and pennies
and the day dream out of sight
and i 'm amazed the way you smile
when things do n't turn out right
we climb each hill together each step one by one
and someday we 'll look back and say it was

"7:42 in the morning , 8 seconds before it all"
put your best face on for the world
fake another smile and just pretend
but you 're just putting off the pain
nothing 's ever really gon na change
"so ... let it hurt , let it bleed"
let it take you right down to your knees
let is burn to the worst degree
may not be what you want but it 's what
sometimes the only way around it
is to let love do its work
and let it hurt
yeah let it hurt
"3:28 in the morning , countin ' up the spaces"
you 're getting used to the rocks at the bottom
your heart goes numb but the lonely stays the same
that 's the price you 're bound to pay
and there 's really nothing anyone can say
oh there 's only just one way
"so ... let it hurt , let it bleed"
let it take you right down to your knees
let it burn to the worst degree
may not be what you but it 's what you
sometimes the only way around it
is to let love do its work
so go on yeah let it hurt
let it hurt
you might just find you 're better for it
when you let go and you learn ...
"to let it hurt , let it bleed"
let it take you right down to your knees
sometimes the only way around it
is to let love do its work
so go on and let it hurt
oh let it hurt
"7:42 in the morning , 8 seconds before it all"
well i ai n't had nothing to drink
i knew thats probably what you 'd think
if i dropped by this time of night
remember way back when
i promised you i 'd drop in
at one of those meetings down at the y
"well , they started talkin bout steps you take"
mistakes you make
the hearts you break
and the price you pay
i almost walked away
you could hear a pin drop
when this old man
stood up and said i 'm gon na ' say
like i do every week
for those who do n't know me
it 's the simple things in life
like the kids at home and a loving wife
"that you miss the most , when you lose control"
and everything you love starts to disappear
the devil takes your hand and says no fear
"have another shot , just one more beer"
"yeah , i 've been there , that 's why"
this olâ€™ boy stood up in the aisle
said he 'd been living a life of denial
and he cried as he talked about wasted years
i could n't believe what i heard
it was my life word for word
and all of the sudden it was clear
it 's the simple things in life
like the kids at home and a loving wife
"that you miss the most , when you lose control"
and everything you love starts to disappear
the devil takes your hand and says no fear
"have another shot , just one more beer"
"yeah , i 've been there , that 's why"
i know for us it may be too late
but it would mean the world to me
if you were there when i stand to say
it 's the simple things in life
like the kids at home and a loving wife
"that you miss the most , when you lose control"
and everything you love starts to disappear
the devil takes your hand and says no fear
"have another shot , just one more beer"
"yeah , i 've been there , that 's why"
bartender wo n't you pour me a very strong drink
just keep it coming till i do n't have to
and point out some cowboy that might want to dance
and make sure i get home if you see that
"you see i loved him , he left me for"
i relate to each sad song that ole jukebox has
"i listen to haggard , ole hank , and george"
but why do n't more women sing honky tonk songs
why do n't more women sing honky-tonk songs ?
about the heartaches and the tough breaks
and the men that 's done 'em wrong
there are others just like me that are hurtin '
so why do n't more women sing honky-tonk songs
why do n't more women sing honky tonk songs
honky tonk angels are just queens without thrones
"judge not lest you be judged , who can cast"
why do n't more women sing honky-tonk songs
( all you lonely women sing )
why do n't more women sing honky tonk songs
about the heartaches and the tough breaks
and all the men that 's done us wrong
there 's a whole lotta women i know would sing
so why do n't more women sing honky tonk songs
why do n't more women sing honky tonk songs

down every road there 's always one more city
"i 'm on the run , the highway is my"
i raised a lot of cane back in my younger
while mama used to pray my crops would fail
i 'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways :
outrun the law or spend my life in jail
i 'd like to settle down but they wo n't
a fugitive must be a rolling stone
down every road there 's always one more city
"i 'm on the run , the highway is my"
i 'm lonely but i ca n't afford the luxury
of having one i love to come along
she 'd only slow me down and they 'd catch
for he who travels fastest goes alone
i 'd like to settle down but they wo n't
a fugitive must be a rolling stone
down every road there 's always one more city

you do n't know the meaning
of the words `` i love you so ''
but when you 've found your one love
then - you 'll know
you do n't know the heartache
or the laughter you 'll forego
until you 've lost that one love
then - you 'll know
now you pretend to care for me
"but , honey , if you do"
why do n't you give the kind of kiss
i always give to you

go on and find a new love

a baby 's born in the middle of the night
in the local delivery room
"they grab his feet , smack him until he cries"
he goes home the next afternoon
"before you know it , he 's off to school"
and then he graduates in may
goes out and gets a phd . and then cures
wins the noble prize and saves a million different lives
the world 's a better place for all he 's
it 's funny when you think about the reason he
is all because two people fell in love
right now at a picnic shelter
down by cane creek
"you 'll find potato salad , hot dogs and baked"
the whole wilson family 's lined up filling their paper
and they 've drove or flown in here from fifteen
stanley wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
that miss emma tucker was the one
now five generations get together every june
and all because two people fell in love
"yeah , there ai n't nothing not affected"
when two hearts get connected
"all that is , will be or ever was"
every single choice we make
every breath we get to take
is all because two people fell in love
while i recall a young man
who was drifting aimlessly
and a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
but in a little cafe right off of 14th avenue
with a whole lot of help from up above
we met and things sure turned around for me and
and all because two people fell in love
"and baby , there ai n't nothing not affected"
when two hearts connected
"all that is , will be or ever was"
i 'm glad your dad could not resist
your momma 's charms and you exist
all because two people fell in love
you know to me it 's all so clear
everyone of us is here
all because two people fell in love

i 've got my faults but i do have my
a
i do have my ways
e
that show off the best side of me
a
when you least expect it
e
you do n't know how good i can be
"only you , can make this world seem right"
"only you , can make the darkness bright"
"only you , and you alone , can thrill me"
and fill my heart with love for only you
"only you , can make this change in me"
"for it 's true , you are my destiny"
"when you hold my hand , i understand"
the magic that you do
you 're my dream come true
my one and only you
"only you , can make this change in me"
"for it 's true , you are my destiny"
"when you hold my hand , i understand"
the magic that you do
you 're my dream come true
my one and only you
one and only you ....
i had no idea
that you would be here
as you smile from the corner
and raise up your beer
and then you touch my hand
when you walked by
and i get a contact high
this ai n't no crazy party
"no , it ai n't no bonnaroo"
hell the only thing smoking
in this place is you
that dress is on fire girl
when i look in your eyes
oh i get a contact high
what you do to me baby
being here in this room
is so damn frustrating
that i ca n't hold you
and it 's driving me crazy
i can smell your perfume
and it goes to my head
so i take a deep breath and i hold it
now the whole world is hazy
and i 'm dazed and confused
thing is i ai n't touched nothin '
nothin ' but you
and that 's even just barely
we 've been laughing and talking all night
but oh baby
being here in this room
it 's driving me crazy
"not holdin ' , not holdin ' you"
and it 's just conversation
and second-hand perfume
but it goes to my head
so i take a deep breath
and i hold it
oh i get a contact high
get a contact high
i bless the day i found you
i want to stay around you
and so i beg you
let it be me
do n't take this heaven from one
if you must cling to someone
now and forever
let it be me
each time we meet love
i find complete love
without your sweet love
what would life be
so never leave me lonely
tell me you love me only
and that you 'll always
let it be me
why do i wait for your call every night
sit next to a phone that never rings
"i do , because i 'm lonely"
and lonely people do foolish things .
why do i sit with your picture in sight
when i know all the heartache it brings
"i do , because i 'm lonely"
and lonely people do foolish things .
i find myself at a table for two pretending your
i carry on a conversation with you
pour out my heart to an empty chair
why do i go on fooling myself
when i know what tomorrow will bring .
"one more day i 'll be lonely , and lonely"
"ah , lonely people do foolish things"
one more day i 'll be lonely
"and lonely people , yes , lonely people do foolish"
"baby , i ’ ll be there"
to lift you up
i ’ ll dry your eyes
"oh , when you cry"
when you ’ re alone
and nobody ’ s there to take you through the
"oh , when nothing ’ s right"
call out my name
"oh , don ’ t be ashamed to say you"
"i understand , baby"
sometimes the night can be so dark and cold
no one beside you
and no one to hold
"hold on , hold on"
when you cry
i will dry your eyes
when you fall
i ’ ll lift you up high
you just reach
for these arms of mine
i promise they won ’ t let you go
and i ’ ll make you smile
when you cry
you ’ re always strong
always got a hand to lend to someone else
don ’ t need no one else
what about those times
when that heart inside is crying out for love
"for someone , baby"
someone to lean on when the tears start to fall
lean on me i ’ ll see you through it
"just hold on , hold on"
when you cry
i will dry your eyes
when you fall
i ’ ll lift you up high
you just reach
for these arms of mine
i promise they won ’ t let you go
and i ’ ll make you smile
when you cry
hold on to me
when you ’ re not feeling strong
"hold on , baby , hold on"
when you cry
i will dry your eyes
when you fall
i ’ ll lift you up high
you just reach
"for these arms of mine , baby"
i promise they won ’ t let you go
when you cry
when you cry
when you cry
"oh , baby"
yeah
last night all alone in a barroom i met a
she had ruby red lips and coal black hair and
then she came and sat down at my table and
i found myself wanting to kiss her for temptation was
and i was almost persuaded to strip myself of my
almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
then we danced and she whispered i need you
take me away from here and be my man
then i looked into her eyes and i saw it
and i was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead
almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and
baby i do n't understand
with just a touch of your hand
can make me feel invincible
do you know just where you take me ?
do you know how high you make me ?
i need your kiss like oxygen
with your arms warm around me
when your eyes look deep into me
it 's un-stopable
baby anything is possible
everything i wan na be
any dream i wan na dream
"i can , because of your love"
anywhere i ever go
with all of my heart i know
i am the man i am
because of your love
do n't know how i lived before you
now i live to explore you
take me girl to your secret world
where i could swim in your deep blue passion
or i could feel your love come crashing over me
endlessly
whether your right by my side or
whether you and i are a million miles apart
i can always feel you in my heart
everything i wan na be
any dream i wan na dream
"i can , because of your love"
anywhere i ever go
with all of my heart i know
i am the man i am
because of your love
everything i wan na be
any dream i wan na dream
"i can , because of your love"

one night while out for a ramble
the hour was just about nine
i met a young maiden in frisco
on the corner of geary and pine
on her face there was beauty of nature
and her eyes just seemed to expand
her hair was so rich and so brilliant
entwined in a blue velvet band
we strolled down the street together
in my pocket she placed her small hand
she planted the evidence on me
the girl in the blue velvet band
i heard the scream of the siren
and the girl in the blue velvet band
she left me to face all the trouble
with a diamond that was worth ten grand
they sent me to san quentin for stealing
god knows i 'm an innocent man
the guilty one now she lie 's dying
the girl in the blue velvet band
last night when bed-time was ringin
standing there close to the bars
i fancied i heard a voice calling
far out in the ocean of stars
i 'll be out in a year and i 'm
but i 'll carry the name of a man
that served ten years in prison
for the girl in the blue velvet band
and when i get out i 'll endeavor
to live in some other land
and i 'll bid farewell to old frisco
and the girl in the blue velvet band
might scare me to death
or chill my bones
break my heart
or warm my soul
but since i 'm here and before i go
i 'm gon na find out who i am
late one cold thanksgiving night
"they welcomed me , another 60 's child"
to a family that 's holding tight
"that 's part of who i am , yeah"
i got a mama who prays for me
she fights the devil down on her knees
i ca n't see all that mama sees
but it 's part of who i am
she gave me truth and she watched me grow
i told her lines and i test the rope
then i tried a little bit of everything i know
just to find out who i am
who i am
does it matter anyway
who i am
what i 've seen along the way
who i am
changes a little everyday
with a lot of truth
and an open heart
i just want half a chance
as long as i 'm here and before i go
just to find out who i am
music is my soul 's delight
comes to me both day and night
it gives me wings and it gives me flight
and it 's part of who i am
i hold onto a simple faith
about the choices and the path i take
that through the good and the bad mistakes
"i 'm gon na find out , yeah"
who i am
does it matter anyway
who i am
what i 've lost along the way
who i am
it changes a little everyday
with a lot of truth
and an open heart
i just want half a chance
as long as i 'm here and before i go
just to find out
did it ever really matter
in that big forever plan
who i am and what i 'm here for i
is it wrong to want an answer
try to understand
who i am
does it matter anyway
who i am
what i 've learned along the way
who i am
it changes a little everyday
with a lot of truth
and an open heart
i just want half a chance
as long as i 'm here and before i go
just to find out
who i am
hard times ca n't hold us down forever
hard times are gon na fade away
hard times we ca n't let them stop us darlin
there will be a better day
"tell me you love me , these days i need"
do n't give up on me

"we all need someone , someone to believe in"
this life that we are sharing built on love and
if it takes a lifetime i will never stop my
to build a better life for us
hard times ca n't hold us down forever
hard times are gon na fade away
hard times we ca n't let them stop us darlin
there will be a better day
there will be a better day
high as the wild birds fly
wild and free that 's how i dream
i got to keep on dreaming
we can have what we can not see tomorrow
on the highest mountain
on the highest mountain we can watch those wild birds
"we can drift away , find our own blue sky"
as long as you are with me i 'll never
hard times ca n't hold us down forever
hard times are gon na fade away
hard times we ca n't let them stop us darlin
there will be a better day

i was blind
but now i see
i 've been throwing horseshoes
over my left shoulder
i 've spent most all my life
searching for that four-leafed clover
"yet you ran with me ,"
chasing my rainbows
"and honey i love you , too"
that 's the way love goes .
"that 's the way love goes , babe"
that 's the music god made
for all the world to sing
its never old ; it grows
losing makes me sorry
"well now , `` honey , do n't worry ."
dont u kno i love u too
that 's the way love goes .
thats the way love goes babe
thats the music god made
for all the world to sing
it 's never old it grows
losin makes me sorry
"you say , honey i dont worry"
i love you too
thats the way love goes
especially with my head pounding
and lying helpless in my bed
i long for you and your expert hands
to ease this white heat from my head
and you would boast that you knew
all the pressure points inside
and you could just as easily kill me
beneath the desire that i hide
but as your patient i knew
that your healing powers had grown
from a sore that 's far far deeper
than this heart where the pain was born
with my head again clear
i think of words to send to you
to coax you back to my side
but always leave out `` i love you ''
and then through my front door
a picture of a faraway land
and to with love on the back
and once again i reach for my pen
fight and scratch
duet by dolly parton and porter wagoner
copyright 1970
fight and scratch fight and scratch that 's all we
there surely must be more to love than to fight
you you to fight and scratch with you
well you just bought a foal last month now you
it looks like you could n't understand my paycheck ai
well what about the dough you lose in them poker
i figured you 'd mention that smart aleck
yeah and that brand new boat and that fishin '
but no uhhuh i do n't reckon that 'd count
fight and scratch fight and scratch ...
sometimes i swear i think that you 're the devil
cause when you 're mad you oughta see the fire
well you do n't look so cute yourself when you
and if you do n't like the way i look
fight and scratch fight and scratch ...
well i love you and you love me but we
but the way we fight you would n't know that
we just fight like cats and dogs we 'll leave
for what excitement would we have if we did n't
fight and scratch fight and scratch ...
why do n't you drop dead oh you 'd like
why do n't you keep your big mouth shot
well why do n't you just make me if you
yeah and i could whip you with both hands tied
yeah you just try it with me and i 'll
with a stick of soap that 's good catfish
what 's a catfish why 'd you call me that
they 're all mouth and no brains boy that 's
it 's all i can do to keep from laughin
that 's funny you sure are a fynny little fellow
"i once had a love , a true and lasting"
but the fool in me came out one night .
and with her loving eyes
"she saw right through my eyes ,"
and she changed the night
i stepped across the line .
i should have watched that first step
it was a mighty big step
when i started steppin ' out of line .
though she 's still lovin ' me
it 's not the way it used to be .
that first step did something to her mind .
i watched her slip away
a little more every day
and my conscience could n't live
with all that pain .
she 's growing colder since the day i told her
and the love we had will never be the same
i should have watched that first step
it was a mighty big step
when i started steppin ' out of line .
though she 's still lovin ' me
it 's not the way it used to be
that first step did something to her mind
found some letters you wrote me this morning they told
now they 're gone i 'd burned them to ashes
do n't want nothing to remind me of you
sold the house we once planned together said goodbye to
then i moved to a faraway city trying hard to
i 've been a rolling stone all my life
"flying all alone , flying blind"
"i 've seen it all , i 've been around"
i 've been lost and i 've been found but
who i am with you is who i really want
you 're so good for me
"and when i 'm holdin ' you , it feels"
"yeah , a better man is who i am with"
i 've got a ways to go on this ride
but i got a hand to hold that fits just
"you make me laugh , you make me high"
"you make me want to hold on tight , 'cause"
who i am with you
because of you i 'm a lucky man
you 're the best part of who i am
"yes , who i am with you"
this never was one of the great romances
but i thought you 'd always have those young girl
eyes
for now they looking tired and bitter glances
at the ghost of a man walkin ' round in
he gets the feeling that he should belong here
but there 's no welcome in the window anyway
and he looks down for a number on his key-chain
cause it feels more like a hotel everyday
there 's a stranger in the house nobody 's seen
everybody says he 's takin ' my place
there 's a stranger in the house no one will
everybody says he looks like me

and now you say you 've got no expectations
but i know you also miss those carefree days
and for all the angry words that passed between them
she still ca n't understand him when he says
there 's a stranger in the house ...
he looks like me
i can throw a line
but i ca n't reel it in
i can throw a dart
but i ca n't make it stick
the thought of loving you just makes me sick
i do n't have the nerve to use my heart
i do n't have the nerve to use my heart
i can write the line
but i ca n't sing the song
i can call my momma
but i wo n't go home
the thought of loving you just makes me sick
i do n't have the nerve to use my heart
i do n't have the nerve to use my heart
i wo n't throw a punch
but i will turn my cheek
i do n't go to church no more
but that 's what i believe
i do n't give two shits no more
or so i say
it would n't make a difference
to you anyway
that thought of loving you just makes me sick
i do n't have the nerve to use my heart
i do n't have the nerve to use my heart
i do n't have the nerve to use my heart
i do n't have the nerve to use my heart
i do n't have the nerve to use my heart
use my heart
he did n't have the answers
to half the questions his son ask him
a child ’ s mind is a curious thing
but when his son hugged him and said dad
you know i love you
how much do you love me
daddy did n't have to think
with his arms open wide
just as far as they could go
he said as far as i can reach
is not enough to show
i would give my life for you
you are my flesh and blood
i love you this much
she stood there crying
broken-hearted
looking up at him
and said why are you doing this
he looks down at her wanting to hold her
and wipe her tears away
he has to leave and that 's the way it
she gave her son one last kiss
with her arms open wide
just as far as they could go
she said as far as i can reach
is not enough to show
i would give my life for you
you are my flesh and blood
i love you this much
and they raised his broken body above the crowd
drove in the nails as the rain came down
with his arms open wide
just as far as they could go
he said as far as i can reach
is not enough to show
i would give my life for you
you are my flesh and blood
i love you this much
i love you this much

beating faster in your chest
i wan na feel you holding onto me
and make me hold my breath

we 'll make a falling star wish
one more slow kiss
what are we waiting on ?

i pinch myself
sometimes to make sure i 'm not in a dream
that 's how it seems
i close my eyes and breathe in the sweetest moments
it feels like home
and here i am
i want to be your everything
there you are
turning winter into spring
and everyone that sees you
always wants to know you
and everyone that knows you
always has a smile
you 're a standing ovation
after years of waiting
for a chance to finally shine
everyone calls you amazing
yeahhhh
i just call you mine
i fall apart
and just a word from you
somehow seems to fix
whatever 's wrong
ohh
you reach into the weakest moments and remind me that
you got ta know
i 'd be a fool not to see or even
that you 're more than i deserve
cause everyone that sees you
always wants to know you
and everyone that knows you
always has a smile
you 're a standing ovation
after years of waiting
for a chance to finally shine
everyone calls you amazing
i just call you mine
nothing makes sense when you 're not here
as if my whole world disappears
without you what 's the point of it
cause everyone that sees you
always wants to know you
and everyone that knows you
always has a smile
you 're the dream that i 've been chasing
after years of waiting
for a chance to finally shine
everyone calls you amazing
i just call you mine

one more night away from you
one more phone call
to say i 'll be home soon
i 'm just so tired
of all the distance in between
all i really need is you with me
"i miss your voice , i miss your smile"
i wish i could give you
a kiss from a thousand miles
"sleep well , my love"

i know it 's hard when i 'm so far
and these words can only go so far to say
"i miss you 're voice , i miss your smile"
i wish i could give you
a kiss from a thousand miles

the plane is on the runway
and it 's right on time
it 's been so long since he left me here
to make it on my own
and then he called
he said his life was empty and he 's sorry
he 's changed his mind
he tells me that he still loves me like he
and now he 's coming home .
and now i see him smiling
and he 's waving as he steps upon the runway
"yes , i can see him running now"
and i can hear him calling out my name
the tears are falling in my eyes
'cause now i have to find a way to tell
that i could n't wait forever
and i made a new life with another man .
"well , here he comes , the man i loved"
but grew tired of waiting for
he stayed away
and i just could n't stand to be alone
i 'll never know just why he left me here
and i still love him so
but now it 's done
i could n't wait forever and i wish i had
'cause now he 's coming home .
"yes , here he comes , yes here he comes"
"no , i could n't wait forever and i wish"

this has been the longest night i 've ever known
it 's so long since i felt this alone
sometimes i just ca n't see the way things are
now that the twilight has gone
now there is nothing left to say there you go
been in the dark so long we could n't see
now that the twilight is gone
the first step is the hardest part where do we
only after a hardened heart do tears finally disappear
and i 'm on my own now that the twilight

lonely nights and crazy days we sure let it slip
just tell me life goes on is there a new

the moon is full and my arms are empty
all night long i 've pleaded and cried
you always said the day that you would leave me
would be a cold day in july
your bags are packed not a word is spoken
i guess we said everything with good-bye
time moves so slow and promises get broken
on this cold day in july
sun 's comin ' up comin ' up down on
children shout as they 're running out to play
head in my hands here i am
standing in my bare feet
watching you drive away
watching you drive away
you said that we were gon na last forever
you said our love would never die
it looks like spring and
it feels like sunny weather
but it 's a cold day in july
on sun 's comin ' up comin ' up
down on main street
children shout as they 're running out to play
whoa head in my hands
here i am standing in my bare feet
watching you drive away
watching you drive away
the moon is full and my arms are empty
all night long how i 've pleaded and cried
you always said the day that
"you would leave me ,"
would be a cold day in july
"i 'm still here , but yet i 'm gone"
i do n't play guitar or sing my songs
they never defined who i am
the man that loves you 'til the end
you 're the last person i will love
you 're the last face i will recall
"and best of all , i 'm not gon na"
not gon na miss you
i 'm never gon na hold you like i did
or say i love you to the kids
you 're never gon na see it in my eyes
it 's not gon na hurt me when you cry
i 'm never gon na know what you go through
all the things i say or do
all the hurt and all the pain
one thing selfishly remains
i 'm not gon na miss you
i 'm not gon na miss you

god and country music
like whiskey and a prayer
like johnny cash 's arm
'round billy graham
god and country music
they both never really change
you find 'em when you need 'em
where you stand
there 's always lost in the found
and darkness in the `` i saw the light ''
it 's livin ' in those small towns
in some church or backroad honky tonk tonight
it 's a dance between the sin and the salvation
"come hell or high water , there 's two things"
god and country music
god and country music
god and country music
they both show you the truth
they 've seen the low of the valley
and the highs of the mountains too
folded hands and guitar strings
jukebox preachers and angels sing
call you like they knew ya
between the hell and hallelujah
there 's always lost in the found
and darkness in the `` i saw the light ''
it 's still livin ' in those small towns
in some church or backroad honky tonk tonight

i 've walked through many towns with fortunes lost and
seen the beauty of this land made by nature and
but when i leave i do n't look back for
seen the lawlest in the law you beat all i
[ guitar ]
i 've dreamed a million miles about your eyes and
i know i 've loved the best i ca n't
i 've scanned the skies of blue for just one
but they threw away the mold of a love that
your heart would never thought you beat all i ever
there ’ s a big brown cloud in the city
and the country side a scene .
the price of life is to high to give up
it ’ s rather come down again .
when world wide war ’ s is over and done
and the dream of peace comes true .
we ’ ll all be drinking that free bubble up
and eat that rainbow stew .
when they ’ ll found out how to burn water
and the gasoline car is gone
when an airplane flies without any fuel
and the sunlight heats our home
one of these days when the air clears up
and the sun comes shining through
we ’ ll all be drinking that free bubble up
and eat that rainbow stew .
eat that rainbow stew in a silver spoon
underneath that sky are blue
we ’ ll all be drinking that free bubble up
and eat that rainbow stew .
you don ’ t have to get high to get
just think about what ’ s in store
when people start doing what they odd to be doing
and they wont be booing no more
when a president goes through the white house door
does what he says he ’ ll do
we ’ ll all be drinking that free bubble up
and eat that rainbow stew
eat that rainbow stew in a silver spoon
underneath that sky are blue
we ’ ll all be drinking that free bubble up
and eat that rainbow stew
"he 's halfin ' his sandwich , his chips and"
puttin ' them back in a sack his mama packed
with a sticker that say 's ‘ jesus loves you
"he 's jumpin off the bus , runnin ' in"
talkin ' to mom about his day
hidin ' that paper sack in a baseball glove
ridin ' his bike straight to the freeway
where there 's an old man with a shoppin '
with a dirty face and a purple heart
who 's sayin ' son you 'll never know how
boy say 's
would n't you do this for me
if i were reachin ' out to you
would n't you give me food to eat if i
would n't you do this for me
"tonight , that little boy 's dad is flyin '"
it 's pourin ' rain as he leaves the road
he 's rolling down that concrete bank
through the flames and the broken glass
an old man takes his hand
finds a cell phone on the backseat
he 's sayin ' get here fast as you can
pulls him safely from that flooding ditch
man asked why 'd you risk your life to save
he said
would n't you do this for me
if i were reachin ' out to you
"would n't you try to save my life , if"
would n't you do this for me
now he 's layin ' in that hospital bed prayin
"and he ca n't help but ask him ,"
"lord , did you put that beggar there"
as a nurse pulls back the curtains
all he can see is a billboard sign
a sixty foot jesus hangin ' on the cross
"at the bottom , just one line"
would n't you do this for me
would n't you do this for me
would n't you
i 'm living in two worlds dividing my time
unhappy in your world and lonesome in mine
when i 'm in your world i just pretend that
then i drift in my world so cold and alone
i 'm living in two worlds ...
old friends in your world are new friends to me
so i ca n't take part in your old memories
our love shared in two worlds that do n't turn
we each have our own worlds and neither can change
i 'm living in two worlds ...
it 's ten pm and i should have made the
the moon was out and the clouds came in and
my suitcase is over there somehow i just do n't
cause i do n't want to be anywhere but right
the rains came down and i should have made an
where i 'd rather be if it ca n't be
it 's so warm in here and i want to
and there is no pain or fear right here tonight
with tomorrows dawn i will carry on what i 've
it 's not a matter of my faith or of
it just seems so insane to strike out in the
when it 's so easy to remain right here tonight
"hand to mouth ,"
i 've been livin ' from hand to mouth
"days are gettin ' longer ,"
nights are gettin ' colder
since you 've been gone
"hand to mouth ,"
i 've been livin ' from hand to mouth
"do n't you worry , honey , do n't you"
somehow i get along
"movin ' is my little game ,"
i never felt the taste of fame
been on the road since i was just a child
"workin ' here , then i 'm gone ,"
never in one place too long
it 's enough to drive a poor man wild
"i 've been livin ' from hand to mouth ,"
i 've been livin ' from hand to mouth
"do n't you worry , honey , do n't you"
somehow i get along
i 'm sorry for the times you 've cried
they were the times i 've laughed and lied
i really did n't know how much i cared
and now i wish to spend more time
to keep your love and ease your mind
there 's nothing quite the same
when it 's not shared
( sara evans/james leblanc )
i 've been trying to break down your walls
but i do n't know how to get through
you say that you want me
you say that you need me
"but baby , i need more from you"

and lead me to where you are
you know i 'll follow
to show me the way to your heart

but you 've just got to believe
i will never lie to you
and i will never hurt you
"baby , i 'm asking please"
you 've got ta take my hand
and lead me to where you are
you know i 'll follow
to show me the way to your heart

and lead me to where you are
you know i 'll follow
to show me the way to your heart

and lead me to where you are
"baby , you know i 'll follow"
darlin if you think back
to the heartbroken past
before we found each other
"it 's so amazing , it 's almost crazy"
what a difference lookin through the eyes of love
"life is good , the grass is green"
the good lord smilin on you and me
gon na knock on wood

"people stop me on the street , thinkin i 'm"

"ooo , ooo , ooo-come on ,"
"still feels good-oh , oh , oh"
that old t-shirt you wear to bed
hangin ' off your shoulder by a thread
the one you ripped off me when
we first met
still feels good
that old familiar song blarin '
from my car
"we know every note , every word"
by heart
puts a smile on your face 'cause
you know it 's ours
and it still feels good
your fingers hooked around
my belt loops
leanin ' up against my ride
remember that first time i touched you
it does n't matter-i 've held you a
million times
"oh , and it still feels good"
"we made some crazy plans , had some"
crazy dreams
and now that we 've reached
a few you would think
that it would get old to you and me
"but it still feels good , still feels good"
"oh , your fingers hooked around"
my belt loops
leanin ' up against my ride
remember the first time i touched you
"it does n't matter , i 've held you-"
i 've touched you
i 've felt you-i 've loved you-
and it still feels good
"yeah and it still feels good , baby"
"yeah , it still feeld good-yeah , yeah , yeah"

"still feels good , baby"
i wandered so aimless my heart filled with sin
i would n't let my dear savior in
then jesus came like a stranger in the night
praise the lord i saw the light
i saw the light i saw the light
no more darkness no more night
now i 'm so happy no sorrow in sight
praise the lord i saw the light
just like a blind man i wandered alone
worries and fears i claimed for my own
then like the blind man that god gave back his
praise the lord i saw the light

in the strength of another man 's words
"but i 've got a girl , thank you lord"

here we all are at the start of another thousand
all those love stories yet to be told

"some glad morning when this life is over ,"
i 'll fly away ;
"to a home on god 's celestial shore ,"
i 'll fly away ( i 'll fly away )
"i 'll fly away , oh glory"
i 'll fly away ;
"when i die , hallelujah , by and by ,"

sorry i deceived you
you made it hard for me to stay in line
"loving you came easy , but for reasons i 'll"
when the sun goes down and the cat goes out
the mice will play
last week you went to vegas with your friends
and left me here alone
i did n't mind you leavin '
but it hurts when you do n't call me when
see my mind begins to wander
and i 'll find someone to take the hurt away
when the sun goes down and the cat goes out
the mice will play
"loving you came easy , but for reasons i 've"
when the sun goes down and the cat goes out
the mice will play
you might wake up some morning
to the sound of something moving past your window in
and if you 're quick enough to rise
you 'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone 's fading
out on the new horizon
you may see the floating motion of a distant pair
and if the sleep has left your ears
you might hear footsteps running through an open meadow
"do n't be concerned , it will not harm you"
it 's only me pursuing something i 'm not sure
"across my dreams , with nets of wonder"
i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
you might have heard my footsteps
echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your
i might have even called your name
as i ran searching after something to believe in
you might have seen me runnin '
through the long abandonned ruins of the dreams you left
if you remember something there
that glided past you followed close by heavy breathing
"do n't be concerned , it will not harm you"
it 's only me pursuing something i 'm not sure
"across my dreams , with nets of wonder"
i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
"across my dreams , with nets of wonder"
i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
"across my dreams , with nets of wonder"
i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
if your mind 's as cluttered
as your kitchen sink
if your heart 's as empty as your diesel tank
if all your white t-shirts have stains
if you 've got some goods and got some ink
"well then , we should be friends"
if you borrow dresses like you borrow time
if you dream all day and drink all night
if you 're looking for love
but willing to fight
over men and momma 's and miller lite
"well then , we should be friends"
i do n't know you well but i know that
and i can judge the cover
'cause i read the book
on losing sleep and gaining weight
on pain and shame and crazy trains
if you paint your nails while
you cut your loss
if you look at them like you 're the boss
if everything your daddy says
is something you can put stock in
"well then , we should be friends"
i do n't know you well but i know that
and i can judge the cover
'cause i wrote the book
on losing sleep and gaining weight
on pain and shame and crazy trains
"one , two , three"
if you use alcohol as a sedative
and bless your heart as a negative
if you ride your wild horse like the wind
if what you see is what you get
"well then , oh , we should be friends"
( alright )
[ outro ]
"well then , oh , we should be friends"
"well then , oh , we can be friends"
and the oil fields fed our family
'neath the amber waves of grain
"god , he was our savior"
though his name was spoke in vain
my dad would leave for work each morning
in the twilight 's last gleaming
`` cause every day i 'd awaken
to the american dream .

"the summer wind , came blowin ' in from across"
"it lingered there , to touch your hair and walk"
"all summer long , we sang a song and we"
"two sweethearts , and the summer wind"
"like painted kites , those days and nights they went"
"the world was new , beneath a blue umbrella sky"
then softer than a piper man one day it called
"i lost you , i lost you to the summer"
"the autumn wind , and the winter wind they have"
"still the days , those lonely days that go on"
guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
"my fickle friend , summer wind , summer wind"
"oh , summer wind , summer wind"
the postman delivered a letter
and it filled her old heart full of joy
but she did n't know 'till she read the inside
it was the last one from her darlin ' boy
"dear mom was the way that it started ,"
i love you so much it went on
mom i did n't know that i loved you so
but i 'll prove it when this war is won

the way that you did when i was a kid
and i 'd come home with mud on my feet
the captain just gave us our orders
and mom i will carry them through
and i 'll finish this letter the first chance i
but for now i 'll just say i love you
the mother 's old hands began to tremble
as she fought against tears in her eyes
but they came unashamed for there was no name
and she knew that her darlin had died
that night as she knelt by her bedside
she prayed 'god above hear my plea
protect all the boys that are fighting this war
and dear god keep america free
i joined the navy to see the world but nowhere
a girl as sweet as cindy the girl i left
i 've sailed the wide world over ca n't get
cindy oh cindy cindy do n't let me down
write me a letter soon and i 'll be homeward
i see her face in every wave her lips kiss
her loving arms reach out for me through calm and
at night i pace the lonely deck caressed by memories
cindy oh cindy ...
i know my cindy 's waitin ' as i walk
her loving arms reach out for me soon i 'll
then my sailing days will be over and no more

last night i had the strangest dream
i ever dreamed before
'cause i dreamed the world
had all agreed to put an end to war
i dreamed i saw a mighty room
filled with women and men
and the papers they were signing said
they 'd never fight again
and when the papers were all signed
and a million copies made
they all joined hands and they bowed their heads
and grateful prayers were prayed
and the people in the streets below
were dancing 'round and 'round
and swords and guns and uniforms
were scattered on the ground
"i was good at the game , when i had"
"nothin to lose , then you started playin ,"
"it changed all of the rules ,"
i stole my share of good hearts in the night
"and for the first time in my life , i"
"i wan na kiss you good morning , lets not"
"and the ending is nowhere in sight ,"
"i wan na hold you all night , and the"
"every day for the rest of my life , from"
i wan na kiss you good morning ..
"its never been me , to open every door ,"
"or leave little notes , or spill my heart on"
"i wan na cross that secret line , that says"
"i wan na drink that lovers wine , fall asleep"
"i wan na kiss you good morning , lets not"
nowhere in sight
"i wan na hold you all night , and the"
"every day for the rest of my life , from"
i wan na kiss you good morning ...
theres no better way than to start everyday lyin next
"so baby at night you can close your eyes ,"
"and tomorrow when you wake up , well im gon"
"im gon na hold you all night , and the"
"everyday for the rest of my life , from now"
"im gon na kiss you good morning , yea yea"
( spoken )
got a call tonight
sayin ' we could still be friends
what a way to say goodbye
what a way to end
they say the darkest hour
is just before dawn
so i 'll just hold my head up
and try to sing my song
better love next time
just do n't let me lose my mind
all i need 's a real friend
to pick me up again
i got ta shake these memories
if there 's another chance for me
i 'll be lookin ' for a sign
wo n't someone help me find
a better love next time
i could sit around and hurt forever over you
but in my heart i know you 're really gone
there must be a reason for the pain i 'm
telling me i 'm not where i belong
better love next time
just do n't let me lose my mind
all i need 's a real friend
to pick me up again
i got ta shake these memories
if there 's another chance for me
i 'll be lookin ' for a sign
wo n't someone help me find
a better love next time
just as soon as i am strong
i 'll be movin ' on
to a better love next time
when you 're five years old
and you walk downstairs
and catch your parents on the couch
playin ' some game
that looks like half-dressed mouth-to-mouth
well it 's a shock to your system
and your brain starts spinnin '
and you make yourself a pact
when i grow up
i ai n't ever gon na do that
"yes , you will"
if your lucky you will know just how that feels
you step into a pair of shoes
that you swore you 'd never fill
you say you wo n't
"but yes , you will"
'fore long you got
your drivers liscence
and the world seems like it 's yours
except for the fact
that you 've got to be home by ten of
and that makes you mad so you throw a fit
and slam the door as you leave the house
you yell `` when i have kids
i 'm not gon na care
how late their out ''
well you know how your grandma and grandpa
are happy just sittin ' 'round the house
wearin ' clothes that are out of date
talkin ' 'bout the old days
and draggin ' photo albums out
and you sure do love them
but i mean come on now
you wo n't ever be that way
oh you can say you wo n't
"but yes , you will"
"each year on mother 's day , the rose i"
but today i 'm saying my first prayer
mama 's lying on her dyin ' bed
"i 've just told mama goodbye , mother 's day"
"like the flowers in may , she withered away"
and my red rose is turnin ' white
"this is the dreaded hour , we all must face"
yet there 's consolation in my heart
she will bloom in the master 's bouquet
"i 've just told mama goodbye , mother 's day"
"like the flowers in may , she withered away"
and my red rose is turnin ' white
her time has come to go and there 's nothin
only hold her hand and say goodbye
mama 's day with her children is through
i 've just told mama goodbye and knelt beside her
"i heard her say , `` i 'll meet you"
where the white roses turn to red ''

friends are never earned they 're a gift from the
and they 're precious beyond human evaluation
but you dare not take them for granted or they
and the warmth of their caring will vanish into the
most of my friends are unknowns they probably wo n't
unless they live and die in a small town
somewhere where nothing much ever happens
but a few of my friends are big people
they 'd made the word ring with laughter down to
they 're famous sensitive talented and their names are household
and yet they 're no more precious in god 's
than those wonderful nobodies who live and die in small
who is your friend he 's someone who warms you
or with an unspoken word in hard times when you
who is your friend he 's someone who holds you
and sighs softly into your hair when no other medicine
a friend is someone who clings his glass against yours
or answers the phone at three in the morning when
and with a few words of encouragement and concern
makes you realize that you 're not really lost at
friends come in both sexes in all shapes and sizes
the most important thing they have in common is their
to share with you your most sky splitting joys
or your deepest most spelling ol ' some sorrows for
sometimes her morning coffee 's way too strong
and sometimes what she says she says all wrong
but right or wrong she 's there beside me
like only a friend would be
and thats close enough to perfect for me
now she 's been known to wear her pants too
and drinking puts her out just like a light
"heaven know 's she 's not an angel , but"
and that 's close enough to perfect for me
she kisses me each morning
and smiles her sleepy smile
and she do n't have to say it
i can see it in her eyes
do n't you worry about my woman
or what you think she ought to be
'cause she 's close enough to perfect for me
well sometimes she gets down and starts to cry
but then again a lady has a right
"she 's everything i ever wanted , she 's all"
she 's close enough to perfect for me
"oh , she 's close enough to perfect for me"
when you see a deer
you see bambi
and i see antlers up on the wall
when you see a lake
you think picnics
and i see a large mouth up under that log
you ’ re probably thinking that you ’ re gon
"in some ways well , maybe you might"
scrub me down dress me up
but no matter what
remember i ’ m still a guy
when you see a priceless french painting
i see a drunk naked girl
you think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
and i ’ d like to give it a whirl
love makes a man do some things he ain ’
and in a weak moment i might walk your sissy
hold your purse at the mall
but remember i ’ m still a guy
and i ’ ll pour out my heart
hold your hand in the car
write a love song that makes you cry
then turn right around
knock some jerk to the ground
‘ cause he copped a feel as you walked by
i can hear you now talking to your friends
saying yeah girls he ’ s come a long way
from dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
and building a fire in a cave
but when you say a backrub means only a backrub
then you swat my hand when i try
well now what can i say at the end of
"honey , i ’ m still a guy"
and i ’ ll pour out my heart
hold your hand in the car
write a love song that makes you cry
then turn right around
knock some jerk to the ground
‘ cause he copped a feel as you walked by
these days there ’ s dudes getting facials
manicured waxed and botoxed
but with deep spray on tans and creamy lotioney hands
you can ’ t grip a tackle box
with all of these men lining up to get neutered
it ’ s hip now to be feminized i don
i ’ ve still got a pair
"yeah , honey i ’ m still a guy"
my eyebrows ain ’ t plucked
theres a gun in my truck
thank god i ’ m still a guy
last night i was pouring out my heart
like a waterfall to you
"and with a one kiss , i was a runaway"
flying off the track to you
i love you came flooding out
"could n't make it stop , could n't shut my"
felt like a fool then i lied and said i
"but i unapologize , meant every word"
wo n't take back the way i feel about you
ca n't unsay what you heard
cause you heard me right
and i wo n't try to fight them back or
i unapologize
you know people say a lot of things that they
and last night i told a little white lie
hoping you 'd forget the scene
where it felt like a movie under that porch light
could n't help myself when you held me tight
said what i meant then i lied and said i
"but i unapologize , meant every word"
wo n't take back the way i feel about you
ca n't unsay what you heard
cause you heard me right
and i wo n't try to fight them back or
for you
i unapologize
oh there 's no time to be holding it out
that i do n't feel anything
oh i shouldnt have said i 'm sorry
i meant every word wo n't take back the way
about you
ca n't unsaid what you heard
cause you heard me right
and i wo n't try to fight them back or
i unapologize
"cause you heard me right , yeah"
"yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah"
i unapologize
it 's twilight and the streetlights arecoming on
i 'm in a stream of cars on this boulevard
i can hardly wait for you to make what went
seem right
it 's been a long hard day so bring on
bring on the night
pull down the shades
lock the world outside and throw the key away
turn on the feeling and turn out the lights
let 's call it a day and bring on the
from nine to five it 's the same old grind
and the only thing that keeps me sane is coming
when the sun goes down you know how to set
let 's put the day behind us and bring on
let 's call it a day and bring the night
empty blue shoes
and empty brown bottles
it 's the vw blues
bare feet to the floor
you just might die
when you make colorado
and the plaines lie behind you
sweet texas behind you
and your mother wo n't hold
you forever
and forever wo n't hold you for long
and that girl with the face of
an angel
she 's the girl with the face that 's
long gone
now those empty blue shoes
they sit by the highway
and those vw blues
they saw 'em pulling away
you know she kissed me goodbye
the last time i saw her
but what she intended
she never would say
and you lover wo n't hold you
forever
and forever wo n't hold you for long
and that girl with the face of
an angel
she 's the girl with the face that 's
long gone
"you can turn me loose , tear me up and"
"cause me shame , drag my name all over town"
makes no difference what you say or what you do
as for me i 'll always be lovin ' you
my love for you was not built on shifting sands
i made a promise long ago and it still stands
go on and do what your heart tells you to
as for me i 'll always be lovin ' you
"you can change your dreams , change your heart"
or change your mind
and just pretend that it all ends with your goodbye
you can walk out and forget the love we knew
as for me i 'll always be lovin ' you
well she puts her dancing shoes on every night
and comes alive there in the smoke beneath the neon
and she don ` t like those hurtin songs
cause she is already lived æ ... ¹m
"she don ` t get the blues , she gives"
well she checks her broken heart there at the door
"she ainæš° looking for romance , sheæš¯ danced that dance"
well i pity the next poor fool that gets caught
"cause she donæš° get the blues , she gives æ"
sheæš¯ been on the losing end of love too many
and she ainæš° gon na go for anything youæš³e got
so before you start let me impart
these few words of wisdom
"she donæš° get the blues , she gives æ ..."

"no she donæš° get the blues , lord she gives"
"we live in two different worlds , dear"
that 's why we 're so far apart
you made your world out of vows that are broken
i built a world in my heart
everyone here tried to warn me
you were just playing a game
"i told them all , we were meant for each"
i thought our worlds were the same
if you stay over in your world
"oh , how my poor heart will pine"
"darling , someday when your memories wander"
wo n't you come over in mine
"we live in two different worlds , dear"
my world is honest and true
"sweetheart , remember when your world gets lonesome"
i 'll still be waiting for you
"firecracker , i heard you callin ' me"
"firecracker , that suits me to a t"
"a tiny stick of dynamite , laced with tnt"
"i 'm a firecracker , hot as i can be"
"now , i 'll explode if you insist on lightin"
if you ignore the danger of breakin ' all my
a ragin ' fire can be ignited from a tiny
"if you do n't pay attention , all hell can"
"i 'm full of fire and passion , wound tight"
"but if you wan na play with fire , be"
standin ' up for who i am and all that
"is makin ' me a firecracker , that 's just"
"firecracker , if you ca n't take thе heat"
"firecracker , just stay away from mе"
that pretty much sums it up
so handle cautiously
i 'm a hunk-a hunk-a burnin ' stuff
and you 'll feel the burn from me
thank you very much !
"boom , boom , bang , bang"
"pow , pow , pow"
i will blow up in your face right here and
"handle with care , with respectability"
you can lose a finger if you 're pointin '
"firecracker , yeah , you can call me that"
"firecracker , ‘ cause i will fight you back"
and i 'm not out for trouble
but if it comes around
i 'll go at you tooth and nail

"firecracker , full of tnt"
"firecracker , just as hot as i can be"
firecracker

i left my old home in the mountains
and the only friends i ever had
and while i rambled this world over
my heart felt so lonely and sad
iâ€™m going back to the old home
back to the place i love so well
where the sweet waters flow and the wildflowers grow
back to the old home on the hill
i know that dear old motherâ€™s waiting
waiting alone on that hill
with the silver in her hair and a twinkle in
in the old cabin home on the hill
years have gone by since i saw her
iã‚â€™ve traveled many a mile
but tonight thereâ€™s a light in the window
and sheâ€™s waiting at the door with a smile
i see christian pilgrims so redeemed from sin
called out of darkness a new life to begin
were you ever in the valley when the way is
did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him
did you ever have them laugh at you and say
the stand that you so boldly for the lord did
did you ever have them mock at you and say
did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him
oh my friends 't is bitter sweet while here on
to follow in the footsteps that our dear savior trod
to suffer with the savior and when the way is
to think of the bitter cup of loneliness with him
saw a man in the movies
who did n't have a heart
how i wish i could give him mine
then i wouldnt have to feel
it breakin all apart
and this emptiness inside
would suit me fine
its time like these
i wish i were the tin man
you could hurt me all you wanted
and i 'd never even know
and i 'd give anything
just to be the tin man
then i would n't have a heart
and i would n't need a soul
i could n't see your leavin coming
it took me by surprise
even now still seems like a dream
but i know i cant be dreaming
cause as i lay down each nite
the pains so great that it wo n't let me
its time like these
i wish i were the tin man
you could hurt me all you wanted
and i 'd never even know
and i 'd give anything
just to be the tin man
and i would n't have a heart
and i would n't need a soul
i 'd give anything
just to be the tin man
and i wouldnt have a heart
and i would n't miss you so
i ca n't sleep
ai n't no sleep a coming i 'm just lying
i 'm in deep
falling deep into the picture in my mind of everything
over at the lake and odwn by the river you
"wan na jump in my car , go wherever you"
'cause i need you by my side
it 's gon na be a long hot summer
we should be together with your feet up on the
singing along with the radio it 's such a beautiful
and when you say my name in the middle of
i swear i see the stars come out
and when you hold my hand in the back of
i 'm just a waiting on the sun to go
the sun to go down
i wan na see
your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first
i got ta be
the one who knows just what to do to you
one chance meeting you were walking by me on the
and that was the beginning of my heart spinning like
it 's gon na be a long hot summer
we should be together with your feet up on the
singing along with the radio it 's such a beautiful
and when you say my name in the middle of
i swear i see the stars come out
and when you hold my hand in the back of
i 'm just a waiting on the sun to go
the sun to go down
the only place that i wan na be is where
'cause any more than a heartbeat away is just too
it 's gon na be a long hot summer
we should be together with your feet up on the
singing along with the radio it 's such a beautiful
and when you say my name in the middle of
i swear i see the stars come out
and when you hold my hand in the back of
i 'm just a waiting on the sun to go
the sun to go down
it 's gon na be a long hot summer
we should be together oh
all i really want is more than this moment right
'cause when you say my name in the middle of
i swear i see the stars come out
and when you hold my hand and i look into
i swear it looks like you 're waiting on the
the sun to go down
oh and i swear it looks like you 're waiting
"oh whoa , oh , waiting on the sun to"
i ca n't sleep
i 'm just lyin ' here thinkin'bout you
chestnuts roasting on an open fire
jack frost nipping at your nose
yuletide carols being sung by a choir
and folks dressed up like eskimos
everybody knows a turkey and some missletoe
help to make the season bright
tiny tots with eyes all aglow
who find it hard to sleep tonight
they know that santa 's on his way
he 's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his
and every mother 's child is gon na spy
to see if reindeer really know how to fly
and so i 'm offering this simple phrase
to kids from one to ninety-four
"although it 's been said many times , many ways"
merry christmas

now i would n't put you on because it really
that day my mama socked it to the harper valley
that day my mama socked it to 'em at the
just the other night a hometown football game
my wife and i ran into my old high school
and as i introduced them the past came back to
and i could n't help but think of the way
she was the one that i 'd wanted for all
and each night i 'd spend prayin ' that god
and if he 'd only grant me this wish i
i 'd never ask for anything again
sometimes i thank god for unanswered prayers
remember when you 're talkin ' to the man upstairs
that just because he does n't answer does n't mean
some of god 's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
she was n't quite the angel that i remembered in
and i could tell that time had changed me
inn her eyes too it seemed
we tried to talk about the old days
there was n't much we could recall
i guess the lord knows what he 's doin '
and as she walked away and i looked at my
and then and there i thankedd the good lord
for the gifts in my life
sometimes i thank god for unanswered prayers
remember when you 're talkin ' to the man upstairs
that just because he may not answer does n't mean
some of god 's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
some of god 's greatest gifts are all too often
some of god 's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
grandma burned the biscuits
nearly took the house down with ’ em
now she ’ s in assisted living
we all knew that day would come
we knew she was too gone to drive
the day she parked on i-65
found her on the shoulder cryin ’
she didn ’ t know where she was
it ’ s like her mind just quit
oh but bring up grandpa
it ’ s like someone flipped a switch
front porch light and a blue desoto
a couple of straws and a coca cola
you can see it all goin ’ down
a handsome boy in army green
"a tear on his face ,"
"down on a knee , shaky voice , a diamond"
she ’ ll put you in that town
tomorrow she won ’ t remember what she did today
"but just ask her ‘ bout ellsworth , kansas ,"
she takes out his medals
a cigar box of letters
sits and scatters pictures
black and whites of days gone by
we started losin ’ her when she lost him
but to hear her carry on
you ’ d swear she ’ s seventeen again
football games and leaves a'cracklin ’
walkin ’ her home in his letter jacket
you can see it all goin ’ down
a perfect night on a front porch glider
saying goodnight for the next three hours
her tired eyes go wide and bright
when she talks about that town
tomorrow she won ’ t remember what she did today
"but just ask her ‘ bout ellsworth , kansas ,"
while the world is fading all around her
sharing a sundae at the counter
he ’ s going on and on about her
but she ’ s right there right now
tomorrow she won ’ t remember what she did today
"just ask about ellsworth , kansas , 1948 ..."

every time my ship comes in
a hurricane blows it out again
stormy weather seems to hang around my door
my sweet bird of paradise
flew the coop on me last night
"oh , and every time it rains , lord do"
i got a letter from the i.r.s
"they said , son , you 're in a hell"
our computer shows you owe ten-thousand more
that machine 's made a bad mistake
'cause that 's more than this poor boy makes
"oh , and every time it rains , lord do"
every time it rains i just wash my car
the whole neighbourhood goes
swimmin ' in my front yard
"well , my mother-in-law says she 's"
stayin ' three weeks more
"oh , and every time it rains , lord do"
just got my car out of the shop
two blocks down the street it stopped
i went to use the telephone at the grocery store
i walked back to my chevrolet
but they towed that sucker away
"oh , and every time it rains , lord do"
every time it rains i just wash my car
the whole neighbourhood goes
swimmin ' in my front yard
"well , my mother-in-law says she 's"
stayin ' three weeks more

i 've got a couple more years on you baby
i 've had more chances to fly and more places
that 's not that i 'm wiser it 's just
more time with my back to the wall
and i 've picked up a couple more years on
i 've walked a couple more roads than you baby
and i 'm tired of running while you 're only
and you 're going somewhere but i 've been to
and found it was nowhere at all
and i 've picked up a couple more years on
[ instrumental ]
saying goodbye girl do n't ever come easy at all
but you 've got to fly cause you 're hearin
someday when you 're older you 'll smile at a
and say i 've got a couple more years on
you 'll say i 've got a couple more years
i 've had more chances to fly and more places
that 's not that i 'm wiser it 's just
more time with my back to the wall
it 's the kind of night that 's so cold
it freezes before it hits the ground
"and when a bum asks for a quarter , you"
"if he 's out tonight , he must be truly"
and i 'm searching all the windows for a last
to prove to you what i said was real
for something small and frail and plastic baby
'cause cheap is how i feel
"half a moon in the sky tonight , bright enough"
to come up with an answer
"to the question , why is it that every time"
my love grows a little stronger
but your memory leaves my stomach churning
feeling like a lie about to be revealed
but i 'll horde all this to myself
'cause cheap is how i feel
it 's not the smell in here that gets to
how i hate the shadows that they cast
and the sound of clinking bottles is the one sure
i 'll always drag with me from my past
i think i 'll find a pair of eyes tonight
and maybe strike a deal
"your body for my soul , fair swap"
'cause cheap is how i feel
billy never made the football team
cause billy 's size was small
but billy 's brother was a mighty lad
and played a lot of highschool ball
and billy 's daddy never favored him
he catered to the bigger guys
but later on in a bigger way
billy overcame his size
the years flew by and billy grew
but he never got very big
we called him shorty but he never got mad
he was always good for a dig
and we paid no mind when he fell in line
and left with the other guys
and the sargent laughed at his skinny frame
but billy overcame his size
billy overcame his size
yeah billy overcame his size
later on in a bigger way
bill overcame his size
billy 's brother made a football star
and the biggest man in town
and the scholarship that kept him home
never seemed to bring him down
but on the other hand his brother bill
put pride in his daddy 's eyes
when he died to save those other men
billy overcame his size
billy overcame his size
billy overcame his size
when he died to save those other men
billy overcame his size

man you better let go
you ca n't hold on to
what belongs to me
and do n't belong to you
i caught you looking
with your roving eye
so mister you do n't have to act
so surprised
if it 's her you want
i do n't care about that
you can have my girl
but do n't touch my hat
i grew up lonesome
on the open range
and that cold north wind
can make a man feel strange
my john b. stetson
was my only friend
and we 've stuck together
through many a woman
so if it 's her you want
i do n't care about that
you can have my girl
but do n't touch my hat
my mama told me
son to be polite
take your hat off
when you walk inside
but the winds of change
they fill the air
and you ca n't set your hat down
just anywhere
so if you plead not guilty
i 'll be the judge
we do n't need no jury
to decide because
i wear a seven
and you 're out of order
'cause i can tell from here
you 're a seven and a quarter
but if it 's her you want
i do n't care about that
you can have my girl
but do n't touch my hat
if it 's her you want
i do n't care about that
you can have my girl
but do n't touch my hat
no it never complains
and it never cries
and it looks so good
and it fits just right
but if it 's her you want
i do n't care about that
you can have my girl
but do n't touch my hat
you can have my girl
but do n't touch my hat
you can have my girl
but do n't touch my hat
"here i am , oh here i am , here"
if you need a love that 's true
need someone to stand by you
"here i am , oh here i am , here"
if you need a helping hand
need someone to understand
"here i am , oh here i am , here"
"here i am , i 'm reaching out"
to give you love that you 're without
i can help you find what you 've been looking
"here i am , come to me"
take my hand 'cause i believe
i can give you all the love you need and
"oh here i am , oh here i am ,"
my world is such an empty place
i need someone to fill the space
"and here i am , oh here i am ,"
'cause i 've got so much love to give
i need someone to share it with
"and here i am , oh here i am ,"
"here i am , i 'm reaching out"
to give you love that you 're without
i can help you find what you 've been searching
"here i am , come to me"
take my hand 'cause i believe
i can give you all the love you need and
"oh here i am , oh here i am ,"
"oh here i am , oh here i am ,"
"here i am , oh here i am , here"
i hope you never lose your sense of wonder
you get your fill to eat
but always keep that hunger
may you never take one single breath for granted
god forbid love ever leave you empty handed
i hope you still feel small
when you stand beside the ocean
"whenever one door closes , i hope one more opens"
promise me you 'll give faith a fighting chance
and when you get the choice to sit it out
i hope you dance
i hope you dance
i hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
never settle for the path of least resistance
living might mean taking chances
but they 're worth taking
lovin ' might be a mistake
but it 's worth making
do n't let some hell bent heart
leave you bitter
when you come close to selling out
reconsider
give the heavens above
more than just a passing glance
and when you get the choice to sit it out
i hope you dance
( time is a wheel and constant motion always )
i hope you dance
( rolling us along )
i hope you dance
( tell me who )
i hope you dance
( wants to look back on their youth and wonder
( where those years have gone )
i hope you still feel small
when you stand by the ocean
"whenever one door closes , i hope one more opens"
promise me you 'll give faith a fighting chance

dance

( time is a wheel and constant motion always )
i hope you dance

walkin ' with my honey down by the water green
spring is in the air but we 're doin '
i 'm just a poor boy she 's the banker
nights are warm and sun is in the valley green
nights are warm and sun is in the valley
warm and sweet were kisses from my sally green gren
love made us warm and we really should n't tarry
love made us warm and we really should n't tarry
cause she 's only seventeen and not allow to marry
i went to the banker ask him for his daughter
i went to the banker ask him for his daughter
he flew into a rage and he said i could
the leaves 're fallin ' and where is my honey
the leaves 're fallin ' and where is my honey
curse on that banker and curse on his money gold
snow is fallin ' on the sun and valley gone
snow is fallin ' on the sun and valley i
they pull her body from the freeing water cold cold
they pull her body from the freeing water
there beneath the tree lay our baby daughter cold cold
diggin ' two graves down by the water green green
diggin ' two graves down by the water
one for my true love one for baby daughter green
in the world 's mighty gallery of pictures
hang the scenes that are painted from life
there 's pictures of love and of passion
and there 's pictures of peace and of strife
there hang pictures of youth and of beauty
"of old age , and the blushing young bride"
they all hang on the wall
but the saddest of all
are the pictures from life 's other side
just a picture from life 's other side
someone has fell by the way
a life has gone out with the tide
that might have been happy some day
there 's a poor old mother at home
she 's watching and waiting alone
just longin ' to hear
from a loved one so dear
it 's just a picture from life 's other side
the first scene is that of a gambler
who had lost all his money at play
and he draws his dead mother 's ring from his
that she wore long ago on her wedding day
"it 's his last earthly treasure , but he stakes"
and he bows his head that his shame that he
but when they lifted his head
they found he was dead
that 's just a picture from life 's other side
"now the last scene , is that by the river"
of a heart broken mother and babe
as the harbor lights shine and they shimmer
on an outcast whom no-one will save
and yet she was once a true woman
she was somebody 's darlin ' and pride
god help her she leaps
for there 's no-one to weep
it 's just a picture from lifes other side
the next was a scene of two brothers
whose pathways so diff'rent had led
one lived the life of a rich man
the other one begged for his bread
then one night they met on the highway
"`` your money or life '' , the thief cried"
and then with his knife - took his own brother
it 's just a picture from life 's other side
you think i 'm always making
something out of nothing
saying everything is ok
you 've always got an answer
before i ask the question
... whatever you say
now we can change the subject
pretend i never brought it up
some old story anyway
later we can work it out
but right now were talked out
.... yeah whatever you say
* choirs *
i know you can hear me
but i 'm not sure your listening
i hear what your saying
but still there something missing
whether i go whether i stay
right now depends on
whatever you say
you say yes you need me
i know you would n't leave me
and this should be enough
to make me stay
and even though i want to
i do n't hear i love you
.. in whatever you say
* choirs *
i know you can hear me
but i 'm not sure your listening
i hear what your saying
but still there something missing
whether i go whether i stay
right now depends on
whatever you say
oh whether i go whether i stay
right now depends on

tasted like an apple pie we were wishing and kissing
sho ' nuff messing me up
till i could n't tell the moonlight from the stars
i never felt so fine caught up in a good
and that apple pie moonshine well we were dancing around
her hands in the back pockets of my jeans the

and i never forget that first kiss
when a country boy got to hold a real princess
every time i reminisce
its sweeter than moonshine tasting like an apple pie

i come to the garden alone
while the dew is still on the roses
"and the voice i hear , falling on my ear"
the son of god discloses .
and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known .
he speaks and the sound of his voice
is so sweet the birds hush their singing
and the melody that he gave to me
within my heart is ringing .
and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known .
i 'd stay in the garden with him
'tho the night around me be falling
but he bids me go ; through the voice of
his voice to me is calling .
and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known ...
i 've been higher than the high sierra
lower than death valley must be
"i 've been right , mostly wrong"
"wrong about you , right about me"
"the way i feel , ca n't explain"
so much passion turned to pain
the sun still shines most of the time
did you know the sun shines when it rains
i 've been cussed and i 've been praised
and i 've been nothing these days
"but i 'll come back , time will see"
"if i 'm wrong about you , right about me"

folks back home think i 'm a star now when
they say their hometown girl made good and should go
mom wonders why i do n't drive back in that
truth is i do n't have a car and i
a pair of false eyelashes and a tube of cheap
a pair of worn-out high heel shoes and a dress
these are all of my possessions all i have to
and the record played in my hometown is my only
i 'm so glad that dad ca n't see me
singin ' in this dingy place on the wrong side
now i 'm glad that i ca n't see the
for i was blind and turned from him in this
a pair of false eyelashes ...
yes the record played in my hometown is my only
caught in the vice of heaven and earth
he turned his life into a cell
imprisoned by the doubts that hound us all
and the desires that we all know so well
his days he lost to promises
his nights he purged of dreams
and he would wake in the hours before sunrise
and dread the coming of the day
never thought a man could become so desperate
never thought a life could lose so much hope
to tear at the roots around you
as if in manacles or irons or ropes
they say he told his children that all he taught
and that love and pride and honesty
were to be gained at too high a cost
it 's been thirty summers that i 've spent with
and i expect thirty more to pass
he is blessed by life in so many ways
that i could never turn my back
but i need just one more reminder
of that man that he used to be
if he would just look deep into my eyes
"and say it 's in you my love , that"
there 's not much a man can do inside a
just take his mem'ry trips and fights the pain
and a word from home can mean so much to
it 's been years since that last letter came
not a day goes by that i do n't think
and my nights are filled with thoughts of sweet marie
and old friends i ran around with keep on running
but i just wonder if they ever think of me
i wonder if they know that i 'm still living
and still proud to be a part of uncle sam
i wonder if they think i died of hunger
in this rotten prison camp in vietnam
not a day goes by that i do n't think
and my nights are filled with thoughts of sweet marie
and i remember daddy sayin ' you 'll come back
and i just wonder if they ever think of me
oh i just wonder if they ever think of me

"i thought you knew , guess i assumed to much"
"i do n't know how , but now wheir so"
"and i never planned , to so miss understand"
"but what you needed , you never asked me to"

and you have n't heard
i thought you knew my heart was yours
and that we were so together
"that we , would always be"
"i do n't believe , you leavin ' me is"
i 'm not askin ' you to let me rush
"i 'm askin ' for one chance , not to"
so i can say and do all the things i
i thought you knew
"if there were no words , no way to speak"
i would still hear you
"if there were no tears , no way to feel"
i 'd still feel for you
and even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart until the end of
"you 're all i need , my love , my"
all of my life
i have been waiting for all you give to me
"you 've opened my eyes , and shown me how"
i 've dreamed of this a thousand times before
in my dreams i could n't love you more
i will give you my heart until the end of
you 're all i need my love my valentine
( la la la la la la la )
and even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart until the end of
cause all i need is you my valentine
oh the snow flakes fell in silence
over belleau wood that night
for a christmas truce had been declared
by both sides of the fight
as we laid there in our trenches
the silence broke in two
by a german soldier singing
a song that we all knew
though i did not know the language
the song was silent night
then i heard my buddy whisper
"`` all is calm , all is bright ''"
then the fear and doubt surrounded me
cause i die if i was wrong
but i stood up in my trench
and i began to sing along
then across the frozen battlefield
another 's voice joined in
until one by one each man became
a singer of the hymn
then i thought i was dreaming
for right there in my sight
stood the german soldier
neath the falling flakes of white
and he raised his hand and smiled at me
as if seemed to say
here 's hoping we both live to see
us find a better way
then the devils clock struck midnight
and the skies lit up again
and the battlefield where heaven stood
was blown to hell again
but for just one fleeting moment
the answer seemed so clear
heaven 's not beyond the clouds
its just beyond the fear
"no , heaven 's not beyond the clouds"
its for us to find it here
i never once in my life
met someone like you .
i donâ€™t know what
the word blue means as long as iâ€™m with you
"you fill me so completely ,"
through everything you do
"blue is not , a word at all as long"
"most of the time ,"
in my past
blue was all i knew .
"but now that were together ,"
oh how i love you .
"im so glad i found you ,"
you made my dreams come true .
blue is not a word at all as long as
"most of the time ,"
in my past
blue was all i knew
"but now that were together ,"

georgia georgia the whole day through
just an old sweet song keeps georgia on my mind
( georgia on my mind )
oh georgia georgia a song of you
comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines
other arms reach out to me and other eyes smile
still in peaceful dreams i see the road that road
leads back to you
ooh georgia oh georgia no peace i find
just an old sweet song keeps georgia on my mind
( georgia on my mind )
other arms reach out to me ...
yeah i say an old sweet song keeps georgia on
one foot strands before the crib
the other by the casket
a question formed upon stilled lips
is passed on but never asked
i guess i believe that there 's a point
to what we do
but i ask myself is there
something more besides you ?
two are born to cross
"their paths , their lives , their hearts"
if by chance one turns away
are they forever lost ?
i guess i believe that there 's a point
to what we do
but i ask myself is there
something more besides you ?
"this morning i awoke ,"
the bed warm where it once was cold
small blessings laid upon us
small mysteries slowly unfold
yet i still wonder is there a point
to what we do ?
'cause i kind of doubt
that there is something more besides you
although it 's hard to find the point
"to what we do ,"
do i dare believe that there is
something more besides you ?
you got me headed in a new direction
got no reason to turn around
ai n't got no looking back or second guessing
it 's time to find what love is really all
go the distance
let our hearts lead us on
all the way to forever tonight
ca n't resist it
the feelin 's way too strong
go the distance this time
the road to love is paved with shiftin ' gravel
we may find ourselves on shaky ground
and there ai n't no place that these two hearts
even when we 're miles apart together we are bound
go the distance
let our hearts lead us on
all the way to forever tonight
ca n't resist it
the feelin 's way too strong
go the distance this time
but if we lose our way we ca n't get
go the distance
let our hearts lead us on
all the way to forever tonight
ca n't resist it
the feelin 's way too strong
go the distance this time

"forever young , forever young"
may you stay forever young
i got a feelin ' called the blues
oh lord since my baby said goodbye
( hey lord ) i do n't know what i
all i do is sit and sigh
"oh lord , the last long day she said goodbye"
hey lord i thought i would cry
she 'll do me
she 'll do you
she 's got that kind of lovin '
and lord i love to hear her
when she calls me sweat daddy
such a beautiful dream
i hate to think it 's all over
i lost my heart it seems
i 've grown so used to you somehow
lord i 'm nobody 's sugar daddy now
i 'm lonesome
i got the lovesick blues
hey i 'm in love
i 'm in love with a beautiful gal
that 's whats the matter with me
hey i 'm in love
i 'm in love with a beautiful gal
but she do n't care about me
hey lord i tried and i tried
to keep her satisfied
but that gal would n't stay
and now that she is leavin '
this is all i can say
i 'm against the days
when the skies stay bummer-grey
"and the cake just tastes okay , okay"
well i guess i 'm anti-yuck
against the stuff that sucks
pulls the life out of your soul
and shuts it down
i 'm against the doc
letting good tomatoes rott
being someone that you 're not
when you 're not
well i guess i 'm anti-hate
cause that ai n't what it takes
it'ss love that makes
this crazy world go round
"i 'm for the sun , i 'm for the"
old dogs sleeping at your feet
i 'm for the girls with curls and curves
i 'm for questions
i 'm for freedom
celebrating every season
for the bees and the trees and the dirt
i 'm for the birds
i 'm for the birds
i 'm for the birds
i 'm against the notion
of drinking witchy potions
and causing big commotion
you know son
i guess i 'm anti-confrontation
i 'd rather have a conversation
about nothing in particular at all
i 'm against them feelings
the once that get revealing
slamming hearts right in the ceilings
you feel me
and i guess i 'm anti-tears
i 'd rather sip an ice cold beer
listen to some country music until dawn
"i 'm for the sun , i 'm for the"
old dogs sleeping at your feet
i 'm for the girls with curls and curves
i 'm for questions
i 'm for freedom
celebrating every season
for the bees and the trees and the dirt
i 'm for the birds
i 'm for feathers
i 'm for wings
i 'm for tweedle-deedle-dee-dee-dee
for what its worth
for what its worth
i 'm for the birds
i 'm for the birds
i 'm for the birds
i 'm for the birds
i 'm for the birds
i 'm for the birds
i 'm for the birds
tweedle-deedle-dee-dee-dee
tonight i 'm alone without you my dear
it seems there 's a longing for you still
all i have to do now is sit alone and
in our little cabin home on the hill
"oh , someone has taken you from me"
and left me here all alone
just to listen to the rain beat on my window
in our little cabin home on the hill
i hope you are happy tonight as you are
but in my heart there 's a longing for you
i just keep it there so i wo n't be
in our little cabin home on the hill
now when you have come to the end of the
and find there 's no more happiness for you
just let you thoughts turn back once more if you
to our little cabin home on the hill
thirty bucks would fill a tank up
and leave change for some cheap snuff
"we 'd be , six-deep in a '97 jeep wrangler"
"back then , we knew we were bad"
it did n't matter where the party was at
"mapco , the old railroad track"
we 'd get there slow and hope it all would
"spring break tattoo , you knew better"
like the man in the moon that age old sun-setter
makes the best shine and the world go 'round and
"so , let the good times roll and do n't"
"let your young grow old , these days around this"
you 'll think about 'em 'til the cows come home
"for now , forever"
"hmm , hmm ( hey )"
"i still remember three dollar hill , a slick spot"
"we 'd be , sittin ' stuck in the super"
waitin ' on a old timer by the name of
"for a , few bucks and some old crow ,"
hell on the gears but good for the soul
"lordy , lookin ' back at them years"
"you know i 'd stay in that hole , forever"
"spring break tattoo , you knew better"
like the man in the moon that age old sun-setter
makes the best shine and the world go 'round and
"so , let the good times roll and do n't"
"let your young grow old , these days around this"
you 'll think about 'em 'til the cows come home
"for now , forever ( hey , hey , woo"
"oh , do n't let your young grow old"
just let the good times roll
these days around this podunk town
you 'll think about 'em 'til the cows come home
"oh , do n't let your young grow old"
just let the good times roll
these days around this podunk town
you 'll think about 'em 'til the cows come home
"for now , forever"
"spring break tattoo , you knew better"
like the man in the moon that age old sun-setter
makes the best shine and the world go 'round and
"so , let the good times roll and do n't"
"let your young grow old , these days around this"
you 'll think about 'em 'til the cows come home
"for now , forever ( oh , yeah , woo"
"oh , you think about it"
you think about it
"ooh , yes you will ( hey )"
oh-oh
hmm-hmm
"take it home , boys"

the fire of the wine and the touch of a
but i fell in love and ruined all of your

when i beat on the door and i beg to

that good old boy standing out in the rain
with his nose on the windowpane

when a man comes over just to visit with you
and i 'm on the porch with a 2 by

"you can sound the alarm , wake the neighbors up"

what 'll you do about me

the fire of the wine and the touch of a
but i fell in love and baby here i am
