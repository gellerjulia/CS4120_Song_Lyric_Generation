well you asked me to tell you about her
since we have been friends for so long
well she 's really an outstanding woman
more precious than any i 've known
she 's soft she 's kind and she 's gentle
she likes to be loved tenderly
she 's the kind you wo n't ever get over
and she should belong to me
do n't leave her at night she 'll be frightened
she 's afraid when the darkness sets in
and blue is her favorite color
and she prefers home loving men
she likes roses on special occasion
champagne makes her laugh and feel free
she wants to be held when she 's lonely
and she should belong to me
she should be here with me in these two arms
happy like we used to be
she no longer needs me i 've run out of
oh she should belong to me
oh she should belong to me

this song 's about the night they spent protecting you
someone called us outlaws in some old magazine
and new york sent a posse down like i ai
do n't you think this outlaw bit 's done got
what started out to be a joke the law do
was it singing through my nose that got me busted
maybe this here outlaw bit 's done got out of
[ guitar ]
we were wrapped up in our music that 's why
the car pulls up the boys get out and the
they came boundin ' through the backdoor in the middle
they got me for possession for something that was gone
do n't you think this outlaw ...
do n't you think this outlaw bit 's done got
all alone at the end of the evening and the
i was thinkin ' about a woman who might have
you know i 've always been a dreamer spent my
and it 's so hard to change ca n't seem
but the dreams i 've seen lately
keep on turnin ' out and burnin ' out and
so put me on a highway and show me a
[ piano ]
you can spend all your time making money you can
if it all fell to pieces tomorrow would you still
and when you 're looking for more freedom when nobody
and you ca n't find the door well you ca
when there 's nothin ' to believe in
still you 're coming back you 're running back
you 're coming back for more
so put me on the highway and show me a
take it to the limit take it to the limit
well the road was hot and flat as a ruler
good hundred miles between me and medulla
that violet top was n't gettin ' no cooler
i stopped at a quickie sack
well i figured i 'd need about a sixth of
and one of those things so i would n't spill
i asked the girl if the beer was in the
she said
it 's a dry town
"no beer , no liquor for miles around"
i 'd give a nickel for a sip or two
to wash me down
outta this dry town
"so i turn right around , no hesitation"
cursed the law for ruinin ' the nation
waved goodbye to the boy at the station
but she would n't go in gear
he said it sounds like your transmission
"you need bob , but he 's gone fishin '"
"his day off , he gets a long way from"
cause
it 's a dry town
"no beer , no liquor for miles around"
i 'd give a nickel for a sip or two
to wash me down
outta this dry town
well if i call a friend you can get a
something strong from your local grocer
so i walked down til i got a little closer
to a place called happy jars
he said i keep something here for colds and fevers
down underneath where i usual leave her
just last night i felt a cold comin on
it 's a dry town
"no beer , no liquor for miles around"
i 'd give a nickel for a sip or two
to wash me down
outta this dry town

"you 've got this confidence , yeah it was obvious"
the way you walked in here
you look sensational and totally capable
of buying your own beer
but you should n't have to
you should n't have to
i hate to think about everything you 've done without
or how it 's been before
you 've ever walked home alone or sat and waited
or opened your own door
you should n't have to
you should n't have to
do you ever wonder when your dreams will come true
a girl like you can do anything
but anything you do n't wan na do
you should n't have to
you should n't have to
you ever long for a back rub
all alone in your bathtub
need your glass of wine topped off
"but you have to get out and dry off ,"
you should n't have to
you should n't have to
do you ever wonder when your dreams will come true
a girl like you can do anything
but anything you do n't wan na do
like wash your own car or bait your own hook
"get all made up , wonder how you look"
"make your own breakfast , make the first move"
feel like you ai n't being listened to
"kill your own spiders , change a flat tire"
"stoke your own fire , mow your own grass"
"pump your own gas , ever feel pain"
wish you had a ring on your hand
feel like anything less than the best-lookin ' thing this
have a dress you 'd love to wear but you
'cause there ai n't nobody there to help you zip
you should n't have to
you should n't have to
you should n't have to
when my little girl gets that sleep in her eyes
and she settles in with her head on my chest
why do i feel like my heart 's gon na
that i 'm willing to die for this angel at
"and why am i filled with unshakeable faith ,"
when i look at that child so fragile and sweet
"there 's something eternal i see in her face ,"
something much more than her mother and me .
maybe i 'm looking at the face of god .
makes me think i may be looking at the face
and he 's smiling back at me .
"why do i feel like the smallest of things ,"
when i try to count all the stars in the
when i see the world that we 're in at
why do i feel like it 'll all be all
i ca n't see the wind as it moves through
so how do i know that i know that i
that somebody out there is speaking to me ?
saying : `` i love you and you 're not
maybe i 'm looking at the face of god .
makes me think i may be looking at the face
and he 's smiling back at me .
"oh , i know that i know that i know"
somebody ’ s out there .
"when i look at the beauty around me ,"
and the love that surrounds me .
maybe i 'm looking at the face of god .
makes me think i may be looking at the face
and he 's smiling back at me .
maybe i 'm looking at the face of god .
and he 's smiling back at me .
that cold north wind is blowing grey eyes you know
the years are quickly going grey eyes you know
and the good life i promised you so long ago
is dead but for a dreaming grey eyes you know
we never had much money grey eyes you know
more rainy days than sunny grey eyes you know
and life has been a long hard road to hoe
but you stuck right by me smiling grey eyes you
hard times took the blue from your eyes
leaving them grey as the winter 's skies
we 've had our talk now i must walk away
leave you here beneath this mound of clay
and i feel so empty as i turn to go
for my heart lies there beside you grey eyes you
my heart lies there beside you grey eyes you know
"i like candy , i like cake , i like"
there 's nothin ' as sweet as my baby
"golden hair and big , blue eyes she could win"
there 's nothin ' as sweet as my baby
if i ever lose her i 'll lay me down
if sugar seems sweet then you ought to meet
my honey coated sweetie pie
"i like candy , i like cake , i like"
there 's nothin ' as sweet as my baby
"i like candy , i like cake , i like"
there 's nothin ' as sweet as my baby
i feel like a honey bee when she 's buzzing
there 's nothin ' as sweet as my baby
got pounds of candy kisses but i ca n't spare
"she 's sweeter than wine and brother , she 's"
and that 's the only thing that counts
"i like candy , i like cake , i like"
there 's nothin ' as sweet as my baby
well i first kissed you on a hollow log
down by the river they call the dog
we fell in love and we vowed that day
like the flow of the river our love wo n't
well we married that spring and we built a house
on the bank of the river where the rock juts
now the river ? still here but you 're long
you left me and the river here all alone
i got the dog river blues
i ? e walked holes in both my shoes
now i still got the river but i ai n't
i got the dog river blues
well the rain came down and the river rose up
filled up the cab on my pickup truck
it came in the house and down the hall
and washed your picture right off the wall
well my heart still yearns and the river still rolls
and i pray someday it 'll bring you home
so if you change your mind honey i 'll be
waiting on the banks of that olddog river
in the twilight glow i see her
blue eyes crying in the rain
when we kissed goodbye and parted
i knew we 'd never meet again
love is like a dying ember
only memories remain
through the ages i remember
blue eyes crying in the rain
someday when we meet up yonder
we 'll stroll hand in hand again
in a land that knows no parting
blue eyes crying in the rain
blue eyes crying in the rain
blue eyes crying in the rain
blue eyes crying in the rain
you tell me today that you 're leaving
but just think a while
i 'm sure that you must know
today might be the day that you walk away
"but you left me a long , long time ago"
today 's just the day that ends it all
except the usual mem'ries
that always lingers on
and today might be the day that you walk away
"but you left me a long , long time ago"
i stood with helpless hands
and watched me lose your love
a little more each day
then it was gone
and i kept wond'rin '
just how long until this day would come
how long could your pride keep hangin ' on .
so please do n't say you 're sorry
do n't say anything
do n't try to say why you must leave
just go
and today might be the day that you walk away
"but you left me a long , long time ago"
"you left me a long , long time ago"

wishing we were rockets bursting in the sky
talking about redemption and leaving things behind

as fierce as monday morning feeling washed away
"i orchestrated paradise , couldn ’ t make you stay"

these pictures and these photographs
let me know i ’ m doin ’ fine
i used to make you happy once upon a time
but the sun sank west on the mendocino county line
the two of us together felt nothin ’ but right
feeling near immortal every friday night

these pictures and these photographs

i used to make you happy once upon a time

tuesday night crowded bar
some guy lights a cheap cigar
bartender yells at him
so he walks out and you walk in
right through the cloud of smoke
catcalls and dirty jokes
scan the room a couple times
find a seat right next to mine
lonely eyes
"well , it sure looks like"
you just might
be looking for something
"for something , whoa"
look at me
and i think you 'll see
those lonely eyes
do n't have to be alone tonight
they analyze your glass of wine
roll away a pickup line
now and then they check your phone
catch mine and let 'em go
from the little bit i 've seen
they 're the perfect shade of green
next time they come my way
heaven do n't make 'em stay
do n't make me pay my tab
catch a cab
go home and kick myself to sleep tonight
gim me a sign
just a smile
"baby , i 'll be glad to lose myself deep"
lonely eyes
lonely eyes
sure looks like
you just might
be looking for something
"for something , whoa"
look at me
and i 'll think you 'll see
those lonely eyes
they do n't have to be alone tonight
"lonely eyes , you do n't have to be alone"
"now and then , here and there , i still"
"and sometimes my memory lets me hear your voice ,"
"but like the wind you travel in , you seem"
"at times , my mind is crystal clear"
and then i think of you
then the spin of the room i 'm in
brings you into view
love that once
held my mind completely in control
now makes it spin like tornado wind
as it comes and goes
"well , look who 's here"
i told myself that you 'd be coming soon
i hope that you can stay for a little while
it 's so lonesome in this room
and you look just the same today
do you still love me so ?
"what 's that you say , you ca n't stay"
you seem to come and go
at times my mind is crystal clear
and then i think of you
then the spin of the room i 'm in
brings you into view
love that once
held my mind completely in control
now makes it spin like tornado winds
as it comes and goes
i 'm going home to magic valley where hay turns
i 'm going home to magic valley leaving for my
now do n't you cry because i 'm leaving for
i 've led the life that 's not for grieving
for i hear my lord telling me put down that
you 'll reach your gold now follow me come on
for i hear my lord telling me ...
if i 'm not in love with you
"what is this i 'm going through , tonight"
and if my heart is lying then
what should i believe in
why do i go crazy
every time i think about you baby
why else do i want you like i do
if i 'm not in love with you
and if i do n't need your touch
"why do i miss you so much , tonight"
if it 's just infatuation then
why is my heart achin '
to hold you forever
give a part of me i thought i 'd never
give again to someone i could lose
if i 'm not in love with you
oh why in every fantasy
do i feel your arms embracing me
lovers lost in sweet desire
oh why in dreams do i surrender
like a little baby
someone help explain this feeling
someone tell me
if i 'm not in love with you
"what is this i 'm going through , tonight"
and if my heart is lying then
what i should believe in
why do i go crazy
every time i think about you baby
"why else do i want you like i , i"
if i 'm not in love with you
been wound up tighter than a banjo string
price of gas groceries and all those things
they sound little till you add 'em all up
then you really feel the crunch .
"man , i 've had enough ."
"i need to chill , give it a rest"
get down to the lake with a full ice chest
"and chill , and let a cold corona"
lift this world right off my shoulders
"climb in the water , steak on the grill"
i think its way past time for me to chill
just chill .
this morning 65 was a parking lot
bumper to bumper just start and stop
sometimes i think we 're like a bunch of rats
getting caught in our own traps
"well , i say to hell with that ."
i need to chill give it a rest
get down to the lake with a full ice chest
"and chill , and let a cold corona"
lift this world right off my shoulders
"climb in the water , steak on the grill"
i think its way past time for me to chill
just chill .
before we go to therapy and take another pill
"we just need to chill , give it a rest"
lay down in a hammock and take a deep breath
"and chill , it do n't cost a dime"
to reel in your troubles and just unwind
cork in the water and time to kill
you ca n't tell me this ai n't a great
just chill
"man , i need to chill ."
just chill .
i 've been wondering if i was more like water
"would i still find , a place to hide ?"
'cause i do n't want to stay here hidin '
"if i was more like water , i 'd surround"
would i cry for you ?
would i freeze over ?
would i slip through the cracks unnoticed ?
or crash into you ? crash into you
when i feel like a storm is on its way
"i know that i can take it , as long"
"your love like shelter from the rain , and that"
"i know that i can take it , as long"
"as long as i can face it , with you"
i can see so clearly standing on your shoulders
"it takes more than me , it takes you ,"
let the days turn into years as we grow older

"i 've been blinded , by my feelings"
self pity and sorrow was all i could see
tears i was crying
"kept me from seeing , i did n't love"
that man as much as he loved me
looking for excuses and other reasons
to keep myself in a constant doubt
after all my searching and undo hurting
i nearly lost the only good thing i ever found

"way down in columbus , georgia"

friends all turned their backs on me
go and leave me if you wish to
never let it cross your mind
if in your heart you love another
"leave me little darling , i do n't mind"
last night as i lay sleeping
i dreamt i held you in my arms
when i awoke i was mistaken
i was peering through the bars
many a night with you i 've rambled
many an hour with you i 've spent
thought i had your heart forever
now i find it 's only lent
his pulpit 's a corner
on 19th and main
his grip on the gospel
his one claim to fame
he hurls fire and brrimstone
at the cars passing by
and he offers salvation
for the savior on high
his khakis are tattered
and he aint bathed in weeks
his bout with the bottle
shows up on his cheeks
he looks like a scarecrow
a sight to behold
as he works for the shepherd
bringin lambs to the fold
he points to the bible
he holds in his hands
says im proof that the good lord
can save any man
"son , it aint what youre driving"
or the clothes that you wear
material possessions
wont matter up there
and someday in heaven
when the angels all sing
these rags that im wearin
will be fit for a king
hes fighting a fever
in spite of the chill
he pulls up his collar
and he speaks of gods will
his body is weakend
but his faith is sitll strong
for hes filled with conviction
for the mission he 's on
he knows soon in heaven
hell be homeless no more
as his work will soon echo
from that far distant shore
( chours )
and someday in heaven
when the angels all sing
these rags that i 'm wearin '
will be fit for a king
and someday in heaven
when the angels all sing
these rags that i 'm wearin '
i went to church last sunday
so i could sing and pray
but something quite unusual
happened on that day
now church it started right on time
just like it does without a doubt
and everything was all just fine
except when it came time to let us out
you know the preacher he kept preaching
he told us i have one more thing to say
children before you think of leaving
you better think about the judgment day
now everyone got nervous
because everyone was hungry too
and everyone was wondering
what was the next thing he would do
and the preacher he kept preaching
he said now i 'll remind you if i may
you all better pay attention
or i might decide to preach all day
and now everyone was getting so hungry
that the old ones started feeling ill
and the weak ones started passing out
and the young ones they could not sit still
and the preacher 's voice rose higher
so i snuck up on the balcony
and i crept into the choir
"and i begged them brothers , sisters , help me"
i said when i give you a signal
i said when i raise up my hand
wo n't you please join with me together
and praise the lord i have a plan
and the preacher he kept preaching
"long is the struggle , hard the fight"
"and i prayed , father please forgive me"
and then i stood up and with all my might
i sang
to the lord let praises be
it 's time for dinner now let 's go eat
we 've got some beans and some good cornbread
and i listened to what the preacher said
now it 's to the lord let praised be
it 's time for dinner now let 's go eat
yes and i did give a signal
yes and i raised up my hands
and then joined with me the choir
"yes every woman , child , and man"
they sang
to the lord let praised be
it 's time for dinner now let 's go eat
we 've got some beans and some good cornbread
and i 've listened to what the preacher said
now it 's to the lord let praised be
it 's time for dinner now let 's go eat
and the preacher he stopped preaching
and a hush the church did fill
and then a great white dove from up above
landed on the window sill
and the dove flew down beside him
and a fork appeared right in his hand
and with everybody watching
the preacher ate that bird right there and then
and now everyone got really nervous
and the preacher he did start to glow
and as we watched in disbelief
these were the words he spoke
he said now mama 's in the kitchen
and she 's been there all day
and i know she 's cooking something good
so let 's bow our heads and pray
and he sang
to the lord let praises be
it 's time for dinner now let 's go eat
we 've got some beans and some good cornbread
now listen to what the preacher said
he said to the lord let praised be
it 's time for dinner now let 's go eat
and the moral of this story
children it is plain but true
god knows if a preacher preaches long enough
even he 'll get hungry too
and he 'll sing
to the lord let praises be
it 's time for dinner now let 's go eat
we 've got some beans and some good cornbread
now listen to what the preacher said
he said to the lord let praised be
it 's time for dinner now let 's go eat

i 'll serve you ice cream and lemonade

to taos pueblo out in new mexico
one night my weary feet did go so i stopped
there 's a story in taos town that if a
when a fresh snow is on the ground a new
that night there came a snow in the mountains and
and i found a love that 's true i know
[ ac.guitar ]
that night in taos town it seemed love was all
and the pretty little girl i found a new love
from the first time we met i knew her love
and i know i 'll always love her too the
some night if it should snow there 's a place
there 's a legend that it 's true i know
"you told me you do n't love me , when"
"i stood there feelin ' lonely , then the tears"
"what else could i do , i 'd never felt"
so i cried an ol ' blue river in the
now i 'm up to my ears in tears
i 'm cryin ' night and day since you went
"the things you used to say honey , i no"
"the water 's cold and clear , i 'm drownin"
up to my ears in tears
well i found some old love letters you wrote me
but the words all ran together when the tears began
'cause you left that water runnin ' now it 's
if i ca n't wash away your memory guess i
'cause i 'm up to my ears in tears
i 'm cryin ' night and day since you went
"the things you used to say honey , i no"
"the water 's cold and clear , i 'm drownin"
up to my ears in tears
yeah i 'm up to my ears in tears
i 'm cryin ' night and day since you went
"the things you used to say honey , i no"
"that water 's cold and clear , i 'm drownin"
up to my ears in tears
yeah that water 's cold and clear
i 'm drownin ' for you dear
up to my ears in tears
every time that someone walks in
she turns around to see if it 's him
she checks her watch by the clock
i ca n't count the times he 's stood her
and one 's too much
how could anybody break a heart like hers
i ca n't stand to watch her hurt
i would gladly take his place
if she 'd just love me that way
he must not know what it 's worth
i do n't understand how anyone
could break a heart like hers
she keeps saying he 'll change someday
he was n't always this way
she things he hung the moon and stars
but all he 's done is string her along like
it do n't make sense
how could anybody break
a heart like hers
my daddy 's hands held three 's and two 's

and it took the schem of mama 's hands to
when times were bad and money 's slim she 'd
ands somehow she would make the food hold out another
now mama 's hands they tremble when she prays
but her voice is strong as she thanks god for
she looks at me and then she smiles she knows
that everything i am today i owe to mama 's
everything i am today i owe to mama 's hands

i seen the bright lights of memphis
and the commodore hotel
and it was there beneath a streetlamp
where i met a southern belle
well she took me to the river
where she cast her spell
and it was neath that memphis moonlight
she sang this song so well
if youll be my dixie chicken
ill be your tennesee lamb
and we can walk together
down in dixie land
down in dixie land
we hit all the hotspots
my money flowed like wine
till the lowdown southern whiskey
began to fog my mind
well i dont remember church bells
or the money i put down
on the white picket fence and boardwalk
at the house on the edge of town
now but boy do i remember
the strain of her refrain
and the nights we spent together
and the way she called my name
its been a year since she ran away
guess that guitar player sure could play
she always liked to sing along
he was always handy with a song
then one night in the lobby
of the commodore hotel
i by chance met a bartender
who said he knew her well
and as he handed me a drink
he bagan to hum a song
and all the boys there at the bar
began to sing along
merry christmas

i remember how your eyes used to light up
over promises that i made
but for the first time in my life
i know now how it feels to be afraid
i do n't know what i ’ d do if
this would sure be one lonely old town
for a man 's so busy going up in the
that he could n't see love coming down
love coming down
i remember all the times you told me
love 's all that matters to you
"and looking back now , wondering how i believed"
i had things more important to do
i can see how i must have looked to you
like some fool on a merry-go-round
and that a man 's so busy going up in
that he could n't see love going down
love going down
ca n't you see how everything i ’ ve learned
would just be wasted if you leave me
if you just give one more try
i swear i ’ ll always be here when you
if you can find it in your heart to forgive
i 'll try to keep both my feet on the
but if a man 's so busy going up in
that he could n't see love coming down
love coming down
this is a call to the colorblind
this is an iou
stranded behind a horizon line
try to be something true
"guess , i 'm grounded"
got my wings clipped
i 'm surrounded by
all this pavement
guess i 'll circle
while i 'm waiting
for my fuse to dry
someday i 'll fly
someday i 'll soar
someday i 'll be
so damn much more
cause i 'm bigger than my body
gives me credit for
why is it not the time ?
what is there more to learn ?
i 've shed this skin i 've been tripping in
and i 've never quite returned
"guess , i 'm grounded"
got my wings clipped
i 'm surrounded by
all this pavement
guess i 'll circle
while i 'm waiting
for my fuse to dry
cause i 'm bigger than my body now
maybe i 'll tangle in the power lines
and it might be over in a second 's time
but i 'll gladly go down in a flame
if the flame 's what it takes to remember my
"to remember my name , oh"
"yes , i 'm grounded"
got my wings clipped
i 'm surrounded by
all this pavement
guess i 'll circle
while i 'm waiting
for my fuse to dry
cause i 'm bigger than my body
bigger than my body
bigger than my body now
come and listen you fellows
so young and do fine
and seek not your fortune
"in the dark , dreary mines"
it will form as a habit
seep in your soul
'til the blood in your veins
runs as black as the coal
there 's many a man
that i 've known in my day
who lived just to labor
his whole life away
like a fiend with his dope
and a drunkard his wine
a man will have lust for
the lure of the mine
it 's dark as a dungeon
damp as the dew
the danger is double
and the pleasures are few
where the rain never falls
where the sun never shines
it 's dark as a dungeon
way down in the mine
i hope when i 'm gone
and the ages shall roll
my body will blacken
and turn into coal
then i 'll look out the door
of my heavenly home
and i 'll pity the miners
a-diggin ' my bones
it 's dark as a dungeon
damp as the dew
the danger is double
and the pleasures are few
where the rain never falls
where the sun never shines
it 's dark as a dungeon
way down in the mine
where the rain never falls
where the sun never shines
it 's dark as a dungeon
way down in the mine

the shadows move slowly
they climb up the walls
till the light hits the metal and glass
it shines through the dust
revealing the love
in an old black and white photograph
that was before
but it 's not anymore
'cause outside the frame
you 're getting on with your life
i wonder if i ever will
'cause inside my heart
i picture us frozen in time
just you and i standing still
now everything 's changed
outside the frame
the look in your eyes
your hand in mine
and we 're both holding on to a dream
i 'm still trapped in that moment
where the sun always shines
and i do n't ever want to be free
"no , i want to stay"
as the light fades away
'cause outside the frame
you 're getting on with your life
i wonder if i ever will
'cause inside my heart
i picture us frozen in time
just you and i standing still
now everything 's changed
outside the frame
outside the frame
where you 're getting on with your life
and i know that i never will
'cause inside my heart
i picture us frozen in time
just you and i standing still
now everything 's changed
outside the frame
i keep waiting for something to change
but the picture inside stays the same
i do n't want to hear it no more fussin
let 's let bygones be bygones let 's think about
i know i was wrong but i was just a
you were the only boy for me
ah but now i see the light and everything 's
pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa ...
i know i was wrong ...
you know i love you ooh you know i need
i do n't mean maybe you will always be my

"storybook endings , fairy tales coming true"
deep down inside we wan na believe they still do
"and a secret is heart , it 's our favorite"
let 's just admit we all want to make it
ever ever after
if we just do n't get it our own way
ever ever after
it may only be a wish away
"start a new fashion , wear your heart on your"
sometimes you reach what 's realest just by making believe
"unafraid , unashamed"
there is joy to be claimed in this world
you even might wind up being glad to be you
ever ever after
though the world will tell you it 's not smart
ever ever after
the world can be yours if you let your heart
believe in ever after
no wonder your heart feels it 's flying
your head feels it 's spinning
each happy ending 's a brand new beginning
"let yourself be enchanted , you just might break through"
to ever ever after
forever could even start today
ever ever after
maybe it 's just one wish away
your ever ever after
ever ever ever aftter

"i said , lord , take me downtown ,"
i 'm just lookin ' for some tush
"take me , take me to your darkest room"
close every window and bolt every door
the very first moment i heard your voice
i 'd be in darkness no more
take me to your most barren desert
a thousand miles from the nearest sea
the very moment i saw your smile
it would be like heaven to me
there 's not any mountain to rugged to climb
no desert too barren to cross
"darlin ' , if you would just show a sign"
"of love , i could bear with all loss"
take me to siberia
and the coldest weather of the winter time
and it would be just like spring in california
as long as i knew you were mine
"yes , it would be just like spring in california"
as long as i knew you were mine

bottled up inside

standing in a corner wearing concrete shoes
with my frozen smile
and my lighted fuse

i roll my heart out like a welcome mat
laugh when i feel like it
cry when i feel like it
that 's just how my life is

sitting here with you
you ask me why my tongus is tied
i 've tryed to make some since of all these
i 've been searching for the perfect words to say
they 've been said a thousand times
but they mean more today
'cause i 'm head over heels for you
and all of the things you do
the heavens and earth have moved
i 'm falling head over heels for you
so baby there it is i 've let it go
it 's funny how a feeling starts so small and
i had every line rehearsed i 'd say to you
then you looked into my eyes and they just slipped
'cause i 'm head over heels for you
and all of the things you do
the heavens and earth have moved
"i 'm falling , head over heels for you"
head over heels heart over mind you 've got me
i 've never dreamed in a million years i 'd
i 'm head over heels for you
and all of the things you do
the heavens and earth have moved
i 'm falling head over heels for you
head over heels for you
i 'm falling head over heels for you
oooo ohh i 'm falling
mmmm i 'm falling
how long will i love you
i do n't really know
i 'd like to think forever
is how far we could go
so let me paint a picture
of how it 's gon na be
the day you do n't mean everything to me
when a nickel 's worth a dollar
and gold ai n't worth a dime
when they build a ship on waters that will take
when the stars have all been counted
and i stop lovin ' you
honey they 'll be driving buicks to the moon
now you do n't have to worry
about what comes to pass
this old world may wear out
but my love 's gon na last
if they ever build that highway to the moon
i 'll just find something else to promise you
when a nickel 's worth a dollar
and gold ai n't worth a dime
when they build a ship on waters that will take
when the stars have all been counted
and i stop lovin ' you
honey they 'll be driving buicks to the moon
oh when the stars have all be counted
and i stop lovin ' you
honey they 'll be drivin ' buicks to the moon

your cheatin ' heart will make you weep
you 'll cry and cry and try to sleep
but sleep wo n't come the whole night through
your cheatin ' heart will tell on you
when tears come down like fallin ' rain
you 'll toss around and call my name
you 'll walk the floor the way that i do
your cheatin ' heart will tell on you
your cheatin ' heart will pine someday
and crave the love you threw away
the time will come when you 'll be blue
your cheatin ' heart will tell on you
when tears come down like fallin ' rain
you 'll toss around and call my name
you 'll walk the floor the way i do
your cheatin ' heart will tell on you

that wonderful someone
who makes the stars all shine
who fashioned the mountains
to reach to the sky
who brings each tomorrow
who hears every prayer
in sunshine or sorrow
if you call he 'll be there
that wonderful someone
who makes the flowers grow
who paints ev'ry sunset
with colors that glow
look all around you
and these wonders you 'll see
designed by that someone
for you and for me

who makes the flowers grow
who paints ev'ry sunset

though the miles are between us
i thought our love would strengthen
as it has so many times before
but something has happened
i can see it in your eyes
i can feel my world is crumblin '
and the blues are at my door
the last letter that you wrote was
on a blue piece of paper
that old feelin 's back
the clouds are movin ' in
the beginning of the end is near
i feel your love has faded into darkness
it seems i have no friend
i feel the blues movin ' in
oh it 's not the words you wrote that made
and broken-hearted
that 's put me in this sad shape i 'm
between the lines are mixed emotions
and there 's teardrops on the paper
you said that 's all i 'll write today
i 'll cose for now old friend
my state of mind is desperate
and this hole that i 'm sinkin ' in
gets deeper while i 'm diggin ' to get out
oh please give the right answer to the questions i
tell me you still love me
that would turn my world about
i guess i finally found what i do best
i always knew there was something i 'd be good
every man has something he does better than the rest
i still ca n't believe how much i miss you
and i guess i finally found what i do best
when it came to lovin ' oh you were something
i took all the love you gave and i surely
yes i lost in love but in sadness i 've
yes i guess i finally found what i do best
they say that every man has given talent
but if hurtin ' is a talent then i know
oh missing you just seems to come so natural
and i guess i finally found what i do best
oh if there 's something i wish i was n't
but i guess i deserve what i do best
as i turn out the light and bow my head
the answered prayer i 'm thankful for
is i made it through today
well her leavin ' took its toll on me
and it took a lot of faith
to find the strength to carry on
but i made it through today
oh i was guilty of takin ' her heart for
lettin ' love slip through my hands
'til i was empty-handed
and now i know how much i have and i
'cause i 've been given a second chance
and i intend to use it
i 'm not tryin ' to change the world
i 'm just tryin ' to find my way
and i still stumble now and then
but i made it through today
whoa i was guilty of takin ' this life for
lettin ' time slip through my hands
'til i was empty-handed
now i know how much i have and i ai
'cause i 've been given a second chance
and i intend to use it
as i turn out the light and bow my head
the answered prayer i 'm thankful for
is i made it through today
mmm-mmm i made it through today
mmm-mmm i made it through today

we always wanted a big two story house
back when we lived in that little two room shack
we wanted fame and fortune
and we 'd live life the way the rich folks
"we knew some how we 'd make it , together"
with dreams and hopes of things to come
we worked and never stopped
not much time for you and me
we had to reach the top
we bought that big two story house
and soon became the envy of the town
with all our work behind us
we 'd finally settled down
now we live ( yes we live ) in a
"whoa , what splendor"
but there 's no love about
i 've got my story
"and i 've got mine , too"
"how sad it is , we now live , in"
the house is filled with rare antiques
there 's marble on the floor
beauty all around us
like we 've never seen before
there 's chandeliers in every room
imported silks and satin all about
we filled the house with everything
but somehow left love out
now we live ( yes we live ) in a
oh what splendor
but there 's no love about
i 've got my story
"and i 've got mine , too"
"how sad it is , we now live , in"
the bright lights of the city are a pretty site
perhaps they 're extra pretty to a country girl like
temptation waits at every turn and it wo n't let
so mama when you pray tonight
say a special prayer for me
i miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding
the good-night kisses i get now are cruel and so
so mama when you pray tonight
and while you 're on your knees
mama say a special prayer for me
the nights get cold and lonely
when you 're faraway from home
and lonely makes it easy for a good girl to
evil eyes search through the night for lonely girls like
so mama when you pray tonight
say a special prayer for me
i miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding
these good-night kisses i get now are cruel and so
so mama when you pray tonight
and while you 're on your knees
mama say a special prayer for me

the freedom train is rolling down two hundred years of
two hundred years of glory never to turn back
the train is called america your ticket is a dream
that left the torture of freedom for all the world
she left the station in lexington in 1776
and rode to philadelphia where the liberty bell was fixed
george washington was the engineer john adams shovelled coal
and franklin punched the tickets tom jefferson added soul
all aboard america here comes the freedon train
she rode to new orleans the battle of 1812
with old hickory at the throttle she drove the british
the freedom train 's a fine train the toppest of
her whistle blows for the liberty with a mighty head
wheels of fortune sweaty pittsburg rolled across the mississipp '
from texas to misoury to one real exciting trip
then bang of track was broken smashed by a cannonball
that blew in great divided will the nation stand or
all aboard america here comes the freedon train
will annistage stepped into the cab and the wheels began
freedom train must never stop republic never fall
to the bloody fields of gettysburg the tear show in
she drove the train with fury the freedom train survive
again the train rode westward to california shores
to the deserts and prairies even stronger than before
from atlantic to pacific she drove the rail with pride
she travelled a track to glory with the good lord
all aboard america here comes the freedon train
there 's much more to this story like wilson and
they left the train to truman who stoked it mighty
then old dwight d eisenhower or lbj we sing
two brothers known as kennedy and martin luther king
and still the train rolls forward over history 's rugged
straightin ' by the journey and the land beneath her
and you and i roll along and stroke the freedom
for we stand to all americans hold old honor ca
all aboard america here comes the freedon train
i 've seen the south of france
i 've seen the sunset dance
over sunset avenue
i 've seen the rolling stones
got real high on rock n roll
seen a lot of dreams come true
but ai n't no moment like when i 'm holding
ai n't no moment like when i 'm holding onto
baby you 're above the years
i 've been moved to tears
by the wonders of this old world
one of god 's mysteries
did n't ever fail to get to me
is the moment when i 'm holdin onto you
ai n't no moment like when i 'm holding onto
i 've seen a newborn child
puts stars in her mamas eyes
and i pray to the man in the moon
i got drunk with the highway men
felt the burn of the desert wind
seen some promise and i do 's
ai n't no moment like when i 'm holding onto
ai n't no moment like when i 'm holding onto
baby you 're above the years
i 've been moved to tears
by the wonders of this old world
one of god 's mysteries
it never fails to get to me
is the moment when i 'm holding onto you
ai n't no moment like when i 'm holding onto
baby we just rolled in
it 's cold here in michigan
got a sold-out show tonight
pretty soon we 'll hit the stage
i 'll feel the lights hit my face
we 'll see some magic in the room
ai n't no moment like when i 'm holding onto
ai n't no moment like when i 'm holding onto
no no no no
ai n't no moment like when i 'm holding onto
ai n't no moment like when i 'm holding onto
i 'm waitin ' on the sun to set
'cause yesterday ai n't over yet
i started smoking cigarettes
"there 's nothing else to do , i guess"
dusty roads ai n't made for walking
spinning tires ai n't made for stoppin '
i 'm giving up on love
'cause love 's given up on me
i gave it everything i had
and everything i got was bad
life ai n't hard but it 's too long
to live it like some country song
trade the truth in for a lie
cheating really ai n't a crime
i 'm giving up on love
'cause love 's given up on me
forget you high society
i 'm soakin ' it in kerosene
light 'em up and watch them burn
teach them what they need to learn ha !
dirty hands ai n't made for shakin '
ai n't a rule that ai n't worth breakin '
well i 'm giving up on love
'cause love 's given up on me
"now , i do n't hate the one who left"
you ca n't hate someone who 's dead
he 's out there holding on to someone
i 'm holding up my smoking gun
i 'll find somewhere to lay my blame
the day she changes her last name
well i 'm giving up on love
'cause love 's given up on me
well i 'm giving up on love
"hey , love 's given up on me"
there 's a fork in the road
on my way home
"temptation waits : wine , women , and song"
lord my will breaks
where that road bends
and tonight i took a turn for the worse again
left was home
right was wrong
and you can bet by now she knows which road
it 's a road i know like the back of
but tonight i took a turn for the worse again
my old truck
pulls a little to the right
seems to get a lot worse on friday night
things are bad at home
lord i 'm sick of work
so tonight i took a turn for the worse
january 's always bitter
"but lord , this one beats all"
the wind ai n't quit for weeks now
and the drifts are ten feet tall
i been all night drivin ' heifers
closer in to lower ground
then i spent the mornin ' thinkin '
'bout the ones the wolves pulled down .
charlie barton and his family
stopped today to say goodbye
he said the bank was takin ' over
the last few years were just too dry
and i promised that i 'd visit
when they found a place in town
then i spent a long time thinkin '
'bout the ones the wolves pull down .
"lord , please shine a light of hope"
on those of us who fall behind
and when we stumble in the snow
could you help us up while there 's still time
"well , i do n't mean to be complainin '"
you 've always seen mme through
and i know you got your reasons
for each and every thing you do
but tonight outside my window
"there 's a lonesome , mournful sound"
and i just ca n't keep from thinkin '
'bout the ones the wolves pull down .
"oh lord , keep me from bein '"
the one the wolves pull down
you 're just as good as gone
you 've been leaving for so long
"ai n't been yours , you ai n't been mine"
it 's been over for quite some time
so go ahead walk on out the door
you do n't love me anymore
we know that this just ca n't drag on
it 's too bad you 're just as good as
i see that you 've made up your mind
and goodbye 's for good this time
no need to fight no need to fuss
it 's too late for the two of us
i feel so bad i feel so blue
in my heart i know that we are through
i 'm losing you and oh lonely won
"it 's obvious , you 're just as good as"
you 're just as good as gone
you 've been leaving for so long
"ai n't been yours , you ai n't been mine"
it 's been over for quite some time
so go ahead walk on out the door
you do n't love me anymore
we know that this just ca n't drag on
it 's too bad you 're just as good as
you 're just as good as gone
you 've been leaving for so long
"ai n't been yours , you ai n't been mine"
it 's been over for quite some time
so go ahead walk on out the door
you do n't love me anymore
we know that this just ca n't drag on
it 's too bad you 're just as good as
it 's so sad you 're just as good as
it 's you that
i run to
whenever i need to
"darling , you console me"
when trouble surrounds me
when bad times have found me
just reach out your arms and hold me

darling please take me
in your arms of safety
reach out you arms
and hold me

when life is demanding
when i need understanding
reach out
reach out and hold me
hold me
hold me
sad songs sound sadder
on an old gibson
it only gets better
played a thousand times
like an old georgia pine ca n't pick up and
"home is still home , no matter which road you"
you ca n't put reins on a wild palomino
you wo n't see an old cowboy cry
long as god 's still in church
and hard work still works
and this collar on my shirt 's still blue
i 'll never stop lovin ' you
a broke heart keeps breaking
sitting at a bar
whiskey 's a band-aid
it just leaves more scars
like an old georgia pine ca n't pick up and
"home is still home , no matter which road you"
you ca n't put reins on a wild palomino
you wo n't make a rolling stone stay
long as god 's still at church
and hard work still works
and that collar on my shirt 's still blue
i 'll never stop lovin ' you
i ca n't change your mind
ca n't change the weather
if you need some time to run free
i made you a promise
for worse or for better
even though missing you 's killin ' me
you ca n't put reins on a wild palomino
and you wo n't see this old cowboy cry
long as god 's still in church
and hard work still works
and that collar on my shirt 's still blue
i 'll never stop lovin ' you
i 'll never stop lovin ' you
"i 've had good luck , and bad luck"
"and no luck , it 's true"
but i always get lucky with you
"i 've been turned on , and turned down"
when the bars close at two
but i always get lucky with you
i 've had two strikes against me
most all of the time
and when it 's down to just a phone call
i 'm minus a dime
"i 've had good days , and bad days"
but when the day is through
i always get lucky with you
"oh , i always get lucky with you"
memories and drinks do n't mix too well .
jukebox records do n't play those wedding bells .
lookin ' at the world through the bottom of a
all i see is a man who 's fading fast
tonight i need that woman again .
what i 'd give for my baby to just walk
sit down beside me and say : `` it 's
`` take me home and make sweet love to me
"but here i am again , mixin ' misery and"
sittin ' with all my friends and talkin ' to
i look like i 'm havin ' a good time
that this honky tonk heaven really makes ya ' feel
"i light a lonely woman 's cigarette ,"
we both start talkin ' 'bout what we want to
her life story and mine are the same .
we both lost someone and only have ourselves to blame
"but here i am again , mixin ' misery and"
sittin ' with all my friends and talkin ' to
i look like i 'm havin ' a good time
that this honky tonk heaven really makes ya ' feel
joy to the world ! the lord has come :
let earth receive her king .
"let every heart prepare him room ,"
"and heaven and nature sing , and heaven and nature"
and heaven and heaven and nature sing .
joy to the world ! the savior reigns :
"let men their songs employ ,"
"while fields and floods , rocks , hills , and"
"repeat the sounding joy , repeat the sounding joy ,"
"repeat , repeat the sounding joy ."
"he rules the world with truth and grace ,"
and makes the nations prove
the glories of his righteousness
"and wonders of his love , and wonders of his"
"and wonders , wonders of his love ."

and glorious morn

"oh , night divine"
"oh , night"
when christ was born
"oh , night divine"
oh night
"oh , holy night"

"just give him up , get him out of your"
promise me that once and for all
you 're gon na tell him that it 's over
"the very next time he calls , ai n't you"
dump the dude
you know he 's got a rotten attitude
he always leaves you in a cryin ' mood
"take my advice , find somebody nice"
listen to what i 'm telling you
go on and dump the dude
"girl , i know you may think this is none"
but the fact that we 're friends i believe that
i care about you but i ai n't preachin '
i think you should dump the dude
i do n't know why you 'd want to settle
when you could have so much more
you know that you deserve only the best
so what are you waiting for ?
go on and dump the dude
you know he 's got a rotten attitude
he always leaves you in a cryin ' mood
"take my advice , do n't you think twice"
find yourself somebody nice
go on and dump the dude
i 've got a never ending love for you
"from now on , that 's all i want to"
from the first time we met i knew
i 'd have a never ending love for you
after all this time of being alone
we can love one another
feel for each other
from now on
feel so good i can hardly stand it
"i live for the phone , i die for the"
i took your picture right off the nail
and put it right by my bed
so i could see you instead
of the darkness of night
i hold conversations with you in my mind
they only tighten the knot deep inside
and teh aching wo n't end
'til i hold you again
if i only survive
why did you have to go
why am i missing you so
one heartbeat at a time
i 'm going out of my mind
"missing you , missing you"
"i started a letter , i stared at your name"
there was n't a line that did n't echo my
there was no sound at all
but the slow lonely fall
of an unspoken tear
why did you have to go
why am i missing you so
one heartbeat at a time
i 'm going out of my mind
"missing you , missing you"
life may take us in different directions
"but i always end up deeper , deeper in my"
why did you have to go
why am i missing you so
one heartbeat at a time
i 'm going out of my mind
"missing you , missing you"
he would know

in my mind i 've made love to you often
cause there 's someone at home that 's countin '
and if i did i 'm sure that he would
yes he would know yes he could tell
for he has loved me long enough to know me
and if i lie he sees it in my eyes
but i must admit you 're someone very special and
making love to you could be so easy but if
yes he would know ...
my conscience just wo n't let me make love to
i know it would be sweet but i just ca
when i go home to him i must be able
cause he would know ...

"and no luck , it 's true"
but i always get lucky with you
"i 've been turned on , and turned down"
when the bars close at two
but i always get lucky with you
i 've had two strikes against me

i 'm minus a dime

but when the day is through
i always get lucky with you

it ticks just like a timex
it never lets up on you
who said life was easy
the job is never through
it 'll run us 'til we 're ragged
it 'll harden our hearts
and love could use a day of rest
before we both start falling apart
i pray that it 's raining on sunday
stormin ' like crazy
we 'll hide under the covers all afternoon
baby whatever comes monday
can take care of itself
'cause we 've got better things that we can do
when it 's raining on sunday
your love is like religion
a cross in mexico
and your kiss is like the innocence
of a prayer nailed to a door
oh surrender is much sweeter
when we both let it go
let the water wash our bodies clean
and love wash our souls
and pray that it 's raining on sunday
stormin ' like crazy
and we 'll hide under the covers all afternoon
and baby whatever comes monday
can take care of itself

how long has it taken me to find you ?
"500 years , 500 thousand miles"
it don ’ t matter now
love ’ s always on time
meet me underneath the oklahoma sky
"lightening flashed , everything went silent"
a feather could have knocked me to the floor
missing piece was found
i was finally alive
meet me underneath the oklahoma sky
with the speed of sound
i ’ m homeward bound
mmmhmmm
all our sorrows swept away forever
each and every tear washed out to sea
there ain ’ t no goodbye with your hand in
meet me underneath the oklahoma sky
oklahoma sky
lately you leave me in a cold state of mind
your goodbyes are never on time
the blues just keep coming and drying out your eyes
"do n't you think i feel it , too ?"
"a slow train , a cold rain , i 'm"
the lights just are n't shining on me
"to live it again , i 'd believe in a"
"do n't you think i feel it , too ?"
"in a world of my own , where the ground"
"and the lights , they shine only from the sky"
"like you , like a fool , i 'm lost"
"and do n't you think i feel it , too"

there 's a mountain dew can with lipstick on it
rollin ' round his truck bed .
"he just leaves it back there ,"
one of the things he still has left of her
when he drives into the late day sun
you can see a set of footprints .
"he ai n't going to clean that windshield ,"
he 'd rather just live with the hurt .
he 's holdin ' on to the wheel
to the way she made him feel .
"to the shifter , to the pictures ."
every precious moment with her .
like the left behind colors in the sky
when the sun is gone .
he 's holdin ' on .
"oh , he 's holdin ' on ."
there 's that voicemail on his cell phone
he do n't dare erase .
"she ended with i love you ,"
and he saves it just in case
it might still be true .
no he ai n't through .
to the past
to the last time he held her
the breath on his neck .
the three words she said .
oh oh oh
he 's holdin ' on to the wheel
to the way she made him feel .
"to the shifter , to the pictures ."
every precious moment with her .
he 's holdin ' on
"yeah , he 's holdin ' on"
he 's holdin ' on
he 's holdin on
"she said , `` please do n't let me go"
"i said , `` i got ta let you go"
and love just laughed
that 's all that i remember
it was a bitter cold december
and love just laughed
love is still laughing
but you ca n't go back
what 's done is done
"yeah , that 's a fact"
but it was fun in a strange kind of way
we can look back and smile and say
`` whatever happened brought us down to the day ''
that love just laughed
and then love cried
"i said , `` where are you going ? ``"
we 're just getting started
and love just laughed
we were meant forever
but that 's turned into never
and love just laughed
love is still laughing
but you ca n't go back
what 's done is done
and that 's a fact
but it was fun in a strange kind of way
we can look back and smile and say
`` whatever happened brought us down to the day ''
love just laughed

let me be all that i should be to the
i 'm her world and she revolves around me
juest being close to me makes her love grow
each night she thanks god ofr the day she found
"why , when she came home this morning , she"
and there 's roses blooming in the arctic circle
icebergs in the gulf of mexico
and there 's not one star in heaven
or a sunrise every morning
i 'd believe it if she tole me so
i know people say she has a lover
reffering to this guy she 's come to know
"well , they 're just friends ,"
and she loves him like a brother
"nd she 's never even kissed him , she told"
and there 's roses blooming in the arctic circle
icebergs in the gulf of mexico
and there 's not one star in heaven
and 8 do n't follow 7
i 'd believe her if she told me so
"well , it wo n't be long now"
til that 'ol sun goes down
and darkness helps me hide my shameful tears .
my wife works all night long
for a man who 's halfway gone
she 's the barmaid in the honky-tonk downstairs .
it 's a shame she wears the name
of a man who 's locked and chained
to a bottle that 's destroyin ' all hopes and
to the men with hungry eyes
she works and hides her pride
she 's the barmaid in the honky-tonk downstairs .
"one , two , three , go"
"hmm , now lately i 've been livin ' in"
ever since you left all the colors just drained out
and i 've been goin ' through the motions

"i keep thinking 'bout that summer , south daytona beach"
"we never left the bed , no , we never"
and i 've been lookin ' back and thinking 'bout
"the way we were , we were reckless , so"
"when i was with you , baby , i was"
"yeah , we were sky high , there was nothing"
"when i was with you , grabbin ' that live"
where we were johnny and june in a ring of

are you still breakin ' all the hearts of all

"hmm , but even with all that , girl ,"
"for one more sleepless night , tangled up between your"

funny a woman can come on so wild and free
yet insist i do n't watch her undresses or watch
and stand by the bed and shiver as if she
just to lie down beside me and touch me as
one night of love do n't make up for six
i 'd rather have one than none lord i 'm
though sometimes it seems she ai n't worth the trouble
she can be worth the world if somehow you can
right or wrong a woman can own any man
she can take him inside her and hold his soul
then leave him as weary and weak as a newborn
fighting to get his first breath and open his eyes
one night of love ...

not even the blues
i 'm just a bummin ' around
and whenever worries
starts to botherin ' me

from a shack by a mountain stream
to a room in new orleans
so far from my blue ridge mountain home
the men i meet ai n't warm and friendly
like the one in old virginie
oh they ai n't real like my blue ridge mountain
i was just a little past eighteen
when i came to new orleans
i 'd never been beyond my home state line
there was a boy who loved me dearly
but i broke his heart severely
when i left my blue ridge mountain boy
life was dull in my hometown
lights were out when the sun went down
and i thought that city life was more my style
but nights get lonely away from home
and it 's easy to go wrong
the men ai n't kind like my blue ridge mountain
new orleans held things in store
things i 'd never bargained for
and every night a different man knocks on my door
but late at night when all is still
i can hear a whippoorwill
as i cry for my blue ridge mountain boy
oh but i can never go back home
since the boy i love is gone
he grew tired of waiting for me to return
they say he married last october
but i never will get over
oh the sweet love of my blue ridge mountain boy
blue ridge mountain boy
now blue ai n't the word for the way that
and the storm 's brewing in this heart of mine
this ai n't no crazy dream i know that it
you 're someone else 's love now you 're not
crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
while my yearning heart keeps saying you 're not mine
my troubled mind knows soon to another you 'll be
but for now i 'm just lonesome all the time
[ steel ]
so take all the treasured dreams i had for you
and take all the love i thought was mine
someday these crazy arms may hold somebody new
but for i 'm just lonesome all the time
crazy arms that reach ...
but for now i 'm just lonesome all the time
she got that 'hey y'all ' little southern draw
that she got from her mama
likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
she likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on
loves the rain on a tin roof when it 's
does n't matter what we 're listening to
spinning her around the living room
and i fall apart every time
she puts that beat in my chest
"pounds like a drum , shakes me like thunder"
"taking my hand , pulling me up when i 'm"
my dreams come alive when i wake up
and look in her eyes
she brings me back to life
"yes , she does"
she 's got her feet on the dash
"hair blowing back , hand out the window"
making up half the words that she 's singing
and she takes an hour to pick a movie out
five minutes in and she 's passing out
and i would n't dare wake her up when she
i 'd stay there forever if i could
doing nothing never felt so good
andi wish that i could stop time
she puts that beat in my chest
"pounds like a drum , shakes me like thunder"
"taking my hand , pulling me up when i 'm"
my dreams come alive when i wake up and look
"she brings me back to life , oh yes she"
and i do n't wan na think about where i
she puts that beat in my chest
"pounds like a drum , shakes me like thunder"
"taking my hand , pulling me up when i 'm"
my dreams come alive when i wake up
"and look in her eyes , woah"
"yeah , my dreams come alive when i wake up"
and look in her eyes
she brings me back to life
oh she does
back to life
been forever since i 've been gone
have n't held you in so long
miss you more than words can say
guess we 've got a little off track
but love knows a way back
through the storms and pouring rain
got my hands on the wheel and i 'm flying
heart beat loud as the thunder rolls
lightnin ' on the stampede of lightnin ' roll
i 'm bringing back the sunshine
bringing back the sunshine
"baby , it 's about time , oh oh oh"
"every moment , every sweet kiss"
all the loving that we both missed
it 's okay to let 'em go
yesterday 's all forgotten
and today we start rocking
somewhere underneath the rainbow
got my hands on the wheel and i 'm flying
heart beat loud as the thunder rolls
lightnin ' on the stampede of lightnin ' roll
i 'm bringing back the sunshine
bringing back the sunshine
"baby , it 's about time , oh oh oh"
"oh yeah , bringing back , ooh"
"ooh , bringing back the sunshine"
"baby , it 's about time , oh oh oh"
bringing back the sunshine
"baby , it 's about time , oh oh oh"
"bringing back , bringing back"
"oh , i 'm bringing back the sunshine"
"baby , it 's about time , oh oh oh"
"bringing back , ooh yeah"
the night never looked as dark as this
when the world slipped through you fingertips
"i held you close , the tears pouring down"
with thought of him spinning around
a spark of life like the wind to a flame
who can stand and who 's to blame
who are we when we fail to cope
in the bad times is where we find our hope
we can not answer and we 'll never know
what is the basic question grows and grows
"it 's a lifelong mystery , buried in the sand"
it 's all a part of god 's plan
so hold me tight through this lullabye
there 's always tomorrow and the answer is life
who are we when we fail to cope
in the bad times is where we find our hope
we can not answer and we 'll never know
what is the basic question grows and grows
"it 's a lifelong mystery , buried in the sand"
it 's all a part of god 's plan
they say a woman 's a fool for weeping
a fool to break her own heart
but i ca n't hold the secret i 'm keeping
i 'm breaking apart
ca n't seem to mind my own business
whatever i try turns out wrong
i seem like my own false witness
and i ca n't go on
"i cover my ears , i close my eyes"
still hear your voice and it 's telling me lies
telling me lies
you told me you needed my company
and i believed in your flattering ways
you told me you needed me forever
nearly gave you the rest of my days
should 've seen you for what you are
should never have come back for more
should 've locked up all my silver
brought the key right to your door
you do n't know what a chance is
until you have to seize one
you do n't know what a man is
until you have to please one
do n't put your life in the hands of a
with a face for every season
do n't waste your time in the arms of a
who 's no stranger to treason

walking in a winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
then pretend that he is parson brown
he 'll say : are you married ?
we 'll say : no man
but you can do the job
when you 're in town
"later on , we 'll conspire"
as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid
the plans that we 've made
walking in a winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
and pretend that he 's a circus clown
we 'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
until the other kids knock him down
"when it snows , ai n't it thrilling"
though your nose gets a chilling
"we 'll frolic and play , the eskimo way"
walking in a winter wonderland
walking in a winter wonderland
walking in a winter wonderland
if she brings you happiness
then i wish you both the best
it 's your happiness that matters most of all
but if she ever breaks your heart
if the teardrops ever start
i 'll be there before the next teardrop falls
though it hurts to let you go
darling i want you to know
i 'll run to you if ever you should call
and if i should ever hear
that she 's made you shed a tear

and i 'll be there
before the next teardrop falls

para borrar cada lagrima que hayas llorado
if he ever leaves you blue
just remember i love you
and i 'll be there
before the next teardrop falls
"i 'll be there , i 'll be there"
before the next teardrop falls

i once stood in the darkness i could n't see
backed up against the wall i built around my life
i 'd run out of reasons to ever love again
but somehow you found a door and you came waltzing
"walls can fall , storms can end"
"skys can clear , hearts can mend"
all it took was your sweet love to rise above
"you can build 'em strong and tall , but walls"
here we stand together with stones enough to build

o soul are you weary and troubled ?
no light in the darkness you see ?
"there 's light for a look at the saviour ,"
and life more abundant and free :
"turn you eyes upon jesus ,"

and the things of earth will grow strangely dim
in the light of his glory and grace .
through death into life everlasting

for more than conqu'rors we are !
his word shall not fail you he promised ;
believe him and all will be well .

"writers hank cochran , dean dillon"
what would your memories do
if they didnâ€™t have my mind to run through
if they didnâ€™t have my heart to break into

if one morning your memories woke up to find mine
would they go as crazy without me
as i have without you
would they last as long
what would your memories do
if someday they found the door to my mind
had been locked from inside by my heart
what would they do if they couldnâ€™t use you any

in your loveless mansion on the hill

the trees stand so silent and still
i know you 're alone with your pride dear

"i was standing by my window ,"
on one cold and cloudy day
when i saw that hearse come rolling
for to carry my mother away
will the circle be unbroken
"by and by , lord , by and by"
there 's a better home a-waiting
"in the sky , lord , in the sky"
i said to that undertaker
undertaker please drive slow
for this lady you are carrying
"lord , i hate to see here go"
will the circle be unbroken
"by and by , lord , by and by"
there 's a better home a-waiting
"in the sky , lord , in the sky"
"oh , i followed close behind her"
tried to hold up and be brave
but i could not hide my sorrow
when they laid her in the grave
will the circle be unbroken
"by and by , lord , by and by"
there 's a better home a-waiting
"in the sky , lord , in the sky"
"i went back home , my home was lonesome"
"missed my mother , she was gone"

what a home so sad and lone
will the circle be unbroken
"by and by , lord , by and by"
there 's a better home a-waiting
"in the sky , lord , in the sky"
we sang the songs of childhood
hymns of faith that made us strong
ones that mother maybelle taught us
hear the angels sing along

and i were beside you
would you gently smile dear
and whisper my name
and would you remember
the way that i held you
and would you want me
to hold you again
time reaches to you
just like a willow
that bends to the water
and clings to the shore
and there was a time dear
that once you did love me
and there was a time
you loved me no more

light on your pillow
the way you lie sleeping
is it like before
for there was a time dear

he tells me over and over that he loves me
he gives me love that i never got from you
"he loves me too , his love is true"
why ca n't he be you
he never fails to call and tell me i 'm
and i 'm lucky to have such a guy ;
and he does all the things that you would never
"he loves me , too , his love is true"
why ca n't he be you

angel flying too close to the ground

and your fever down
i knew someday that you would fly away
for love 's the greatest healer to be found

i will still remember
angel flying too close to the ground
"fly on , fly on past the speed of sound"
i 'd rather see you up
than see you down

i will still remember
angel flying too close to the ground

when you 've strayed from the fold
and there 's trouble in your soul
ca n't you hear the blessed saviour callin ' you
when your soul is lost in sin
and you 're at your journey 's end
ca n't you hear the blessed saviour callin ' you
you may not know me now
but i have been around
you 'll never see my name on any pages
i 'm just the common man
the fool who understands
the pain you go through
when life takes you under
"so , sing for the common man"
a song for the common man
he paid for the song with the sweat of his
"he will survive , he will survive"
you may not know my mother
my sisters or my brothers
yet everyone has given for the other
you know the working man
he builds what others plan
"so , everyone of us should sing his story"
"so , sing for the common man"
a song for the common man
he paid for the song with the sweat of his
"he will survive , he will survive"
dat after day
he keeps working away
"in offices , factories , and farms"
year after year
he sheds tear after tear
"he will provide , he will survive"
"so , sing for the common man"
a song for the common man
he paid for the song with the sweat of his
"he will survive , he will survive"
he will call you baby
but will he listen when you cry ?
he will call you sweetheart
but always seem apart .
"he will tear all your fences down ,"
trample all into the ground .
he will call you baby .
she will call you honey
and leave you twisting in the wind .
"she will call you darling ,"
keep you stunned and wondering .
she will take you to another world
where the winds of confusion swirl .
she will call you honey .
we should call them lucky
as they watch their babies dance .
or maybe call them crazy
for even thinking they have a chance .
they will carry her as far as they can
"then abandon her once again ,"
they will call her baby .
they will call her baby
i never worn a halo
do n't suppose i ever will
as far as saving me goes
it 's a battle up a hill
"but i keep climbin ' , tryin ' , fightin"
got a king james in the dresser
and i take it out sometimes
"but lord knows , i ai n't measured"
up to what 's inside
"and they say , `` but that 's okay ''"
but i keep praying for the day
that i can open up that good book
and heaven do n't look
like it 's out of reach
when it feels like those apostles
are giving me the gospel
and not the third degree
i just wanted to read
and not the biblе versus me
i woke up in last night 's clothеs
and it 's whisky on my lips
"if god 's looking down , i know"
he 's really looking down on this
but i have faith that i can change
i keep praying for the day
that i can open up that good book
and heaven do n't look
like it 's out of reach
when it feels like those apostles
are giving me the gospel
and not the third degree
i just wanted to read
and not the bible versus me
i 'm just tryin ' to give myself a little
'til those words and me get on the same page
and i can open up that good book
and heaven do n't look
like it 's out of reach
when it feels like those apostles
are giving me the gospel
and not the third degree
i just wanted to read

there you were
sitten on the patio .
watchin the moon and the stars .
here i was watching them twinkle in your eyes .
i never saw anything
so beautiful as you
chourse :
when i look into your eyes
they were all so beautiful
here we are talkin about forever
then as soon you walked out that door . my
just hurts as hell i told you before that i
then i saw you in the movies
i did n't even tell you before that .... i
oh i still do forever and ever
till the last day of my life
chourse2x
i always will till the last day of my life
i used to spend my nights out in a barroom
liquor was the only love i 'd known
but you rescued me from reachin ' for the bottom
and you brought me back from being too far gone
and you 're as smooth as tennessee whiskey
you 're as sweet as strawberry wine
you 're as warm as a glass of brandy
and i stay stoned on your love all the time
"oh , i looked for love in all the same"
found the bottom of the bottle always dry
so when you poured out your heart i did n't
'cause there 's nothing like your love to get me
"baby , you 're as smooth as tennessee whiskey"
you 're as sweet as strawberry wine
you 're as warm as a glass of brandy
and i stay stoned on your love all the time
"honey , you 're as smooth as tennessee whiskey"
you 're as sweet as strawberry wine
you 're as warm as a glass of brandy
and i stay stoned on your love all the time
true in this modern world when two lovers get together
chances of'em ever makin ' it to forever
could n't be better than two in a million hearts
girl this ai n't just another run of the mill
what i 'm feelin ' is the definition of devotion
my love for you is true
"true , like the sun comin ' up each mornin"
bright as the light in a baby 's smile
sure as a mountain river windin '
right as the rain fallin ' from the sky
"girl my love for you , is true"
"true , not another minute on this earth can be"
so there 's no way to know when i 'll
"but everyday i get , i 'll share with you"
this feelin ' just keeps gettin ' stronger as the
"it 's written on my face , you can see"
my love for you is true
"true , like the sun comin ' up each mornin"
bright as the light in a baby 's smile
sure as a mountain river windin '
right as the rain fallin ' from the sky

as i waltz in the arms of somebody new
could it be what i feel may be too much
"but the way that you touch me , i want"
it 's not so easy holding you when
you 're dancing this dance all wrong
new steps do n't come easy when old memories hang
i 'm finding i 'm falling as the music plays
keep dancing this dance all wrong
a new partner 's touch to an old partner 's
i 'm getting the feeling as we dance along
two strangers tonight wo n't be strangers for long
keep dancing this dance all wrong
you 're dancing this dance all wrong
new steps do n't come easy when old memories hang
i 'm finding i 'm falling as the music plays

i once thopught of love as a prison a place
so long ago i made a decision to be footloose
but you cam i was so tempted to gamble on
i never thought i would get caught .
it seemed liek the perfect crime .
"baby , you left me defneseless ."
i 've only got one plea .
lock me away inside of your love and throw away
i 'm guilty of love in the first degree .
"i thought it would be so simple , like a"
i 'd take what i wanted and just walk away
"now babe , i 'm not beggin ' for mercy"
go ahead and throw the book at me .

and felt that winter wind blow cold
a man learns who is there for him
when the glitter fades and the walls wo n't hold
"'cause from then , rubble"
what remains can only be what 's true
"if all was lost , it 's more i 've"
'cause it led me back to you
"and from now on , these eyes will not be"
"from now on , what 's waited 'til tomorrow starts"
and let this promise in me start like an anthem
"from now on , from now on"
i drank champagne with kings and queens
the politicians praised my name
but those are someone else 's dreams
the pitfalls of the man i became
"for years and years , i chased their cheers"
at the crazy speed of always needing more
but when i stop and see you here
i remember who all this was for
"and from now on , these eyes will not be"
"and rom now on , what 's waited 'til tomorrow"
it starts tonight
and let this promise in me start like an anthem
"from now on , from now on , from now"
and we will come back home
"and we will come back home , home again"
and we will come back home
"and we will come back home , home again"
and we will come back home
"and we will come back home , home again"
"from now on , these eyes will not be blinded"
"and from now on , what 's waited 'til tomorrow"
it starts tonight
and let this promise in me start like an anthem
"from now on , from now on , from now"
and we will come back home
"and we will come back home , home again"
and we will come back home
"and we will come back home , home again"

but he 's been feeling that way too a whole
"and interested , oh i 'm sure he 'd be"
i can almost speak for him
he 's that close to me
maybe in each other
they might find the lover
they 've been missin ' until now
they 'd trust the judgment of
two friends like us who care so much
can we get them togetherâ€¦somehow
i 've got this friend
"yeah , i think i know her"
my arms can almost feel the way he 'd hold
itâ€™s like he 's here when you describe him
and if he 's anything like you i 'm sure
maybe in each other
they might find the lover
they 've been missin ' until now
they 'd trust the judgment of

"we were young , barely outta school"
fell in love like lovers do
and the whole world seemed brand new
had a little girl and a little boy
how we shared in our pride and joy
and each day another dream came true
somehow it all just slipped away
oh how a memory fades
sunny skies turned to grey
tomorrow became yesterday
you had a smile that i recall
i see you laughin ' there in the hall
with that look twinklin ' in your eyes
we used to talk for hours on end
dreamed of forever remember when
the only thing i did n't love was saying goodbye
now we stand here on the fray
not really knowin ' just what to say
should i go or should i stay
tomorrow became yesterday [ x3 ]
"we were young , barely outta school"
fell in love like lovers do
and the whole world seemed brand new
never dreamed how things would change
how our lives have rearranged
i 'd look around and you 'd be gone
somehow you just moved on
now it 's time to turn the page
walk away to another stage
i pray to god this memory never fades
tomorrow became yesterday [ x2 ]

fell in love like lovers do
and the whole world seemed brand new

he bade me look the other way i saw a
he said if i 'd be lifted up i 'll
he turned and then i saw the nail scared hands

it was no dream he turned my way again i
he said if i 'd be lifted up ...

i have lived in a junkyard
where the weeds eat up the rain
if you get anything there out of place
you know there 's hell to pay
"and he said , `` you 're as sick as"
and in need of a hand. ``
"he tells me , `` you are never worthy ,"
"but i was just a child , you see ?"
that was my reality
he had a sick little girl
"dirty and hard , with a breast plate made of"
she drives all day in her rusty buick
and her feet do n't reach the pedals
"got a jar of flies , father 's disguise"
where his heart should be
her mouth is sewn together
she screams with those eyes
"`` she is sick , she is lovely"
and in need of my hand. `` ( yeah he
"he tells her , `` you are never worthy. ``"
"she was all alone , you see ?"
that was her reality
i should have been sleeping
should have been dreaming
but i wake up to broken glass
there 'll be one more empty desk in my homeroom
i got an old bone pocket knife tight in my
to save my poor mother from the junkyard man !
he 's as sick as she is lovely
and in need of a hand
he will know he 's not worthy
"when he dies alone , you see ?"
that '' s his reality
"i 'm not sick , i am lovely"
hatred is the curse of man
i will not feel unworthy
"because i have washed my hands , you see ?"
that 's my reality

'cause it 's gone in a blink
and the older i get
the truer it is
"it 's the people you love , not the money"
that makes you rich
and if they found a fountain of youth
i would n't drink a drop and that 's the
funny how it feels i 'm just getting to my
the older i get
the fewer friends i have
but you do n't need a lot when the ones
have always got your back
and the older i get
the better i am
at knowing when to give
and when to just not give a damn
and if they found a fountain of youth
i would n't drink a drop and that 's the
funny how it feels i 'm just getting to my
the older i get
and i do n't mind all the lines
from all the times i 've laughed and cried
souvenirs and little signs of the life i 've lived
the older i get
the longer i pray
"i do n't know why , i guess that i"
got more to say
and the older i get
the more thankful i feel
"for the life i 've had , and all the"
the hills were alive with wildflowers
"and i was as wild , even wilder than they"
"for at least i could run , they just died"
and i refused to just wither in place
"just a wild mountain rose , needing freedom to grow"
so i ran fearing not where i 'd go
"when a flower grows wild , it can always survive"
wildflowers do n't care where they grow
and the flowers i knew in the fields where i
were content to be lost in the crowd
"they were common and close , i had no room"
i wanted so much to branch out
i uprooted myself from home ground and left
took my dreams and i took to the road
"when a flower grows wild , it can always survive"
wildflowers do n't care where they grow
i grew up fast and wild and i never felt
in a garden so different from me
"i just never belonged , i just longed to be"
"so the garden , one day , set me free"
hitched a ride with the wind and since he was
i just let him decide where we 'd go
"when a flower grows wild , it can always survive"
wildflowers do n't care where they grow
"i wandered so aimless , life filled with sin"
i would n't let my dear saviour in
then jesus came like a stranger in the night
"praise the lord , i saw the light"
"i saw the light , i saw the light"
"no more darkness , no more night"
"now i 'm so happy , no sorrow in sight"
"praise the lord , i saw the light"
"just like the blind man , i wandered along"
"worries and fears , i claimed for my own"
"then like the blind man , that god gave back"
"praise the lord , i saw the light"
"i saw the light , i saw the light"
"no more darkness , no more night"
"now i 'm so happy , no sorrow in sight"
"praise the lord , i saw the light"
i was a fool to wander and stray
for straight is the gate and narrow the way
"now i have traded , the wrong for the right"
"praise the lord , i saw the light"
"i saw the light , i saw the light"
"no more darkness , no more night"
"now i 'm so happy , no sorrow in sight"
"praise the lord , i saw the light"
i can tell that somewhere there 's someone you loved
someone you loved more than me
and it hurts to say it but you have the
i know that 's the way it should be
but i 'm too far gone too far gone
i 've loved you so much for so long i
if ever your new love should hurt you or make
hurt you or make you feel blue
remember your old love will still be around loving you
cause i 'm too far gone ...
in this awful world of sorrow
on this wicked path of sin
never thinking of tomorrow
or what i 'd lose in the end
oh i can hear ( oh i can hear )
where my friends ( where my friends ) and loved
oh i can hear the angels singing ( sweet singing
just inside ( just inside ) those pearly gates
i can hear my savior calling
saying come unto me
wash away your sins forever
and you shall rest eternally
now i 'm safe with my jesus
he will guide me on my way
i will sing his praise forever
we 'll meet in heaven some sweet day
i wake up to your kiss
and that smile you sometimes smile
when you barely part your lips
then we both stumble out of bed
then sometimes fall back in all over again
"together we both face each brand new day ,"
"sometimes , it makes me stop and say"
where would i be without your love
what would i do without your touch
if i needed someone to hold and
the world turned its cold shoulder on me
where would i be
when i get home dog-tired from work
all you have to do is give me that smirk
and the whole days trouble melts away
and a firey passion stirs itself in me
you pull me back when i 'm standing on a
oh girl you make me stop and think
where would i be without your love
what would i do without your touch
if i needed someone to hold and
the world turned its cold shoulder on me
where would i be
too many nights of lonely
thats just enough to show me
do n't ever leave
where would i be without your love
what would i do without your touch
if i needed someone to hold and
the world turned its cold shoulder on me
where would i be
"we say goodbye , see you around"
we turn our backs then turn back around

if i quit my job for the simple life
honey would you stand by me
if i bought a little cabin on a mountainside
honey would you stand by me
would you be my one true friend
stick with me through thick and thin
if the roof was old and the rain came in
honey would you stand by me
if i tried my luck in hollywood
honey would you stand by me
if my break never came like i thought it would
honey would you stand by me
would you be my heart of gold
and never complain when the money was low
if your coat was thin and your shoes were old
honey would you stand by me
and if i joined up with the rodeo
honey would you stand by me
if we traveled around from show to show
honey would you stand by me
would you be a cowboy 's dream
and smile right on when times got lean
if you did n't have nothin ' but boots and
honey would you stand by me
honey would you stand
honey would you stand by me
honey would you stand
honey would you stand by me
honey would you stand
i once was blind
but now i see
i took him for granted
she took him from me
i once had a love
but now now i have none
"and i 'm , i 'm as blue as can"
i treated him a-wrong
"and now i 'm , i 'm all alone"
i took him for granted
she took him from me
well if i had known then
just what i know now
i would 've treated him so differently
"and if i , if i had known"
well then i
i could 've shown him more love
than he 'll ever see from her
i thought i had his love
in the palm of my hand
"but i , i guess she showed me"
"and now i , i understand"
"just how she , she got my man"
i took him for granted
she took him from me
when you start falling
who 's gon na catch ya
i 'm willing to betcha
it will be me
who 's gon na love ya
like there 's no other
search and discover
it will be me
when all the others
have gone and hurt you
who wo n't desert you
it will be me
weighing the options
so much to think of
but when you think love
it will be me
you may not see it now
love is strange that way
"but someday , someway"
baby somehow
when you 've been broken
and dreams do n't oblige ya
who 's that beside ya
"oh , it will be me"
who 'll be your only
true romancer
you know the answer
it will be me
what will it take to
bring you to your senses
and finally convince you
it will be me
he told a good story and all of us kids
'bout his life on the border and the way it
and we all believed him and when he would finish
we 'd ask the old cowboy to tell 'em again
you could almost hear those prairie winds blowin '
his saddle a creakin ' 'neath his old faded jeans
you could taste the dry dust from the trail he
as he sat there and painted those west texas scenes
and the grown-ups would tell us
"you boys keep your distance , that old man 's"
but to all of us kids cowboy bill was a
just as true as his blue texas skies
he told of a time when he rode with the
down on the pecos and he saved the day
"outnumbered by plenty , they were almost too cover"
with thirty banditos headed their way
he looked back just in time to see a horse
the captain went down and bill pulled up on his
and through a flurry of bullets he rescued the captain
"and they rode for a sunset , just the story"
well i still remember the day that it happened
we waited and we waited but bill never showed
and the follks at the feed store said they had
so we set out for his place down old grist
and we cried when we found him lying there with
"the old trunk wide open , things scattered about"
he was clutchin ' a badge that said texas ranger
and an old `` yeller '' letter said texas is
now who would n't notice the fire in your eyes
or the bitter direction of impending good-byes
"i 've followed and folded , i 'm wilted in"
at the sight of you standing with streaks down your
with your heart broke and running from the reason
"you got your heart broke , do n't give up"
"heart broke , who kept me from leaving ?"
with my heart broke
now pride is a drag and a bore when you
sheer madness prevails upon reason to you
"but all is not lost , it 's only mistaken"
that 's small consolation but i know just how you
with your heart broke and running from the reason
"you got your heart broke , do n't give up"
"heart broke , who kept me from leaving ?"
with my heart broke
nobody said it was going to be easy
we all have feelings that need a softer touch
but nobody said that it would not be worth it
the human condition continues as such
with your heart broke and running from the reason
"you & otilde ; ve got your heart broke ,"
"heart broke , who kept me from leaving ?"
"with my heart broke , you & otilde ; ve"

i used to like
making love then
getting up
and never having to explain
i 've always been free
i never could see me
dragin ' no ball and chain
i like running around
and being tied down
never was my cup of tea
but since i 've been holding an angel
a little heaven 's rubbing off on me
and i 'm beginning to like just sittin ' and
looking into her eyes i 'm thinking about future plans
and then i get the feeling that the life that
up to be
since i 've been holding an angel
a little heaven 's rubbing off on me
i used like
to spend the night
sittin ' on an old bar stool
drinkin ' wine and killing time
with all over those other fools
but since you took my hand
i think i understand
it ai n't the way it outta be
since i 've been holding an angel
a little heaven 's rubbing off on me
and i 'm beginning to like just sittin ' and
looking into her eyes i 'm thinking about future plans
and then i get the feeling that the life that
up to be
since i 've been holding an angel
a little heaven 's rubbing off on me

forgive me but it all seems so unreal to me
"and my heart and me , we 'd made so"

but do you mind too much if i do n't
do you mind too much if i do n't understand
tonight as i lay on the boxcar
just waiting for a train to pass by
what will become of the hobo
when his time comes to die
there 's a master up yonder in heaven
got a place that we might call our home
will we have to work for a living
or can we continue to roam
will there be any freight trains in heaven
any boxcars in which we might hide
will there by any tough cops or brakemen
will they tell us that we can not ride
will the hobo chum with the rich man
will we always have money to spare
will they have respect for the hobo
in that land that lies up there

if you offered me a shade of blue
would i return it saying that it was too
dark or light ?
or would i see it for the precious thing
that it might one day be ?
hold on to me
if you offered me a point of view
would i dismiss it saying that it was too
black and white ?
or would i see it as the special thing
that it would no doubt be ?
hold on to me
i 'll hold on to this gift we share
it is as slippery as it is rare
i 'll hold on to that feeling
of waking and finding you there
i 'll hold on to you and you hold on

would you do it without too much thinking or fuss
would you see it for the precious thing
that it would surely be ?

a little wisdom on a souvenir
another bottle with an s. o. s
throw it in the water and pray for the best
there ai n't a compass or a northern star
that ever really tells us where we are
we 're just a shore runnin ' out of sand
and reachin ' for a hand
every heart is an island
but no one 's alone
ship wrecked in a high wind

and every tear is an ocean
we 're all brothers in a storm

every heart is an island
silverlinin ' is kinda hard to find
when the world stops at the horizon line
there ai n't a harbor that you 'll recognize
it 's hard to make a wish in an empty
boardwalks are just nails and wood
the pretty and a picture when times are good
cars and boats are just on loan
our house is just sticks and stones
every heart is an island
but no one 's alone

and every tear is an ocean

and we 're tyrin ' to survive it

ah ! it ’ s just another wasted mornin ’
while i ’ m holdin ’ up the wall
too much tequila makes me wonder
why i ’ m headin ’ home at all
get that honky tonk feelin ’
every time your arms grow cold
i suppose that ’ s the reason
i need a home away from home
so i ’ ll say one more time
and i hope you ’ ll understand
if i can ’ t find it in your arms
i ’ m gon na find it where i can
i can ’ t refuse them lonely women
"lord , i know just how they feel"
i suppose that ’ s the reason
what you been givin ’ me makes me feel
"honey , i ’ m gettin ’ that honky tonk"
every time your arms grow cold
and i suppose that ’ s the reason
i need a home away from home
"so i ’ ll say it one more time ,"
and i hope you ’ ll understand
if i can ’ t find it in your arms
i ’ m gon na find it where i can
if i can ’ t find it in your arms
i ’ m gon na find it where i can

you think you 're smart
you broke my heart
left me to cry here alone
but you 'll return
one day you 'll learn
the heart you break may be your own
you promised me
your love would be
a kind i 'd never known
tho ' you were n't fair
you 're unaware
the heart you break may be your own
you used my heart for a plaything
"you 'll be sorry , just wait and see"
one day you 'll find you are lonely
and the first one you 'll think of is me
you 'll look around
and when you 've found
that you are all alone
then you 'll get wise
and realize
the heart you break may be your own

met the girl i-i love in a town way down
beneath the stars up above
she was the sweetest girl i ever did see
so i held her in my arms and told her
kissed her while the guitars played
the bonaparte 's retreat
guitar .....
all the world wa-as bright as i held her on
and i heard her-er say
please do n't you go away
so i held her in my arms and told her
kissed her while the bagpipe played

"yes i held her in my arms , i told"
kissed her while everybody 's playin ' ( fade )
so much for never makin ' the same mistake
i ca n't believe i 'm here again
so much for ever thinkin ' that i could change
my good intentions still remain in chains
she 's got ta be over me now
probably moved on with her life
found someone she knows she can believe
god i would give anything if i could just go
and be the man she needed me to be
i thought i was a hero
i played him well
he saves the day but not himself
i acted out the lover
my finest part
had all the lines but not the heart
no look where we are
"be the man that she could trust , who put"
"who tamed his demons , who healed her hurts"
"in health and sickness , who helped her grow"
"with no resentment , true repentance , god as my"
she needed me to be
"she needed me to be , oh"
"whoa , hallelujah"
"yeah , i could be that man she needed me"

and you look fine with your smile so angel soft
but you always look your best here in my arms

and we feel so good holding each other
i 'm depending on your tender love to keep me
yes you always look your best here in my arms
i 'm depending on your warm and tender love to

when my strength is not enough to face the disapointments
when nothing seems to work out like i planned
"when i think i 've reached the end , just"
"cause i can make it , if you say i"
"if you say i can , then i can find"
in knowing you believe that much in me
tell me that i can and give me faith in
i 'm only just as strong as you make me
"but i can do it , if you say i"
when i 've reached the point of thinking life 's
when i ca n't seem to give what life demands
when it seems impossible to make it any farther
"i can go on , if you say i can"
"if you say i can , then i can find"
in knowing you believe that much in me
tell me that i can and give me faith in
i 'm only just as strong as you make me

yes and i 've often felt forsaken and certainly misused

still you do n't expect to be bright and bon
so far away from home so far away from home
do n't know a soul who has not been battered
do n't have a friend who feels at ease
i do n't know a dream that 's not been
oh but it 's alright it 's alright for we
still when i think of the road we 're traveling
i ca n't help it i wonder what 's gone
and i dreamed i was dying i dreamed that my
looking back down at me smiled reassuredly
i dreamed i was flying high up above my eyes
the statue of liberty sailing away to sea
and i dreamed i was flying
we come on the ship they call the mayflower come
we come in the age 's most uncertain hours and
oh but it 's alright it 's alright ca n't
still tomorrow 's gon na be another working day and
that 's all i 'm trying to get some rest
by now i bet she 's wonderin ' how i
if it broke my heart when she told me goodbye
well every night i sleep just like a baby
i wake up every hour and cry
i 'll bet she even thinks i 'm gon na
she probably thinks she 's always on my mind
but every night i sleep just like a baby
i wake up every hour and cry
she believes that i ca n't live without her
and it hurts so bad some times i almost die
well every night i sleep just like a baby
i wake up every hour and cry
( spoken )
you know i bet way down deep
that she thinks i 'll always love her
and i 'll bet she thinks i 'll never
love another no matter how hard i try
but every night i sleep just like a baby
i wake up every hour and cry
lord every night i sleep just like a little bitty
i wake up every hour and cry
to be alone with you
"oh just , just we two"
"for my , my dream come true"
is to be alone with you .
"but , you , oh you do n't know"
"what is on , what 's on my mind"
"for i , i tried to tell you"
"for so many , many times ."
one day i wo n't be afraid
i 'll tell you i love you so
"and i wonder darling , if you will feel the"
"yes i can only hope , i 'll i 'll"
alone with you .
and you 're gon na say you love me too
oh my my dreams come true

a paper cup a paper plate a different boy each

i 'm looking for a silver and a crystal world
not an artificial world but one that 's real
shiny plastic flowers electronic steeple chimes
seem to be becoming the symbols of our times
i 'm looking for a simple sandy suntan world
not a handy sunlamp world but one that is true

i went downtown thought i had a dime
got home this morning did n't have a dime
lordy lordy lordy got the dog house blues
no use talkin ' i got the dog house blues
come home this morning about half past eight
she said honey you 're out too late
lordy lordy lordy got the dog house blues
no use talkin ' i got the dog house blues
i went in the house to start the fire
she kicked me out in the middle of the night
lordy lordy lordy got the dog house blues
no use talkin ' i got the dog house blues
i fell in the yard mad as i can be
said to my dog make room for me

straight-backed chair and a table
where he sits when he 's able
to walk over from bedridden misery
to record from his thoughts
on a worn out table cloth
where he 'd been while
his mind breaks sleeplessly
though his body 's bent with age
"you know , he 's still out on that stage"
entertaining all his friends
that pause to greet him at the door
forty-nine years out on the road
many nights he 'd saved a soul
now he sits and waits
to claim his own reward
god 's own singer of songs is going home
"though he 's poor , he might be"
the richest one you know
all his pain will set him free
wash his soul and cleans him clean
god 's own singer of songs is going home
god 's own singer of songs is going home
hear 'em singing happy birthday
better think about the wish i made
this year gone by ai n't been a piece of
every day 's a revolution
pull it together and it comes undone
just one more candle and a trip around the sun
i 'm just hanging on while this old world keeps
and it 's good to know it 's out of
if there 's one thing that i 've learned from
is that it would n't change a thing if i
"no , you never see it coming"
always wind up wondering where it went
only time will tell if it was time well spent
it 's another revelation
celebrating what i should have done
with these souvenirs of my trip around the sun
"yes , i 'll make a resolution"
then i 'll never make another one
just enjoy this ride on my trip around the sun
just enjoy this ride ...
until it 's done
"there ought to be a town out there ,"
named for how i feel .
"yeah i could be the mayor down there ,"
and say welcome to sorryville .
"it wo n't be on a map nowhere ,"
"you might say that it does n't exist ,"
but if you make enough wrong turns
it 'd be hard to miss .
they could dedicate to me .
i 'd probably come to the ceremony
with a can of gasoline ;
walk on over to the other side
and there i 'd light a match
and sit and stare through the smoke and the flames
wonderin ' how i 'm ever gon na get back
why do i do the things i do ?
was i born this way ? am i a self-made
i shoot the lights and curse the dark ;
i need your love but i break your heart ;
and i know the words that 'll bring you back
but i do n't say nothin ' as i watch
i had to work to be the jerk i 've
it ai n't easy bein ' me .
ought to be a side show act for freaks like
yeah i could be the star of the show
with my name on the marquee .
in a room with a big red button that says
and twice a day i 'd mash it down
and you could watch me self-destruct .
why do i do the things i do ?
was i born this way ? am i a self-made
i shoot the lights and curse the dark ;
i need your love but i break your heart ;
and i know the words that 'll bring you back
but i do n't say nothin ' as i watch
i had to work to be the jerk i 've
it ai n't easy bein ' me .
of all the roads i 've traveled and all the
the most amazing thing is the power of our dreams
and anything is possible for those who can believe
just get your heart to rearrange its priorities
for us to make love work
we 've got to try a little harder
and for love to work we got ta hold on
a human heart is just too precious
to spend it feeling hurt
let 's start to take the chance to make love
it takes faith in one another to see things eye
and it 's hard to trust but you know it
there 's a candle in my window and whenever you
you can bet your bottom dollar i 'll be there
for us to make love work
we 've got to try a little bit harder
and for love to work we got ta hold on
a human heart is just too precious
to spend it feeling hurt
let 's start to take the chance to make love
oh i do believe in miracles
but i know they do n't come easy
so why do n't we give destiny
a helping hand
for us to make love work
we 've got to try a little bit harder
and for love to work we got ta hold on
a human heart is just too precious
to spend it feeling hurt
let 's start to take the chance to make love
life is just too beautiful
to spend it feeling hurt
let 's start to take the chance to make love
did someone say work ?

i 'm sorry i snapped and lost my head
those angry words were so far from the truth

i 'd die before i 'd ever let you go
until you 're in my arms again
i 'll fight for you 'til the very end
i still believe

i 'd die before i 'd ever let you go
until you 're in my arms again
i 'll fight for you 'til the very end
i still believe
"no mas amore , no mas amore aqui"
no love to be found
"no one around now , but me"
last time i saw her
was down by the edge of the sea
"no mas amore , no mas amore aqui"
i would have followed you to anywhere
nowhere i would n't have gone
you could have taken me anywhere
you had to go it alone
"no mas amore , no mas amore aqui"
no love to be found
"no one around now , but me"
last time i saw her
was down by the edge of the sea
"no mas amore , no mas amore aqui"
down by the rocks
where the waves play the shore like a drum
sometimes i swear
i can hear her guitar gently strum
i walk the beach
underneath the moons pale blue light
haunted by the song
of a love lost to the changing tide
i would have followed you to anywhere
nowhere i would n't have gone
you could have taken me anywhere
you had to go it alone
"no mas amore , no mas amore aqui"
no love to be found
"no one around now , but me"
last time i saw her
was down by the edge of the sea
"no mas amore , no mas amore aqui"
"no mas amore , no mas amore aqui"

she was only ten when her daddy got fired
he drank away the family home and left them all
and then her mommy was just too tired
so she got sent away
she moved in with her aunt in arizona
everything was fine until she told on uncle bill
when he said he only wanted to hold her
she had to run away
"but when it rains , the past gets washed away"
she smiles 'cause she knows in the end
"the world gets beautiful , beautiful again"
her boyfriend said i 'm way too young to get
but she made up her mind that somehow she was
find a way to keep that baby she carried
and he just walked away
and when she 's lying all alone
thinkin ' about her life she wonders
if she is wrong to believe in a better world
then she sees her little girl
and she knows she is right 'cause
a big moon is risin '
so bright in the sky
but it wo n't shine brighter
than the stars in your eyes
it rises above me
so bright and so blue
and i wo n't see anyone
as lovely as you
take me into the night
pass these lonely dreams
in my heart
i love you
more than i can show you
more than i can know in my heart
so lay down beside me
and hold me tonight
for your love has found me
and it feels so right
these thoughts in my mind
are so scattered and few
but i wo n't see anyone
as lovely as you
take me into the night
pass these lonely dreams
in my heart
i love you
more than i can show you
more than i can know in my heart
in my heart
"wild rebel rose , the kids used to tease you"
"wild rebel rose , every time they 'd see you"
in those black turtle necks in mid july
wearin ' too much makeup 'round your eyes
"wild rebel rose , i did n't know you"
"wild rebel rose , so i never told you"
how i 'd watch from the house across the street
when those blue lights came around
at least three times a week
it 's hard for anyone to understand
why at sixteen you just up and ran
they did n't know you only knew your daddy 's
like the back of his hand
"i heard the shots , saw you hit the door"
i snuck in and grabbed that pistol off the floor
do n't you worry they wo n't find it that
"wild rebel rose , the kids used to tease you"
"wild rebel rose , every time they 'd see you"
in those black turtle necks in mid july
wearin ' too much makeup 'round your eyes
"hmm , oh , wild , wild , wild rebel"
"they did n't know , ooh , yeah , hmm"
her momma 's still got that sequin gown that she
she taught her early how to smile that smile and
the parade
it took a whole lot of years and tears
for her momma to finally admit
no matter how many stitches and pins
that old dress was never gon na fit
she was daddy 's little girl
momma 's little angel
"teacher 's pet , pageant queen"
"she said , `` all my life i 've been"
waking up in someone else 's dream ''
"her daddy used to say , `` you 'll make"
he 'll ride up on a big white horse and
it took twenty-five years and some broken vows
before they 'd finally see
there 's a little more to love and life
than fairy tales and hand me down dreams
she was daddy 's little girl
momma 's little angel
"teacher 's pet , pageant queen"
"she said , `` all my life i 've been"
waking up in someone else 's dream ''
now she 's got twenty-seven candles on her cake
and she means to make her life her own
before there 's twenty-eight
she was daddy 's little girl
momma 's little angel
"teacher 's pet , pageant queen"
"she said , `` all my life i 've been"
waking up in someone else 's dream ''
awww but something sure is missin
somethings just aint the same
now he thinks back on yesterday
all those victory lanes
better wars just to steal the race
and to taste that sweet champagne
you either loved him or you hated him
intimidation was to blame
now days each time they drop that flag
somethings just aint the same
somethings just aint the same
ohhh they miss the man today
so they standin next to cheer
and wish the man was here
somethings just aint the same
na na na na na na na
na na na na na na na
awww he starts up that old chevy truck
and he leaves the parking lot
hes thinks of all he 'd done today
and he thanks god for what hes got
his youngest son sittin by his side
dale jr 's still a fan
he knows the future 's lookin bright
but he wont forget the man
somethings just aint the same
ohhh they miss the man today
so they standin next to cheer
and wish the man was here
somethings just never change
so they standin next to cheer
and toast him with their beer
somethings will never change
nooo no noooo
( softer spoken )
theres a three upon his ball cap
and a three upon his shirt
he remembers how he ran this track
and all those old ones in the dirt
my father 's stories fell upon us
filled us with his light
"gospels , fertile minds"
"taking root , taking root"
his pocket change would jingle
sacramental bells
heads tucked low
"sneaking peaks , sneaking peaks"
and the rain comes down
"it 's dark , and the browns"
begin to bite
here you will always be
"behind me , and you will not go away"
"there he sleeps , an untamed land"
dark corners yet discovered
his heart yet to be
"trod upon , trod upon"
i ca n't bare to hear his breathing
simply knowing what 's to come
i ca n't bare to hear your breathing
knowing what 's to come
"hello , i am your heart"
and you got me broken one too many times
"oh , hello , this is your heart speaking"
and you got me hurt boy one too many times
going away on a little vacation
i 'll be gone quite a while
you wo n't have you no love making
you 'll just have that ten cent smile
"goodbye , this is your heart leaving"
i wish you the best of luck
while i 'm healing up
oh hello this is your heart
i just telephoned to see how you 're getting by
oh hello this is your heart calling
"well , i 've got to run now but i"
i 'm having fun on my little vacation
i may be gone a while
you wo n't have you no love making
you 'll just have that ten cent smile
hello this is your heart
i wish you the best of luck
while i 'm healing up
oh goodbye
goodbye
d a
i grew up in wyoming
d
in and around jackson 's hole
a
in the shadows of the tetons
where summers are hot
d
and winters unbearably cold
g
but the spring and the fall
d
are always as good as it gets
a
for over 70 years now
d
i 'd watch the sun rise and set
a
i 've been a cowboy
d
working the round-ups in spring
a
i 've lived in the mountains
hunted the grizzly
d
trapping the rivers and streams
g
always the loner
d
i 've treasured my freedom the most
a
and though i never married
d
as a young man i might have come close
g
from somewhere back east
she came to the valley
d
with a man who did her no good
g
he was fast with the ladies
a tin horn gambler
d
and a cheat whenever he could
g
she had no friends or family
d
most of the time he was gone
a
he died in a card game
d
and she found herself all alone
g
alone and afraid and left unprotected
d
'cause he was all that she had
g
maybe i should have
but i never told her
d
so she never knew he was bad
g
but i 'll always remember
d
standing and watching her cry
a
there was no one to help her
d
but i was determined to try
a
i mended her fences and
fixed up her cabin
d
i had everything looking good
a
i laid by her food
and wood for the winter
d
helping wherever i could
g
the more i was around her
d
the more i wanted to be
a
there was something about her
d
that brought out a good side of me
g
"i went into town , i brought a new outfit"
d
i got me a haircut and shave
g
i 'd trek through the snow
for no good reason
d
just to go by her cabin each day
g
i do n't know about love
d
but i was quite taken in by it all
a
till her brother came in the spring
d
and he took her back to st. paul
a
i do n't go down to jackson
d
ai n't nothing there but motels and bars
a
too damn many tourists
no place to hide
d
they 'll find you wherever you are
g
they like to call me old timer
d
i am getting older i guess
a
but i do n't like the changes
d
'cause i 've seen it all at its best
a
when my life is over
d
i do n't want to be left in town
a
but up in the mountains
there is a place
d
i 've marked off my own piece of ground
g
high in the tetons
d
above and away from it all
a
from the top of old grand
i bet on a clear day - you can see
d
all the way to st. paul
mama let me bring your old harmonica to you
i 'll get out my guitar and we 'll play
we 'll let the music take us back to when
take our minds of everything in the way it always
we 'll play `` you are my sunshine ''
we 'll do `` amazing grace ''
we 'll stop and catch our breath
and let our laughter fill this place
and it 's too bad with all the family
dad 's not here to play along
we 'll get back together and it wo n't be
will the circle be unbroken ? you always said it
and we 'll all meet again someday and feel it
when the room is cold up yonder and tawnyoo is
we 'll be shoutin ' and a singin ' precious
and we 'll play `` you are my sunshine ''
and do `` amazing grace ''
and stop and catch our breath
and let our laughter fill this place
"with all the family , dad will be right there"
when we get back together and it wo n't be
when we get back together and it wo n't be
whenever i chance to meet
some old friend who 's on the street
they wonder how does a man
get to be this way
i 've always got a smiling face
anytime and any place
everytime they ask me why
i just smile and say
you 've got to
kiss an angel good morning
and let her know you think about her
when you 're gone
kiss an angel good morning
and love her like the devil
when you get back home
well people may try to guess
the secret of happiness
but some of them never learn
it 's a simple thing
the secret i 'm a-speaking of
"well , it 's a woman and a man in"
and the answer is in this song
that i always sing
you 've got to
kiss an angel good morning
and let her know you think about her
when you 're gone
kiss an angel good morning
and love her like the devil
when you get back home
kiss an angel good morning
and let her know you think about her
when you 're gone
kiss an angel good morning
and love her like the devil
when you get back home
kiss an angel good morning ...
you just ca n't stand to see me happy seems
still i go on loving you but i 'll never
oh the pain of loving you oh the mis'ry i
never knowing what to do oh the pain of loving
to love and hate at the same time the line
but too has bound me heart to soul so strong
oh the pain of loving you ...
oh the pain of loving you
( paul brandt/gene pastilli )
if this is n't love
what else could it be
what 's happenin to you
what 's happenin to me
if this is n't love
what else is so strong
or feels half as good
or lasts half as long
now i am not an expert
on matters such as this
romance has always left me in the dark
but with each brush of your sweet touch
and every lingering kiss
i think that cupid 's finally found his mark
could it be a bug
or maybe the flu
that 's goin around
you say that you 've got it too
if this is n't love
what else could it be
if this is n't love
then it 's alright with me
if this is n't love
is it obvious to you
when you walk into a room
your face is all i see
and my heart races so fast
i never knew a rush to feel like that
every time you 're touching me
i never did believe in anything
i could n't hold between my fingers
but the way you make me feel
it 's just so real the way it lingers
i get lost inside your stare
lost when you 're not there
when everything i have does n't mean a thing
if it 's without you
"if it 's a dream , do n't wake me"
i 'll scream if this is n't love
if being lost means never knowing
how it feels without you
i wan na stay lost forever
i wan na stay lost forever with you
"no , this feeling does n't end"
it 's with me everywhere i am
hope it never goes away
it 's like defying gravity
losing all control and being free
and i always wan na stay
i never thought that i 'd let go
long enough to fall for someone deeply
who had the power to erase my fears
and find me so completely
i get lost inside your stare
lost when you 're not there
when everything i have does n't mean a thing
if it 's without you
"if it 's a dream , do n't wake me"
i 'll scream if this is n't love
if bein ' lost means never knowin '
how it feels without you
i wan na stay lost forever
i wan na stay lost forever with you
do n't tell me where we 're goin '
i do n't wan na know
i like the mystery ( i like the mystery )
i ca n't believe we 've come this far
so far away from where we started off
you found me when i was n't looking
you found me
and now i 'm lost inside your stare
lost when you 're not there
and everything i have does n't mean a thing
if it 's without you
without you
if it 's a dream
do n't wake me up
i 'll scream if this is n't love
if being lost means never knowing
how it feels without you
"yeah , if being lost means never knowing"
how it feels without you
"oh , if being lost means that i 'm never"
gon na be without you
i wan na stay lost forever
i wan na stay lost forever with you
"maybe baby , i 'll have you"
"maybe baby , you 'll be true"
"maybe baby , i 'll have you for me"
"it 's funny honey , you do n't care"
you never listen to my prayers
"maybe baby , you will love me someday"
"well , you are the one that makes glad"
any other woman just makes me sad
"when someday you want me , well ,"
"i 'll be there , wait and see"
"maybe baby , i 'll have you for me"
"tommy 's daddy , kept a six pack in the"
"we thought we were old enough ,"
to do what daddy 's did .
it did n't take us long to go
from drunk to really sick .
"when i walked in my house ,"
i stumbled just a bit .
"you play it cool ,"
"but it 's no use ,"
"dad ai n't no fool ,"
and that 's the truth .
"chewing gum wo n't cover ,"
up that smell .
"you ca n't hide one single thought ,"
"if you try , you 'll just get caught ."
when somebody knows you that well .
"we lost daddy ,"
in nineteen ninety-nine .
"i took care of everybody 's pain ,"
except for mine .
"and then one night ,"
my wife took my face in her hands .
"she said , `` i think it 's time you"
for your old man . ''
"you play it cool ,"
but it 's no use .
"she ai n't no fool ,"
and that 's the truth .
and my teardrops finally fell .
"you ca n't hide one single thought ,"
"if you try , you 'll just get caught ."
when somebody knows you that well .
"i could probably do more ,"
to help my fellow man .
"but life gets busy ,"
and i hope god understands .
"someday , when i get time ,"
i 'll do more than my share .
"funny how i 'm thinkin ' this ,"
sittin ' in my easy chair .
"you play it cool ,"
but it 's no use .
"god ai n't no fool ,"
and that 's the truth .
and he wo n't let you fool yourself .
"you ca n't hide one single thought ,"
"if you try , you 'll just get caught ."
when somebody knows you that well ...
when somebody knows you that well .
when we dance together my world 's in disguise
it 's a fairyland tale that 's come true
when you look at me girl with those stars in
i could waltz across texas with you
waltz across texas with you in my arms
waltz across texas with you
like a storybook ending i 'm lost in your charms
and i could waltz across texas with you
[ steel - piano - banjo ]
my heartaches and troubles are just up and gone
the moment you come into view
with your hand in mine dear i could dance on
and waltz across texas with you
waltz across texas with you in my arms ...
i can bring you back anytime i want to
i remember an angel in your veil of white so
you were always very near well i feel that you
it 's so real in the diary of my mind
on the first page there we are down by the
with the flowers blooming in the warm sunshine
speaking love words soft and sweet and as our lips
we 're together in the diary of my mind
yes i can bring you back anytime i want to
even though you been gone a long long time
oh i just close my eyes and then i realize
you 're right there in the diary of my mind
on the next page i can smell the yellow roses
you brought to this world our baby girl so fine
a princess for the queen i was such a happy
you 're both still here in the diary of my
yes even comes the page i do n't like to
the hist'ry shows that kingdoms fall with time
mistrust and deceit then the bottle it brought defeat
that 's the last scene that 's in the diary
but i can bring you back anytime i want to
even though you been gone a long long time
i just close my eyes and then i realize
you 're right there in the diary of my mind
you 're still here in the diary of my mind
are we fools for rushin ' in
cause i already dread the end
lonely ai n't no place to start
i guess that 's just where we are
oh how i remember well
the sunset on september 12
i disappeared to get a drink
you still kept your eyes on me
sometimes loves acts out of spite
and good things happen over night
ca n't take it slow cause you and i are
i did n't plan on fallin ' fast
i did n't know i could be kissed like that
no i 'm tradin ' miles for minutes
this bed 's too big without you in it
sometimes love acts out of spite
and good things happen over night
ca n't take it slow cause you and i are
you and i are pushin ' time
and they say only time can tell
you already know me well
if it has to end in tears
i hope that it 's in sixty years
sometimes love acts out of spite
and good things happen over night
ca n't take it slow cause you and i are
ca n't take it slow cause you and i are

and do n't slam that door
and you better be a sober man
or i 'll give you what for

except for you know well she says
you could take me to dinner
and you could buy me some clothes
if you make all that money man
make damn sure it shows
you could tell me you love me
to put off my blues
but what do you do
when it quits being new
and he says you could put on some makeup
and you could pile up your hair
and at least try to do something
with what you 've got there
you could tell me you love me
to put off my blues
but what do you do
say what do you do

just a block or
so you know come morning

everything to me

and that 's the glory of
and that 's the story of
what do you do
i went to a funeral
lord it made me happy
seeing all those people
i ai n't seen
since the last time
somebody died
everybody talking
they were telling funny stories
saying all those things
they ai n't said
since the last time
somebody died
but you take a look around you
do n't it seem like something 's missing
i said something that were n't missing
lord the last time
somebody died
you took him from the last time
to that hallowed ground
i 'm praying take me to the next time lord
so i can hang around
then the people start to looking
and some of them start crying
and all the little children
lord they 're scared
because they ai n't never seen
a dead man before
you took him from the last time
to that hallowed ground
i 'm praying take me to the next time lord
so i can hang around
he 's swimming through that jordan
going to the other side
but if it 's all the same to you lord
i think i 'll stay dry
now it 's church on sunday
it 's a bar on friday night
it 's work on monday
the preacher lord you know he might sing
hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
he 's got church on sunday
and he got drunk the night before
and he got his good gal when he got home
the preacher said he wants some more of that
hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
now if you want to get to heaven
let me tell you what to do
you better grease your foot up buddy
with that mutton stew
and when the devil comes after you
with them greasy hands
you just slide on over to the promised land
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
now there was two little imps
and they was black as tar
and they was trying to get to heaven
in an electric car
and that car wheel slipped
on down the hill
instead of going to heaven
they went to jacksonville
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
sing hallelujah
"thank you , you 've been so nice"
all my friends they came
now close the lid down tightly
and quit crying
because when they close them
they all look the same
and grab hold of the handle
it wo n't be too heavy
and take me to the graveyard
i went to a funeral
and lord it made me happy
seeing all those people
i ai n't seen
since the last time
somebody ...
i took a short vacation
to the gulf of mexico
everyday i 'd see this fellow
with his tackle box and pole
and he 'd fish
and he 'd fish
all day long
so one day i went out walking
and when i got down to his spot
me and him got to talking
and said have you ever thought
about what you are going to do with your life
i said i 'm about to share with you
my secret to success
so you can go make something of yourself
you can sell these fish you 're catching
you can buy yourself a boat
hard work and dedication
and the next thing you know
you reinvest your money
you 'll be captain of the fleet
you 'll be sitting pretty down on easy street
and you can do anything that you wish
"he says , you mean fish ?"
his simple words of wisdom
hit me right between the eyes
and it really got me thinking
about the way i live my life
cause i just work
and i work
all day long
so i asked myself a question
that i knew the answer to
is success a second mortgage
on a big house with a pool
or is it a chair
the salt in the air
wetting the line
that advice that i tried to give him
to take him to the top
was really nothing more than just a crock
you can sell these fish you 're catching
you can buy yourself a boat
hard work and dedication
and the next thing you know
you reinvest your money
you 'll be captain of the fleet
you 'll be sitting pretty down on easy street
and you can do anything that you wish
"he says , you mean fish ?"
so i went and bought some tackle
and a bucket full of bait
you can find me here most days
with my chair sitting there next to his
we just fish
"yeah , we just fish"
"yeah fish , fish , fish , fish , fish"
high on a mountain in western montana
a silhouette moves 'cross a cinnamon sky
riding alone on a horse he called music
"with a song on his lips , and a tear"
"he dreams of a time , and a lady that"
and how he would sing her sweet lullabies
but we do n't ever ask him
and he never talks about her
guess it is better to just let it slide
but sang `` ooh '' to the ladies
"and ooh , he made some sigh"
now he rides away on a horse he called music
with a pain in his heart and a tear in
he rode the music from boston to bozeman
"for not too much money , but way to much"
but those were the days when a horse he called
could jump through the moon and sail across the sky
now all that 's left is a time-old worn cowboy
with nothin ' more than the sweet by-and-by
"and trailing behind , is a horse with no rider"
a horse he calls memories that she used to ride
and he sang `` ooh '' to the ladies
"and ooh , he damn near made some fall right"
now he rides away on a horse he called music
with a pain in his heart and a tear in
high on a mountain in western montana
"two crosses cut , through a cinnamon sky"
marking the place where a horse he called music
lays with a cowboy in the sweet by-and-by ...
i got your wedding invitation i 'm surprised you thought
but i do n't believe your wedding is just where
for you put your arms around her kissed her lips
as she 's standing there beside you that 's just
like a fool i introduced you i said baby meet
never thought that i could lose you but i lost
i took the diamond ring you gave me threw it
and i had an awful feeling that 's just where
da da da de de dee da ...
like a fool i introduced you ...

and then you swing them to the left you swing

and then you do the eagle rock with the style

there 's a tangled mess of sheets on the bed
a lack of sleep poundin ' in my head
we both regret some of the things we said
but we love the way it ends
sometimes i think
we hurt each other just because of where it 'll
sometimes i think
we 're fighting just to be lovers
and all so needlessly
good as we are at gettin ' it on
how come we just ca n't get along ?
"the way we love , it do n't seem right"
"the way we fuss , the way we fight"
"i got a crazy idea , how 'bout maybe tonight"
we make up without a fight
"they say do n't go to bed angry , that"
but it 's really something when we do
"( madder you make me , the more i want"
"girl , i admit"
sometimes i think
it could n't be any better
( and i could n't want you more )
and sometimes i think
we do n't belong together
confusing love and war
good as we are at gettin ' it on
how come we just ca n't get along ?

dancing and prancing in jingle bell square

to go gliding in a one-horse sleigh

the flies have quit their buzzing
even bear has stopped his barking
they all sense something brewing
up the james and headed this way
bobby sips his morning coffee
says ` have you finished with the funnies ?
looks like a storm 's coming honey
guess we 'll have to stay in bed today '
i 've heard that into every life
a little of it must fall
"if there 's any truth to the saying ,"
"lord , let it be a southern rain"
"marie was born in macon , georgia"
she met a west coast lawyer
he plucked that sweet magnolia
and carried her to the hills of west l.a .
she says ` i never thought i 'd tire of
but this life has grown so hollow
every night there 's lipstick on his collar
and every morning i wash it away '
she heard that into every life
a little of it must fall
so she spends her evenings praying
for a little of that southern rain
cars alive on city streets
of sparkling black water
like waves beneath my window
never break just roll away
"tonight , this rain will be my lullaby"
"these cars , my dreams"
to carry me home to stay
the wipers beat a rhythm
truck spray obscures my vision
but i 'm closing in on my destination
two more hours and i 'll be at your door
and it will never cease to amaze me
how a little rain can drive folks crazy
when i 'd trade all my blue skies gladly
"for your blue eyes , crooked smile"
and a steady downpour
i 've heard that into every life
"a little of it must fall ,"
but you 'll never catch me complaining
about too much of that southern rain
if you 're trying to reach heaven
"you talk to jesus , you talk to him every"
"'cause jesus knows , he knows that you are coming"
and heaven 's just a prayer away .
"if you go , if you go to church on"
you get down on your knees and pray
and give your heart and your soul to jesus .
heaven 's just a prayer away .
you are just one prayer from heaven
as you travel down life 's highway .
just when you think that you ca n't make it
"well , heaven 's just a prayer away ."
"of , if you go , if you go to"
you get down on your knees and pray
and give your heart and give your soul to jesus
heaven 's just a prayer away .
heaven 's just a prayer away .

well i get lonely in a hurry if you left

there would be so many little teardrops fall i do
and i know a heart could never ache like mine
cause i get lonely in a hurry ...
[ guitar ]
if you ever took your love away from me i
i do n't think that i might live in memories
and for sure i know that i would lose my
if i could n't love you all the time
cause i get lonely in a hurry ...
i do n't think i could take it very long
love is so elusive but it 's worth the effort
awakening to feel a touch and taste the sweetness wo
so hold it gently in your hand or it might
yes love is so elusive that it wo n't return
love is like a soft caress a fevered kiss a
a whispered promise telling you that you 'll be leaving
a brief look at tomorrow like a dream or perhaps
though love is so elusive there 's not doubt about
so just reach out and touch it watch it grow
yes love is so elusive but it 's everything in
[ steel ]
love is like a little bird that seems to feel
searching for the arms to hold it tenderly and make
love is like the petals from a rose just a
yes love is so elusive but it 's most content
so just reach out and touch it watch it grow
yes love is so elusive but it 's everything in
we loaded up my old station wagon
"with a tent , coleman , and sleepin ' bags"
"some fishin ' poles , a cooler of cokes"
three days before we had to be back
"when you 're seven , you 're in seventh heaven"
when you 're goin ' campin ' in the wild
and as we turned off o that old dirt road
he looked at me and swore
"dad , this could be the best day of my"
i 've been dreamin ' day and night 'bout the
it 's just me and you doin ' what i
i 'm the luckiest boy alive
this is the best day of my life
"well , his fifteenth birthday rolled around"
classic cars were his thing
when i pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
i thought that boy would go insane
when you 're in your teens
your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
we worked nights on end 'til it was new again
"and as he sat behind the wheel , he said"
"dad , this could be the best day of my"
i 've been dreamin ' day and night 'bout the
it 's just me and you doin ' what i
i 'm the luckiest boy alive
this is the best day of my life
standin ' in a little room
back of the church with our tuxes on
lookin ' at him i say
"`` i ca n't believe , son , that you"
he said
"dad , this could be the best day of my"
i 've been dreamin ' day and night 'bout bein
now it 's me and her watchin ' you and
i 'm the luckiest man alive
this is the best day of my life
i 'm the luckiest man alive
no we ca n't control the evil that surround us
but as long as we 're together that 's enough
if there were just the two of us how different
no one could come between us from now on
the wagging tongues would speak no more the sounds of
without a prying ear to fall upon
no we ca n't control the evil that surround us
but as long as we 're together that 's enough
though we have no power over those around us
we can act as if there 's just the two
[ el.banjo - fiddle ]
though clouds of doubt may drift about upon a stormy
i 'll only draw you nearer onto me
as long as we 're together we 'll never walk
we 'll build a world of sunshine of our own
no we ca n't control the evil ...

sometimes when the night calls it a day
and i wake up down in this missing you kind
and i remember things better left forgotten
and sometimes when i 'm holding someone new
i ca n't help myself i slip off and think

why oh why wo n't my mind let go of
and though i try in my heart i know your
and sometimes right out of the blue i hear a
and i remember things better left forgotten
why oh why wo n't my mind let go ...
sometimes when the nights calls it a day
and i wake up down in this missing you kind

"he says , `` i 'm just a man ,"
but lately no work has been around
i wish that i could put more on the table
provide the life i 'm sure my family dreams about
`` but there 's cracks in all the walls and
"and the flies , they find their way in through"
i just pray that hope will go on living
in this house of a thousand dreams ''
"she says , `` my husband 's a good man"
gives all that he can
i know he thinks he 's let me down
i just want him and the children to be happy
"it 's not always easy , but it 's all"
`` so i 'll find some yard-sale curtains for the
and i 'll sew some yellow trim along the seams
and i 'll keep praying hope will go on living
in this house of a thousand dreams ''
"the boy says , `` my daddy 's a strong"
"my momma , she loves him"
and they love my brother and sister and me
sometimes at night we lay out in the backyard
and take turns wishing on the first star we see
`` and the crickets always sing outside the windows
and i love to feel the wind blow through the
and i sure hope that we can live forever
in this house of a thousand dreams ''
`` yeah i sure hope that we can live forever
in this house of a thousand dreams ''
"revenge must be the reason ,"
why forgiveness was a thing i never knew .
and someday soon i know you plan to hurt me
but do n't plan on getting by with the things
cause i 'll always know when you been cheating .
and i 'll always know you 've been untrue .
i 'll always know .
"your heart is like a window ,"
but when i look inside i see another man .
but go on and lie and tell him how you
but remember i saw through you 're evil plan .
cause i 'll always know when you been cheating .
and i 'll always know you 've been untrue .
i 'll always know .
and do n't forget it either .
funny thing about dreamers
when the dream is in their sights
just to get where they 're goin '
they leave a lot of good things behind
guess you could call me a dreamer
and i 've seen it all come true
so i smile when i need to look happy
and do all the things they tell me to
yeah i 'm a big self-made man
and a fool who ca n't understand
i thought i needed fortune
i thought i needed fame
but all i need is to hear you
whisper my name
if i could only make the future
an extension of my past
i 'd take these broken memories
and make those moments last
now that my ship has come
i wonder what have i done
i thought i needed fortune
i thought i needed fame
but all i need is to hear you
whisper my name
i thought i needed fortune
i thought i needed fame
but all i need is to hear you
whisper my name
oh yeah whisper baby
"just for the moment , we 'll become lovers"
"forget all our troubles , together again"
"just for the moment , once more we 'll discover"
"we still need each other , just for the moment"
"your hand in my hand , stirring up memories"
you always could get me with the flash of an
"but that ai n't the reason , we did n't"
we just could n't take it after a while .
"just for the moment , we 'll become lovers"
"forget all our troubles , together again"
"just for the moment , once more we 'll discover"
"we still need each other , just for the moment"
"love always changes , strangers to lovers"
"and lovers to strangers , when it comes to an"
"and all we could salvage , out of a fire"
"was our desire , a spark in the wind ."
"just for the moment , we 'll become lovers"
"forget all our troubles , together again"
"just for the moment , once more we 'll discover"
"we still need each other , just for the moment"
"we still need each other , just for the moment"
i knock off with a lot on my mind
from a long hard day
"pull in at home , see you and find"
my stress slipping away
then you run to my arms
and give me a kiss
and nothing else matters
when you hold me like this
"girl , i 'm in the mood to be your"
to win your heart all over again
"let my eyes trace , let my lips taste"
nothing but you
i 'm in the mood to close the door
make love tonight like never before
"rush after rush , like waves on the shore"
"girl , i 'm in the mood"
all day long i 'm so strong
then i hear you speak
"i 'm drawn to your fire , your signs of"
"girl , you make me weak"
i go drifting away
like a leaf in the wind
i 'm under a spell
your touch put me in
"girl , i 'm in the mood to be your"
to win your heart all over again
"let my eyes trace , let my lips taste"
nothing but you
"yeah , i 'm in the mood to close the"
make love tonight like never before

there 's no love left our love 's beyond help
why do we keep on tryin ' when there 's
the feeling we felt for each other for a long
we 'd both be better off without each other
we ca n't bring it back to life why do
there 's no love left ...
when love is gone it 's gone and you ca
when the warm sun goes down it turns cold
we both might as well just accept the fact there
hold
there 's no love left ...
there 's no love left ...
saint mother maria watch over us please
as we wonder around in this dangerous world
thank mother maria there 's nothing so sweet
as the undying love of a south texas girl
three in the front seat they sat on each side
that green-and-white 58 fairlane it would glide
down farm roads past open fields seeming like no big
as it was happening i never felt a thing
but now looking back it seems like it was everything
singing with mom just so we could hear ourselves sing
stealing a drink from the cold can in daddy 's
protected by only a small thin brown paper sack
and the wind blew the echoes of long-faded voices
and they 'd sing me a song that the old
and i did n't know what the words meant or
i was just singing because i was supposed to
sing mother maria watch over us please
as we wonder around in this dangerous world
thank mother maria there 's nothing so sweet
as the undying love of a south texas girl
and with the windows wide open it felt hot to
three bound together on a day just like any day
they told me and taught me and showed me and
whatever i wanted from the corner u-tote-m
they say the name corpus christi means the body of
pronounce it refugio city folks they do n't know
it looks like palacios but sounds like
just listen the next time you 're watchin ' sid
and the wind blew the echoes of long-faded voices
and they would sing me a song that the old
and i did n't know what the words meant or
i was just singing
saint mother maria watch over us please
as we wonder around in this dangerous world
thank mother maria there 's nothing so sweet
as the undying love of a south texas girl
and i did n't know what the words meant or
i was just singing
and these days with car seats and open container laws
social correctness leaves no room for santa claus
sitting right next to me she looks like that used
song that they sang for me
and with the windows wide open it feels hot to
two bound together on a day just like any day
the wind blows the echoes of long-faded voices
and they sing us a song that the old cowboys
and now that i know what the words mean and
i am still singing
saint mother maria watch over us please
as we wonder around in this dangerous world
thank mother maria there 's nothing so sweet
as the undying love of a south texas girl

if you want some good advice do n't let her
what is this thing you both have become that leaves
do n't walk away do n't run from yourself it
it 's not a rainbow you see through tears in
word that were spoken never to be broken to walk
then comes the doubt and all those greener pasture that
do n't walk away ...
[ steel - guitar ]
the earth is worn her sides are torn and tattered
they are as one and no devinely god believe in
do n't walk away ...
do n't think love is onesided
i ca n't eat and i ca n't sleep all
and listen for your footsteps at the door
i keep asking myself why we ever said goodbye
and i guess i shed a million tears or more
on my mind on my mind you 're always in
once i thought my love had died but darling here
you 're always in my heart and on my mind
[ fiddle - dobro ]
seems i miss you most of all when twilight shadows
what a fool i was to ever let you go
if longing for you now could only bring you back
you 'd be here in these lonely arms i know
on my mind on my mind ...
round like a circle in a spiral like a wheel
never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
like a snowball down a mountain or a carnival baloon
like a carousel that 's turning running rings around the
like a clock those hands are sweeping past the minutes
and the world is like an apple whirling silently in
like the circles that you find in the windmills of
like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of
down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has
like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten
or the ripples from a peble someone tosses in a
like a clock those hands ...
keys that jingle in your pocket words that jingle in
why did summer go so quickly was it something that
lovers walk along the shore and leave their footprints in
is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of
pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a
half remembered names and faces but to whom do they
when you knew what it was over you were suddenly
that the autumn leaves were turning to the color of
like a circle in a spiral ...
like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within
never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
as the images unwind like the circles that you find
when did you stop loving me
how long have i been a memory
i 've got to know for my own sanity
tell me when did you stop loving me
was it that night that you stayed out until dawn
you know that night has haunted me for so long
or was your love already cold
tell me please i 've got to know
"darling , when did you stop loving me"
there was a time when you worshiped where i stood
heaven knows i 'd bring it back if i could
i can tell when we make love
it aint me you 're thinking of
tell me when did you stop loving me
"darling , when did you stop loving me"

once my love was good enough
true happiness we knew
then fame and fortune came your way
and made a change in you
you 'll find your ladder of success
is not on solid ground
and when it starts to tumble
pick me up on your way down
pick me up when dreams are shattered
when false friends can not be found
for you know i 'll still be waiting
pick me up on your way down
"you 've hit the top , but it wo n't"
there 's just one way to go
the world you 've chosen is not real
these things you 'll come to know
when folks say they do n't know you
and you 've lost your final round
when you find that you are lonely
pick me up on your way down
was it wonderful for you
was it holly as it was for me
did you feel the hand of destiny
that was guiding us together
you were young enough to dream
and i was old enough
to learn something new
i 'm so glad
i got to dance with you
for a moment of forever
sometimes
when you 're cryin you 're happy
and sometimes you 're just cryin
"i know , i know"
and come whatever happens now
ai n't it nice to know
that dreams still come true
i 'm so glad
that i was close to you
for a moment of forever
( repete 3 estrofe )
i keep a close watch on this heart of mine
i keep the ends out for the ties that bind
i find it very very easy to be true i
yes i 'll admit that i 'm a fool for
[ guitar - steel ]
you 've got a way to keep me on your
for you i know i 'd even try to turn
as sure as night is dark and day is light
and happiness i 've known proves that it 's right

"ca n't help it , i 'm in love with"
"i got a track record , a past that 's"
as the floor at the diner on main street

little girl sorrow comes knocking at my door
i give her what i can but she always wants
and i want to borrow the future so it does
but i know it 's got ta hurt
grief stays outside your house until you let it in
sits down for tea and you tell it about where
"and it listens , and you feel"
"and it whispers , and you heal"
and suddenly it leaves you free
oh goliath guilt is hiding in my cupboard
she dresses me up in darkness till i 'm covered
"and i want to skip to forgiveness , disguise all"
but i 've got ta face it now
grief stays outside your house until you let it in
sits down for tea and you tell it about where

and suddenly it leaves you free
my friend peace is out there somewhere waiting
"sitting in sunlight , smiling ever patient"
and i want to tell her i 'm coming but
as soon as i let it go
today i sat alone at my window
and i watched our little girl outside at play
with the little boy next door like so many times
but something did n't seem quite right today
so i went outside to see what they were doing
and then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim
cause i heard him name a game and i hung
when i heard our little girl say to him
i do n't wan na play house i know it
i watched mommy and daddy and if that 's the
i do n't wan na play house it makes my
cause when she played house my daddy said goodbye
i do n't wan na play house ...

two streaks of steel stretchin ' cross the land too
i stood and watched her disappear and in the distance
tomorrow i 'll see coming down the track
that same old train that she ai n't coming back
for her sweet love that once was mine faded just
two streaks of steel i 've been standing beside
where all that mattered in my life just died
i want to lay across those tracks when that train
crossed those two streaks steel once again
two streaks of steel took my love away no reason
next time i 'll hear that whistle moan that all

a long time forgotten the dreams that just fell by
the good life he promised ai n't what she 's
but she never complains of bad times and the bad
she just talks about the good they 've had
and all the good times to come
she 's a good hearted woman in love with her
she loves him in spite of his wicked ways she
through teardrops and laughter
they 'll pass through this world hand in hand
this good hearted woman lovin ' her good timin '
he likes the bright lights the night life
and the good timin ' friends
and when the party 's all over she 'll welcome
lord she do n't understand but she does the very
she 's a good hearted woman lovin ' her good
i 'm so glad to have you back within these
i can finally go to sleep and get some rest
never once did i think of finding someone new
"'cause there 's nothing better , once you 've had"
you 're the very thing they sing about in love
and one mistake do n't mean you 've failed the
as i lay beside you softly sleeping this i know
"there 's nothing better , once you 've had the"
"within your arms , i 've had the best"
and i think the world should know
i do n't care what you 've said or done
i 'll always love you so
"you 've got more love in your little finger ,"
"and there 's nothing better , once you 've had"
"within your arms , i 've had the best"
and i think the world should know
i do n't care what you 've said or done
i 'll always love you so
"you 've got more love in your little finger ,"
"and there 's nothing better , once you 've had"
"no there 's nothing better , once you 've had"
i 've rehearsed this day a thousand times
i 've played this scene out in my mind
"you spread your wings , you need to fly"
it breaks my heart to say goodbye
these arms of mine wan na pull you close
but i love you enough to let you go
my mind goes back to memories
of pony rides upon my knee
"first day of school , your brand new bike"
and football games on friday nights
and through the years i 've watched you grow
and i love you enough to let you go
do n't look back when you drive away
i do n't wan na change your mind
i know in all your eighteen years
you 've never seen your daddy cry
so many things i wan na say
"you 'll meet new friends , you 'll be okay"
i 'll pray for you out on your own
but do n't forget your way back home
and though i may not let it show
i love you enough to let you go
do n't look back when you drive away
i do n't wan na change your mind
i know in all your eighteen years
you 've never seen your daddy cry
these arms of mine wan na pull you close
but i love you enough to let you go
"it 's sunday morning , the coffee 's on"
that gray cat 's still yawning
because saturday is gone
and i still feel the feeling
of how you felt upon me
and it may be no big deal to you
but it 's a very big deal to me
you were down and dirty
and he was tall and twenty nine
and i 'm only disconcerted
because you said you knew i would n't mind
but i still feel the feeling
of how you telephone me
and it may be no big deal to you
but it 's a very big deal to me
but you ca n't make a cool cat crazy
like you ca n't make a gray cat brown
and you ca n't keep a wild cat
when she knows the wildest cat 's in town
so it 's sunday morning
yeah and i guess i had it comin '
ooh 'cause i start recalling
a time i went astray
and i still feel the feeling
of her last words of warning
"she said , `` man , it may be no"
but it 's a very big deal to me ''
"she said , `` man , it may be no"
but it 's a very big deal to me ''
why did she have to go
so young i just do n't know why
things happen half the time
without reason without rhyme
"lovely , sweet young woman"
"daughter , wife and mother"
makes no sense to me
i just have to believe
she flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
by the clouds and stars and passed where no one
and she walks with jesus and her loved ones waiting
and i know she 's smiling saying
do n't worry 'bout me
loved ones she left behind
just trying to survive
and understand the why
feeling so lost inside
anger shot straight at god
then asking for his love
empty with disbelief
just hoping that maybe
she flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
by the clouds and stars and passed where no one
and she walks with jesus and her loved ones waiting
and i know she 's smiling saying
do n't worry 'bout me
it 's hard to say goodbye
her picture in my mind
they 'll always be of times i 'll cherish
and i wo n't cry 'cause
she flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
by the clouds and stars and passed where no one
and she walks with jesus and her loved ones waiting
and i know she 's smiling saying
do n't worry 'bout me
do n't worry 'bout me
i never liked the taste of whiskey
til i kissed it off of her lips
"never knew just what was hitting me , getting me"
"but there i sit , levi 's on a dogwood"
"yeah , she was taking me under"
i might have lost my innocence
but she was saving my soul that summer
i do n't know much about eternity
or where somebody like me 's gon na wind up
all i know is that i have already been
parked in a chevy by the deep river rolling
"and that summer night , shooting star paradise"
might be all that i 'm getting
kissing and sipping that seven and seven
somewhere just south of heaven
she might have been a fallen angel
"nah , i did n't care at all"
i never thought a prayer could be answered
"with a whispered , sweet southern drawl"
even now when i close my eyes
i see her silhouette dance on the river
the way we spent those endless nights
that 's the way i could spend forever
i do n't know much about eternity
or where somebody like me 's gon na wind up
all i know is that i have already been
parked in a chevy by the deep river rolling
"and that summer night , shooting star paradise"
might be all that i 'm getting
kissing and sipping that seven and seven
somewhere just south of heaven
somewhere just beyond the jericho line
"little white church , roll back through the pines"
down where the three cross river unwinds
"if there 's a heaven on earth , man that"
i do n't know much about eternity
or where somebody like me 's gon na wind up
all i know is that i have already been
parked in a chevy by the deep river rolling
"and that summer night , shooting star paradise"
might be all that i 'm getting
kissing and sipping that seven and seven
somewhere just south of heaven
"oh yeah , just south of heaven"
somewhere just beyond the jericho line
"little white church , roll back through the pines"
down where the three cross river unwinds
"if there 's a heaven on earth , man that"
"yeah , that 'd be mine"
"oh , just a little bit south of heaven ,"
no one will ever know my heart is breaking
although a million teardrops start to flow
i 'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
i 'll miss you but no one will ever know
i 'll tell them we grew tired of each other
and realized our dreams could never be
i 'll even make believe i never loved you
then no one will ever know the truth but me
no one will ever know how much i 'm pining
each time the past comes back to haunt me so
no one will ever see the tears i 'm hiding
you 've hurt me but no one will ever know
i 'll tell them i found true love with another
that i was glad the day you set me free
i 'll even make believe i never loved you
then no one will ever know the truth but me

donna on my mind when i get up in the
once i thought that no one girl could ever hold
once i thought that no one girl could ever hold
i gave two teeth in a teenage brawl
for a girl whose name i ca n't recall
then we broke up
i gave a knee to the football team
chasing that highschool state champ dream
we almost won
i gave junior college almost a year
then i gave a greyhound twenty bucks
and that 's how i got here
"i give all my money , for a slice of"
i give forty honest hours to a boss i never
and i gave my soul to jesus at the age
so there i n't much left to offer
but i give my heart to you
i gave a beard and a head of hair
to a boot camp corporal with a barber 's chair
at camp lejeune
i gave uncle sam what he bargained for
"twenty-four months , not a minute more"
i just did n't fit in
then i gave a highschool friend of mine a call
and we gave a body shop a try
'til we gave up last fall
"i do alright , most of the time"
"i 've learned to move on , i 've learned"
but sometimes i ca n't find the reason to be
so i leave a light on for your memory
i leave a light on for your memory
so it will be easy to come back to me
"when it 's late and i 'm alone , i"
i leave a light on for your memory
you found a new love and i 'd like to
that you 're really better off without me
the good days have slipped away but i sometimes dream
so i leave a light on for your memory
i leave a light on for your memory
so it will be easy to come back to me
"when it 's late and i 'm alone , i"
i leave a light on for your memory
"yeah , when it 's late and i 'm alone"
i leave a light on for your memory

and with the sweetest smile she 'd kiss the child
at the mill she 'd work her fingers till they

mary danced with soldiers
she stepped a light quadrille
shawl across her shoulders
"to keep away the chill , to keep away the"
it was a rebel boy who brought her joy they
though the years had passed the memories stood fast each
before a bullet crushed the life of their romance
he gave her a shawl and a parasol from france
mary danced with soldiers
she stepped a light quadrille
shawl across her shoulders
"to keep away the chill , to keep away the"
they came around to the tavern in town that night
and with silent cries mary never tried to fight
they cut her hair and left her body torn
her spirit slipped away before the dawn
mary danced with soldiers
but now her body 's still
shawl across her shoulders
to keep away the chill
mary danced with soldiers
she stepped a light quadrille
shawl across her shoulders
"to keep away the chill , to keep away the"
i knew a man called him sandy kane
few folks even knew his name
but a hero yes was he
"left a boy , came back a man"
still many just do n't understand
about the reasons we are free
i ca n't forget the look in his eyes
or the tears he cries
as he said these words to me
all gave some and some gave all
"and some stood through for the red , white and"
and some had to fall
and if you ever think of me
think of all your liberties and recall
some gave all
now sandy kane is no longer here
but his words are oh so clear
as they echo through out our land
for all his friends who gave us all
who stood the ground and took the fall
to help their fellow man
love your country and live with pride
and do n't forget those who died america ca n't
all gave some and some gave all
"and some stood through for the red , white and"
and some had to fall
and if you ever think of me
think of all your liberties and recall
some gave all
and if you ever think of me
"think of all your liberties and recall , yes recall"
some gave all
some gave all
there 's a picture that i carry one we made
when they ask who 's in the picture with me
just someone i used to spend some time with just
i do n't tell them how lost i am without
[ steel ]
just someone i used to run around with just a
i do n't tell them how lost i am without
i say just someone i used to know
there is a name i love to hear
i love to sing its worth
it sounds like music in my ear
the sweetest name on earth
"oh , how i love jesus"
"oh , how i love jesus"
"oh , how i love jesus"
because he first loved me
it tells me of a savior 's love
who died and set me free
it tells me of his precious blood
the sinner 's perfect plea
"oh , how i love jesus"
"oh , how i love jesus"
"oh , how i love jеsus"
because he first lovеd me
jesus first loved me
he tells of one whose loving heart
can feel my deepest woe
who in each sorrow bears a part
that none can bear below
"oh , how i love jesus"
"oh , how i love jesus"
"oh , how i love jesus"
"because he first loved me , yeah"
because he first loved me
she said if i ever deceive her
"she 'd be gone before i could count ten ,"
i guess that i did n't believe her ;
oh just look at the trouble i 'm in .
"gone , gone , gone , cryin ' wo n't"
"the more that i cry , the faster that plane"
father across the sky .
"well i lost every right to be happy ,"
well i lost all the heaven i found ;
she warned me she 'd leave and she left me
before my first tear hit the ground .
if i only knew where i could find her
well i 'd crawl there on my hands and knees
'cause each tick of the clock will remind her
that she 's one second farther from me .
{ instrumental }
farther across the sky .
i watched from my window as she slipped from the
"once again she 's leaving , but lord , she"
this morning a memory phoned her and he 's a
"so 'til she returns , i 'll wait for her"
looking out my window through the pain
the devil drove the taxi that carried her away
and it hurts to know she 's hung up on
once again she 's chasing memories and i 'm losing
"but i love her , so i 'll wait for"
looking out my window through the pain
i 'll pick up the pieces when he lets her
"with love and understanding , i 'll give her reasons"
and i 'll close my eyes pretending maybe someday she
"and i wo n't be left lonely ,"
looking out my window through the pain
"yes , the devil drove the taxi that carried her"
and it hurts to know she 's still hung up
once again she 's chasing memories and i 'm losing
"but lord i love her , so i 'll wait"
those city lights drew you like a magnet
you were attracted to his high-falootin ’ crowd
"i begged you not to go , but you still"
i ’ ve been expectin ’ you
"oh , look who ’ s back from town"
my old truck could not compare to his mercedes
did it humble you when you rode back on that
you picked a plastic rose and left a field of
i ’ ve been expectin ’ you
"oh , look who ’ s back from town"
what brings you back to this part of the country
"well let me guess , ol ’ loverboy let you"
did he throw you away like his money
i ’ ve been expectin ’ you
"oh , look who ’ s back from town"
i ’ ve been expectin ’ you
"oh , look who ’ s back from town"
she placed her ring on the sill
dishes piled high
she 's on the front porch step
and the air smells like snow
she 's thinking of the siege to come
and how she 'll miss those weekends in the park
"with the sun on her face , and her book"
and that lingering taste that he left on her tounge
he lifts his glass from the table
it leaves a ring where it stood
he sees a light from a window
caress her like he knows he should
he 's remembering the first time he kissed her
and how he 'd wake and immediately he 'd miss
"like a spell , with each breath"
he 'd taste her breath like a haunting
irritating as hell
do you remember when you prayed you 'd never see
someone would make you feel this way
'cause you knew it would cut right through you
"once inside , you were afraid they 'd find"
nothing to hold on to
he puts her ring on her finger
she brushes back his hair
he takes a sip from his glass
she inhales the cold fall air
they 're thinking of the long road ahead
and the strength that they 'll need just to reach
"and there in the silence , they search for the"
between this fear that they feel
and a love that has graced their lives
as we were dressing to go out our little girl
came in and asked if they could go this time
we told them little girls and boys do n't belong
and that they should be in bed asleep by nine
the babysitter came in then and we kissed the kids
and told them that we 'd be home soon and
then we left for the party like we 'd so
thinkin ' only of ourselves and not our little ones
the party started out wild and it grew wilder as
with drinking laughing teling dirty jokes nobody thinkin ' of
then the stranger feeling came over me and it chilled
and i told my wife that we 'd better leave
cause i felt that we were needed at home
as we rode along i got to thinking of how
had asked if we would take them to church the
and how i 'd put 'em off like i 'd
by sayin ' we 'd probably get home too late
then my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of sirens
as they cut through the still night air
then we turned down our street that 's when we
the rest was like a nightmare
we took their little bodies to church the next day
though we 'd left the party early we still got
"yeah , you and your friends , ten years old"
sneaking beech nut on back in the row
sell it at a market on saturdays
halloween getting lost with a girl in the maze
throwing cobs at the cars that are passing
sheriff comes out and you hide and you laugh
"you 're praying for the sun , praying for the"
praying over muffins that your grandma made
"corn in the truck , corn in the field"
corn in the bottom of a moonshine still
"corn in a kettle , corn in a skillet"
"corn in a jug , hot damn you can feel"
"corn for the chicken , corn for the deer"
corn for as far as you can see around here
leanin ' on a fence in a carhartt hat with
"sayin ' , `` man , look at all that"
"yeah , all that corn"
"yeah , it ai n't no wonder why you love"
you got your first kiss in a barn full of
"drank your first beer , lеarned to play guitar"
at a turnrow party with a tailgate bar
farmer 's daughtеr and a john deere man
"saving your money , put a ring on her hand"
now you 're raising more than a silver queen
in a little farmhouse by a field of dreams
"corn in the truck , corn in the field"
corn in the bottom of a moonshine still
"corn in a kettle , corn in a skillet"
"corn in a jug , hot damn you can feel"
"corn for the chicken , corn for the deer"
corn for as far as you can see around here
from the ohio river to the northern plat
"every highway , byway"
"hey , look at all that corn"
all that corn
"yeah , corn in a bag that you toss in"
corn on a hook at the end of a pole
corn popping up at the movie in a bucket
"first you got ta grow it , got ta pick"
"corn in the truck , corn in the field"
corn in the bottom of a moonshine still
"corn in a kettle , corn in a skillet"
"corn in a jug , hot damn you can feel"
"corn for the chicken , corn for the deer"
corn for as far as you can see around here
end this song the way it began
started with a c and end with a n
"corn , yeah , all that corn"
corn

i ai n't the kind you take home to mama
i ai n't the kind to wear no ring
somehow i always get stronger
when i 'm on my second drink
even though i hate to admit it
sometimes i smoke cigarettes
the christian folks say i should quit it
and i just smile and say `` god bless ''
cause i heard jesus he drank wine
and i bet we 'd get along just fine
he could calm a storm and heal the blind
and i bet he 'd understand a heart like mine
daddy cried when he saw my tattoo
but said he loved me anyway
my brother got the brains of the family
so i thought i 'd learn to sing
cause i heard jesus he drank wine
and i bet we 'd get along just fine
he could calm a storm and heal the blind
and i bet he 'd understand a heart like mine
and i 'll fly away from it all one day
"and i 'll fly , i 'll fly away"
but these are the days that i will remember
when my names called on a roll
he 'll meet me with two long stem glasses
and make a toast to me coming home
cause i heard jesus he drank wine
and i bet we 'd get along just fine
he could calm a storm and heal the blind
and i bet he 'd understand
understand a heart like mine
oh yes he would
it was painted red
it 's stripe was white
it was 18 feet
from the bow to the stern light
2nd hand from a dealer in atlanta
i rode up with daddy
when he went there to get it
put on a shine
put on a motor
built out of love
made for water
ran it for years
till the transom got rotton
a piece of my childhood that 'll never be forgotten
"it was , just an old plywood boat"
75 johnson with an electric choke
"a young boy , two hands on the wheel"
i cant replace the way it made me feel
"and i would turn it shore line , and ,"
"he 'd say , ya ca n't beat the way"
just a little lake across the alabama line
"but i was king of the ocean , when daddy"
"just an old 1/2 ton , short-bed ford"
"my uncle bought new , in '64"
daddy got it right
cause the engine was smokin '
couple burnt valves and he had it goin '
he 'd let me drive her when we 'd haul
"down a dirt strip , where we 'd dump trash"
off of thickpin road
i would sit on the seat
and stretch my feet out to the pedals
smiling like a hero that just received his medal
it was just an old hand-me-down ford
with a 3 speed on the column
a dent in the door
"a young boy , 2 hands on the wheel"
"i ca n't replace the way it , made me"
and i would press that clutch and i 'd keep
he 'd say a lil ' slower son you 're
just a dirt road with trash on each side
but i was mario andretti
when daddy let me drive
im grown up now 3 daughters of my own
i let 'em drive my old jeep
cross the pasture at our home
maybe one day they 'll reach back in their file
and pull out that old memory
"and think of me and smile , and say"
just an old worn out jeep
with rusty ole floor boards
and hot on my feet
"a young girl , two hands on the wheel"
"i ca n't replace the way it , made me"
"and he 'd say , turn it left now ,"
"straighten up girl now , you 're doin ' just"
just a lil ' valley by the river where we
"but i was high on a mountain , when daddy"
when daddy let me drive
when daddy lt me drive
oh he 'd let me drive
it was just an old plywood boat with a 75
"it 's bottles and bibs , rattles and cribs"
three am 's again and again
comfort the cry
"man , it 's flying by"
swings and slides and tricycle rides
skinning up knees and falling out of trees
it 's like it 's never gon na end
but it 's flying by
you better hold on tight to those little lives
in the blink of an eye it 's out of
"i know , i know to go so slow"
but it 's flying by
then it 's braces and boots and bad attitudes
boys and phones and every change in moods
"trying times , man , but you 'll survive"
and it 's supposed to be home at ten
you 're late again
where the heck you been
when you 're yelling and screaming
it do n't seem like it 's flying by
but it 's flying by
you better hold on tight to those changing lives
in the blink of an eye they 're out of
"i know , i know it seems so slow"
but it 's flying by
there they go on their own
flying by
you 're waving good bye with a tear in your
"i know , i know you go so slow but"
they come back home and what do you know
them kids have got some kids of their own
you ca n't believe how much they 've grown
and where the time 's gone
you look in the mirror there 's gray in your
you 're wondering how the world did that get there
it just ai n't fair how it 's flying by
"you better hold on tight to that sweet , sweet"
in the blink of an eye they 're out of
"i know , i know it goes so slow"
but it 's flying by
when it 's hospital beds
"last words said , did i do enough"
holding hands and being there for the leaving
it 's a line of cars parked on a hill
family and friends perfectly still
a prayer and a song as they lowered it down
"you better hold on tight it 's a short ,"
in the blink of an eye it 's out of
"i know , i know it seems so slow"
"yeah , it seems so slow but it 's flying"
it 's flying by
it 's flying by
it 's flying by

"slow down , you move too fast"

looking for fun and feelin ' groovy .
"hello lamppost , what cha knowing ?"
i 've come to watch your flowers growing

"doot-in ' doo-doo , feelin ' groovy ."
"got no deeds to do , no promises to keep"
i 'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
let the morning time drop all its petals on me
"life , i love you , all is groovy ...."

pulled down that cardboard box from the attic
the one with the letters from you
put on those old records while i was at it
the ones that we fell in love to
thought we were over what a crazy notion
i should have realized
i 'd lose the fight against this flood of emotion
welling up from deep inside
there 's not a dry eye in the house tonight
just a raging river of heartache and pride
there 's not a memory that does n't cut like
of me letting you just walk out of my life
every teardrop is a visible sign
of me missing you coming out
there 's not a dry eye in the house
every picture of when we were together
tear stained and falling apart
"chances i did n't take , regrets and mistakes"
i know them all by broken heart
there 's not a dry eye in the house tonight
just a raging river of heartache and pride
there 's not a memory that does n't cut like
of me letting you just walk out of my life
every teardrop is a visible sign
of me missing you coming out
there 's not a dry eye in the house
every picture of when we were together
tear stained and falling apart
"chances i did n't take , regrets and mistakes"
i know them all by broken heart
there 's not a dry eye in the house tonight
just a raging river of heartache and pride
there 's not a memory that does n't cut like
of me letting you just walk out of my life
every teardrop is a visible sign
of me missing you coming out
there 's not a dry eye in the house
every picture of when we were together
tear stained and falling apart
"chances i did n't take , regrets and mistakes"
every morning when you come down stairs
hair 's a mess but i do n't care
make-up on shining so bright
my old sweatshirt never fit so right
dancing around to the radio
humming the words that do n't know
cause i 'm finding an angel off my list
thinking that it do n't get no better than this
you make loving you easy
you make loving you all i wan na do
every little smile
every single touch
reminds me just how much it all makes
loving you easy
wrapped around me late at night
pillow talk by candlelight
gon na slow this down and make it last
best things fly by so fast
you make loving you easy
you make loving you all i wan na do
every little smile
and every single touch
reminds me just how much it all makes
( ohh i wan na sing it again )
you make loving you easy
you make loving you all i wan na do
every little smile
and every single touch
reminds me just how much it all makes
loving you easy
easy easy
my dad was a big man with a will that
he was at his best when the going was rough
he made a living for the family and never had
to keep food on the table and shoes on our
we sat down at the table and thanked god in
cause we had plenty to eat and plenty to wear
we had patches on our britches but momma kept us
we had food on the table and shoes on our
we picked the cotton and gathered the corn
we were taught to work from the day we were
mom and dad and all us children worked in the
to keep food on the table and shoes on our
when you sit down at the table thank god in
if you 've got plenty to eat and plenty to
if you 've got patches on your britches just be
if you 've got food on the table and shoes
have yourself a merry little christmas
let your heart be light
from now on our troubles will be out of sight
have yourself a merry little christmas
make the yuletide gay
from now on our troubles will be miles away
here we are as in olden days
happy golden days of yore
faithful friends who are dear to us
gather near to us once more
through the years we all will be together
if the fates allow
hang a shining star upon the highest bow
and have yourself a merry little christmas now
through the years we all will be together
if the fates allow
hang a shining star upon the highest bow
and have yourself a merry little christmas now
a merry little christmas

i did buy you a ring i believe it was
alright i admit it i forgot our anniversary
but i did pick up the baby this morning at
that ai n't no big thing but it 's gold
you get tired and disgusted with me
when i ca n't be just what you want me
i still love you and i try real hard
i swear one day you 'll have a brand new
i even asked the lord to try to help me
he looked down from heaven and said to tell you
just be patient i 'm a work in progress
i 'm sorry i got mad waiting in the truck
it seemed like hours you getting all dressed up
just to go to shoney 's on a wednesday night
i read that book you gave me about mars and
i think it 's sinking in but probably need to
but i 'm starting to see now what you 've
you get tired and disgusted with me
when i ca n't be just what you want me
i still love you and i try real hard
i swear one day you 'll have a brand new
i even asked the lord to try to help me
he looked down from heaven and said to tell you
just be patient i 'm a work in progress
i know you meant well when you bought me those
but my heels sure get hot down by the muffler
sure they 're stylish but i 'll take my boots
i try to do that healthy thing like you want
"but that low fat , no fat 's getting hard"
now i love your cooking honey
but sometimes i need some real food
you get tired and disgusted with me
when i ca n't be just what you want me
i still love you and i try real hard
i swear one day you 'll have a brand new
i even asked the lord to try to help me
he looked down from heaven and said to tell you

intro :
"if you need me , i 'll be gone"
the bed 's still warm where you just left
but it 'll be colder where i 've slept
i 've always been where you needed me
but i ai n't the fool i used to be
you come home all hours of the night
the fragrance on you ai n't old spice
tonight when you come draggin ' home
"and find you need me , i 'll be gone"
i 'll be gone like the moon when the sun
gone like the dew from the buttercup
gone like a woman treated wrong
"if you need me , i 'll be gone"
"so , what am i still doing here ?"
you 've been doin ' me wrong for years
tired of pickin ' up and puttin ' out
"i 'm leaving you lock , stock , and house"
"so , bye , bye , baby"
"that 's it , i 'm packed"
"i 'm a'leavin ' now , but i 'll call"
and leave this message on the code-a-phone
"sayin ' , if you need me , well ,"
i 'll be gone like the moon when the sun
gone like the dew from the buttercup
gone like a woman leavin ' home
"if you need me , i 'll be gone"
"i said , if you need me , i 'll"
tag :
"if you need me , i 'll be gone"
"i said , if you need me , i 'll"
i can hear that highway calling
as i watch the sunrise
crawling across her shoulder
this is usually goodbye
and yet those words
i just ca n't find here as i hold her
she 's like no other woman
that i have known before
and it ai n't me to see the morning sun
from this side of the door
why ai n't i running
why ai n't i gone
how does she hold me without holding on
in love or a fightm
she 's stronger than strong
something 's not right
if there ai n't nothing wrong
"it 's got me wondering , why ai n't i"
why ai n't i gone
all those words i left behind me
praying they would never
find me and my freedom
but if they stood right here beside me
they would never recognize me
for all that she 's done
once happiness was only
whenever i was on my own
so now why do i feel lonely
any time that i 'm alone
"no , they 've never built a wall that high"
or made a chain that strong
and god ai n't never made a place
i felt like i belong
i 've always heard people say it
but i guess i never fully understood it
"i thought that they meant , you 'd be easy"
but it 's drivin ’ me crazy
out of sight out of mind
"you opened my eyes , and now i can see"
"what you mean to me , i was so blind"
out of sight out of mind
you know it hurt when you left me
but i thought life would go on without you
"that was easier said , ca n't get you outta"
i do n't know if i 'll make it
out of sight out of mind
"you opened my eyes , and now i can see"
"what you mean to me , i was so blind"
out of sight out of mind
i was so blind
out of sight out of mind
today i started loving you again i 'm right back
i got over you just long enough to let my
and today i started loving you again
what a fool i was to think i could get

and that crying time for me had just begun
oh today i started loving you again ...
i got over you just long enough ...
come on hurry
ai n't no time for worrying
got ta go
move on
just leave the lights on
"grab some clothes ,"
set those sights on
that four-lane road
i 'm gone
"in a truck , in a train ,"
"in a car , in a bus ,"
"change my luck , ca n't stay"
"goin ' far , in a rush"
got that get away feeling

"yeah , i 'm leaving"
i walked out tonight for a ramble round
i did n't mean to stay just to view the
when i saw her smiling from afar
as she walked into that crossroads bar
well i walked inside and sat me down
ordered sweet red wine and i drank it down
she came and set beside me there
"with a dark brown eyes and the red , red"
i told her that i loved her true
anything you want i 'll surely do
said a man like you do n't get too far
with a girl like me at the crossroads bar
i like smoky light and a lonesome song
and i wo n't do right if i can do
you want the moon to burn behind the darkest star
and you wo n't find love at the crossroads bar
come all my friends and take my advice
keep your love at home with your lovely wife
you 're better off than you think you are
and you wo n't find love at the crossroads bar
why does the sun go on shining why does the
do n't they know it 's the end of the
why do the birds go on singing why do the
do n't they know it 's the end of the
i wake up in the morning and i wonder why
i ca n't understand no i ca n't understand how
why does my heart go on beating why do these
do n't they know it 's the end of the
why does my heart go on beating and why why
do n't they know it 's the end of the
"y'know , sometimes in our lives"

the more you try to put me down

like the weather your heart changes with each season
springtime summer fall and winter too
though i know i 'll never understand the reason
i still wonder why each season changes you
it was springtime when i found you like the flowers
and our love grew warmer with the summer sun
in the fall i could see our love was changing
it broke my heart to see what wintertime had done
like the weather your heart changes ...
came the spring again you said that you were sorry
and the summer brought a golden memory
in the fall i saw your love was changing
and the winter brought the same old misery
like the weather your heart changes ...
how do you fall in love
when do you say i do
when is the perfect time
to spend the rest of your life
seasons may come and go
and sometimes it rains and snows
and there will be highs and lows
so only you will know
you never know just where it will find you
'cause it can come on you so fast
seems like it takes forever
when you want it so bad
but do n't ever take it for granted
'cause it 's more than sowing some seeds
it takes sun and water
so give it what it needs
and that 's how you fall in love
that 's when you say i do
that 's when you know it 's time
to spend the rest of your life
now seasons may come and go
and sometimes it rains and snows
there will be highs and lows
so only you will know
there will be highs and lows
so only you will know

we 're just kids-seventeen again
do n't let anyone know
hold on tight and let 's just let it go
this ai n't just a kiss we 're stealing
let 's take our time and chase this feeling
nowhere to be and all night to get there
all night-breathing the same air
real close and real slow baby
just you and me and love laying right here

we can do anything i do n't care
we 've got nowhere to be and all
night to get there
secret hideaway
twilight choir in a serenade
the whole world 's spinning so fast
let 's jump off and let it roll right past
we can stay this way forever
getting gone-getting lost together
nowhere to be and all night to get there
all night-breathing the same air
real close and real slow baby
just you and me and love laying right here
sunset watching us disappear
we can do anything-i do n't care
we 've got nowhere to be and all
night to get there

ai n't never been my idea of gettin ' it
but the job demands that you make new plans
before your big chance is gone .
you get a house in the hills .
you 're payin ' everyone 's bills
and they tell you that you 're gon na go
"but in the back of my mind ,"
"i hear it time after time ,"
is that who you really are ?
"country boy , you got your feet in l.a. ,"
but your mind 's on tennessee .
"lookin ' back , i can remember the time"
when i sang my songs for free .
"country boy , you got your feet in l.a ."
take a look at everything you own .
"but now and then , my heart keeps goin '"
"talkin ' on the telephone ,"
settin ' up another day of people to meet .
"you 've got ta do what 's right ,"
"you 've got ta spend the night ,"
stayin ' in touch with the street .
"when you 're surrounded by friends ,"
"they say the fun never ends ,"
but i guess i 'll never figure it out
"'cause in the back of my mind ,"
"i hear it time after time ,"
is this what it 's all about ?
"country boy , you got your feet in l.a. ,"
but your mind 's on tennessee .
"lookin ' back , i can remember the time"
when i sang my songs for free .
"country boy , you got your feet in l.a ."

she captured both rock and bird
tied one to the leg of the other
kept them as prisoner
till they knew who was master
then she threw them to the sky
bird with unbarred wings disappeared
rock with weighted heart returned
and rock became her anchor
and bird became her dream
and now she stands on the forest floor
among the pines and towering firs
rock still firm beneath her feet
bird perched high above her
singing songs of love 's betrayal
i offered you my endless skies
you countered with hoods and chains
this song i sing will be the last
to be inspired by your memory
( craig bickhardt )
where i used to have a heart
feel like a mile wide ditch
i got a hole inside
the doctor just ca n't stitch
gone without a trace
you left a hollow place
there 's not a stone to mark
where i used to have a heart
there were times when i would
hold you
and feel the pounding in
by chest
now i 'm just as empty
as a canyon way out west
that 's how deep i love you
"babe , i love you still"
to the bottom of this space
i 'll never fill
i guess i 'll learn to live with
a different kind of pain
i 'm suffering from a sickness
that i can not give a name
such a strange sensation
i 've never felt before
missing you has cut me to the core
where i used to have a heart
way down in bowling green the prettiest girls i 've
a man in kentucky sure is lucky to love down
bowling green folks treat you kind better you think your
a man in kentucky sure is lucky in bowling green
kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold

a man in kentucky sure is lucky to lie down
[ strings - dobro ]
kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold ...
bowling green girls treat you right they wear dresses cut

it 's funny how love goes
cause i know this could never work out
"but honey , how love grows"
even though there 's no reason to doubt
this can never be
you keep saying it 's wrong
neither one of us is free
still i want to hold on
when even a fool would let go
cause he knows that there 's no use in trying
even a child would say no
when he knows that he 'll end up crying
"tell me now , is it wise holdin ' you"
even a fool would let go
love has no reason
like the words in a song that do n't rhyme
my love has no season
i just know that it 's there all the time
maybe just you and me
i ca n't believe that it 's wrong
thinking about you and me
just makes me want to hold on
"tell me now , is it wise holdin ' you"
when even a fool would let go
she may not be the girl that i 'll marry
but we still get together sometimes
i 'll admit i do n't like what she stands
but she loves me right out of my mind
i 'm looking for someone who 's gentle
and someone who 's so sweet and kind
but she sure feels devoid when i 'm lonesome
and she loves me right out of my mind
she never claimed to be an angel and an angel
but when we 're alone and i hold her she
when i look into her eyes i see a woman
and even if she 's not my kind
she 's got something i need so i 'll take
and let her love me right out of my mind
she 's the best thing the world has to offer
and she loves me right out of my mind
out of all the reindeers
you know you 're the mastermind

in the circles i 've been running
i 've covered many miles
but i could search forever
for what 's right before my eyes
just when i thought i found me
it was nothing like i planned
but when i got my heart around it
it slipped right though my hands
here with you i feel it
i close my eyes and see it
"in a midnight talk , in a morning kiss"
when i 'm in your arms
that 's where it is !
when we tangle up and ca n't resist
when we feel that rush
that 's where it is !
that 's where it is ..
when i 'm crashing though the madness
not sure who i 'm supposed to be
when i 'm caught up in the darkness
it 's you 're hand that 's leading me
you bring me back to solid ground
"you lift me up right here , right now !"
it 's a lifetime filled with tiny faces
the biggest things in the smallest places !
"in the sweetest smile , on a night like this"
with a tender touch
that 's where it is !
when we 're tangled up
and ca n't resist
when we feel that rush
that 's where it is !
that 's where it is ..
"i 've been telling you there 's someone else ,"

i was born and raised in alabama .
on a farm way back up in the woods .
i was so ragged folks used to call me patches

two days later papa passed away and i became a

though the years have passed and all the kids have
patches i tried to my best its up to you
"oh , i love her and just ca n't live"
and i 've got the urge to tell the world
but our love 's a secret and ca n't see
but i went and wrote this love song anyway
"her name is _ _ _ , her eyes are"
"her hair is just like _ _ , and she"
but someday i 'll fill in the lines when she
and we 'll walk in the sunshine _ _ _
-- - instrumental -- -
"oh , it really is a scandal and disgrace"
to have to call your woman what's-her-face
but her husband thinks he owns her heart and soul
and he 'll kill the man who messes with his
"her name is _ _ _ , her eyes are"
"her hair is just like _ _ , and she"
but someday i 'll fill in the lines when she
and we 'll walk in the sunshine _ _ _
"yes , someday i 'll fill in the lines when"
and we 'll walk in the sunshine _ _ _
her name is _ _ _ ...

without you here with me

and now that i 've found somebody new
you 've changed your tune
you want me back but all i can say

i 'd be your fool
and i would sit right here an ' wait
for you to make up
your mind to show up
"well , just turn around"
i 'm sorry it 's too late now

running down your cheek

lie just a little
pretend that you 're feeling a little more pain
i gave now i 'm wanting
something in return
so cry just a little for me
"if your love could be caged , honey"
i would hold the key
and conceal it underneath that pile of lies
you handed me
and you 'd hunt and those lies
they 'd be all you 'd ever find
and that 'd be all you 'd have to know
for me to be fine
and you 'd cry a little
you 'd die just a little
and baby i would feel just a little less pain
i gave now from wanting
something in return
so cry just a little for me
"give it up , baby"

the cold december wind seems bent on rockin ' new
the town that 's got me down to my last
"and everywhere i go , the people seem in such"
to keep this mobile girl from feelin ' fine
"lord , what i 'd give to see an alabama"
the sun just seemed to drop in mobile bay
new york town has got a gifted way to keep
"but that never was the mobile way , no ,"
that never was the mobile way
a flashing sign says that you can rent a bed
"in anybody 's town , that price is cheap"
it 's a shame to know a girl would ever
'cause i need ninety cents to go to sleep
i felt so big the day i left that mobile
i thought there had to be a better way
but if i could find that man that first called
that gentleman would surely learn to pray
"where there 's a cloud , do n't mean there"
"tears in my eyes , do n't mean there 's"
"do n't flatter yourself , i 'm over you"
things are n't always what they seem
you ca n't believe everythin ' you read
"on my face , i 'm over you"
you heard i 'm drinkin ' more than i should
that i ai n't been lookin ' all that good
someone told you i was takin ' it a rough
why they makin ' those stories up
when i 'm over you
there were times if you 'd been around
you 'd only see me broken down
"but now you wo n't , i 'm over you"
so if i seem a little bit cold
it only means you 've lost the hold
"you had on me , i 'm over you"
you heard i 'm drinkin ' more than i should
that i ai n't been lookin ' all that good
someone told you i was takin ' it a rough
but why they makin ' those stories up
when i 'm over you
you heard i 'm drinkin ' more than i should
that i ai n't been lookin ' all that good
someone told you i was takin ' it a rough
why they makin ' those stories up
when i 'm over you
yeah i 'm over you
i 'm over you
[ miley ]
ooooo
yeah
i did n't wan na listen to what you were
i thought that i knew all i need to know
i did n't realize that somewhere inside me
i knew you were right but i could n't say
"i can take care of myself , yeah , you"
i learned from you that i do not crumble
i learned that strength is something you choose
all of the reasons to keep on believin '
"there 's no question , that 's a lesson ,"
[ billy ray ]
we always do n't agree on
what is the best way
to get to the place that we 're going from
"but i can really trust you , and give you"
to make your decisions without any fear
[ both ]
i 'm grateful for all of the times
you opened my eyes
i learned from you that i do not crumble
i learned that strength is something you choose
"all of the reasons to keep on believin ' ,"
"there 's no question , that 's a lesson"
i learned from you
[ both ]
you taught me to stand on my own
[ miley ] and i thank you for that
[ both ]
"it saved me , it made me ,"
and now that i 'm looking back

"all of the reasons to keep on believin ' ,"
"there 's no question , that 's a lesson that"
[ miley ] yeah !
[ both ]
i learned from you
i can hear the wind a blowing in my mind
just the way it used to sound through the georgia
and you were there to answer
when i called you and me we had it all
remember how i used to touch your hair
while reaching for the feeling that was always there
you were the best thing in my life
i can recall you and me we had it all
i know that we can never live those times again
so i let my dreams take me back to where
then i 'll stay with you girl as long as
oh it was so good oh it was so good
oh it was so good when i was your man
i 'll never stop believing in your smile
even though you did n't stay it was all worth
you were the best thing in my life
i can recall you and me we had it all
you and me we had it all

"when the new wears off , i do n't even"
if you need me
i 'll be where my reputation do n't precede me
maybe i 'm addicted to goodbyes
"another vice , another town"
where my past ca n't run me down
"another life , another call"
another bed i should n't crawl out of
at 7 am with shoes in my hand
"said i would n't do it , but i did"
and i know i 'll be gone tomorrow night

it 's that five o'clock 500 every day
well the caution is out we 're at a stand-still
heard there 's construction up ahead

some trucker on the cb just said

"pick-up trucks , cars and buses all in my way"
"we 've got darrel , we 've got dale ,"
"richard , mark , rusty and jared"
oh the boss just dropped the green we 're on
"it 's that five o'clock 500 , five o'clock 500"
five o'clock 500 every day
there is no love and there is no hate there
i look at you and you look at me but
cause you do n't see me and i do n't
there is no love and there is no hate no
there 's no tiny hands to reach out to us
we have no tomorrow our future is gone there is
we do n't care enough to even ask questions
and when we 're together we still feel alone
there is no love and there is no hate no
there is nothing to look forward to no reason to
somewhere a river of happiness flows
we 'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes
somewhere there 's a garden where only love grows
somewhere a river of happiness flows
"dry your eyes , do n't cry no more"
we 'll find a place where there 's laughter and
so take my hand and do n't let go
come with me and together we 'll go
we 'll walk in the sunshine
we 'll laugh and we 'll sing
and dance to the tune that our happiness brings
come go with me to this place i speak of
"together , we 'll find it , this place is"
tag :
somewhere a river of happiness flows
there 's a lot of ways of saying what i
there 's songs and poems and promises and dreams that
but i wo n't talk of starry skies or moonlight
i 'll come right out and tell you i 'd
lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in
lay you down and tell you all the things a
i 'll let you know how much it means just
oh darlin ' how i 'd love to lay you
there 's so many ways your sweet love made this
you 've got a way of doing little things that
like standing in the kitchen in your faded cotton gown
with your hair still up in curlers i still love
lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in
lay you down and tell you all the things a
i 'll let you know how much it means just
oh darlin ' how i 'd love to lay you
when a whole lot of decembers are showin ' in
your auburn hair has faded and silver takes it 's
you 'll be just as lovely and i 'll still
and if i can i know that i 'd still
lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in
lay you down and tell you all the things a
i 'll let you know how much it means just
oh darlin ' how i 'd love to lay you
lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in
lay you down and tell you all the things a
i 'll let you know how much it means just
oh darlin ' how i 'd love to lay you
lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in
lay you down and tell you all the things a
i 'll let you know how much it means just
oh darlin ' how i 'd love to lay you
you say your heart 's been broken
and you just ca n't win
you say that you 'll never love again
let me tell you friend
you ca n't give up on love
that 's the one thing we 've got to keep
'cause it do n't come easy and it 's so
but you ca n't give up on love
looked out my window and what did i see
it 's another broken family
the kids are stayin ' with mama at home
daddy 's livin ' in a house all alone
you ca n't give up on love
that 's the one thing we 've got to keep
'cause it do n't come easy and it 's so
but you ca n't give up on love
troubled times make it hard to stay
so many lovers take the easy way
but do n't go crazy and jump ship too soon
'cause every day ca n't be a honeymoon
you ca n't give up on love
that 's the one thing we 've got to keep
'cause it do n't come easy and it 's so
but you ca n't give up on love
"no , you ca n't give up on love"
"oh , you ca n't give up on love"
dr. robert f. thomas
may his name forever stand
dr. robert f. thomas
"was a mighty , mighty man"
and he enriched the lives
of everyone that ever knew him
and in my song i hope to sing
some of the praise that 's due him
dr. thomas was a man
the lord must have appointed
to live among us mountain folks
in eastern tennessee
and he delivered more than half
the babies in those mountains
among those babies
he delivered me
there was no way to drive along
the roads back in those mountains
but dr. thomas got there
just the same
he often rode on horseback
to get where he was needed
but if he had to walk
he always came
dr. thomas was a friend
a neighbor and a doctor
though he seldom got a dime
for all he 'd done
and i remember lots of times
we sent for dr. thomas
but i do n't recall a time
he did n't come
they say a man is judged
by the deeds he does while livin '
a judgement when he stands
before the lord
and i know heaven holds a place
for men like dr. thomas
and i know that he 'll receive
his just reward
i 'm looking at a star
wondering where you are
lonely in love
looking at the sky
start to wonder my love
how long i 'm going to burn
with this same old flame
i miss you all the time
ai n't unhappy
but i 'm lonely in love
i know i did n't treat you right
scared you into flight
lonely in love
never acted wise
could n't organize love
but these longings return
when i hear your name
i let you go and now
i ca n't forget somehow
i 'm lonely in love
i 'm young in the daylight
with a pocket full of money
ladies to the left
and to the right
but when night time comes
i 'm a star watcher honey
i ca n't get along
on light bulb light
so i 'm looking at a star
wondering where you are
lonely in love
looking at the sky
start to wonder my love
how long i 'm going to play
in this rained out game
it do n't make any sense
but honey be convinced
i 'm lonely in love
if you think i 've second guessed it
or for one minute i 'd regret it
this life with you
"no , there 's never been a moment"
not one time i have n't known it
what i have with you
you hold my heart
deep inside of every single part
if i could be anything
"i wish that i could be , oh baby"
if i could rule all the kingdoms
maybe even sail the seven seas
if i could do all the things
i only dream that i could do
i 'd still be
the man in love with you
i try every day to show it
just to make sure that you know it
i 'm here to stay
and you 'll never have a reason
to ever think i 'm leaving
there 's just no way
it 's no mystery
how i feel
"baby , ca n't you see"
i ca n't go places
i always see traces
of the only thing in life i 'll ever need
if i could do all the things
i only dream that i could do
i 'd still be
the man in love with you
i 'd still be
the man in love with you
"writers charles l. seitz , joe lewis , elmar rader"
i thought i had seen pretty girls in my time
i never saw one that i wanted for mine that
i thought i was swinging the world by the tail
i thought i 'd been kissed and i thought i
met you
i thought i 'd stay single and always be free
and i said that no sweet thing could ever hold
i thought i was swinging ...
i thought i was swinging ...
that was before i met you
everybody waitin ' for the weekend
gettin ' off five in the p. m
wan na blow off a little steam and
go cut a-loose somewhere
folks start showin ' up at seven
order up a crown or a cold one
nobody buyin ' rounds for no one
no girls dancin ' on the bar in there
but in the a. m
they go from gettin ' buzzed into wasted
might not remember what they 're sayin '
radio turned up and playin ' loud a honky tonk
spendin ' what they spent the week makin '
ask a little hottie what her name is
the whole worlds a-sleepin '
we 're wide awake in the a. m
leave around ten and you 're alright
"everybody 's cool , never uptight"
but if you stay longer than midnight
you might end up in the middle of a fist
cause in the a. m
they go from gettin ' buzzed into wasted
might not remember what they 're sayin '
radio turned up and playin ' loud a honky tonk
spendin ' what ya spent the week makin '
ask a little hottie what her name is
the whole world 's a-sleepin
we 're wide awake in the a. m

spendin ' what ya spent the week makin '
ask a little hottie what her name is
"hey baby , tell me , what ya think about"
let me show you my chevrolet and
we can sit and do a little star-gazin '
get a little bit of a long time in

"ay-yeah , in the a. m"
ha !
sing the wondrous love of jesus ;
sing his mercy and his grace .
in the mansions bright and blessed
he 'll prepare for us a place .
[ refrain : ]
"when we all get to heaven ,"
what a day of rejoicing that will be !
"when we all see jesus ,"
we 'll sing and shout the victory !
onward to the prize before us !
soon his beauty we 'll behold ;
soon the pearly gates will open ;
we shall tread the streets of gold .
[ refrain ]
i 'm crazy
crazy for feeling so lonely
i 'm crazy
crazy for feeling so blue
i know
you 'd love me as long as you wanted
then someday
leave me for somebody new
worry
why do i let myself worry
wondring
what in the world did i do
crazy
for thinking that my love could hold you
i 'm crazy for trying
i 'm crazy for crying
i 'm crazy for loving you
i lost my mind the day i lost your love
i lost everything except the will to cry
if you find me crawling back from time to time
"it 's not you i want , i 'm lookin"
'cause i lost my mind the day i lost your
i 'm not crazy but sometimes i wish i was
if you turn around and find me crawling close behind
"it 's not you i want , i 'm lookin"
'cause i lost my mind the day i lost your
i 'm not crazy but sometimes i wish i was
if you turn around and find me crawling close behind
"it 's not you i want , i 'm lookin"
"it 's not you i want , i 'm lookin"

you 're standing much too close to me again
i 've never once touched you but in my mind
you 're making it hard for me to be true
seems like every place i go i 'll see you
i ca n't keep my eyes off you i just
you tempt me more than anyone i ever knew i
i do n't trust me around you i belong to
but when i 'm close to you this way i
i do n't trust me around you
i do n't trust me ...
no i do n't trust me around you
was it that long ago
i was skipping school with a lunchbox
pigtails in my hair
where did the time go
one minute i 'm playing in the sandbox
how 'd i get to here from there
making lunches and folding clothes
it 's not the most glamourous life i know
but i 've got so much more than most
i 'm not famous but my kids think i 'm
im not rich but i 've made a million memories
i may not be a model
but my man thinks i could be
i may not be from royalty
but in these four walls
i 'm the queen
i had it all planned
first i 'd make it big in nashville
then take hollywood by storm
but it was in god 's hands
there were three little lives that would need me
to one day be their mom
i would n't trade it for anything
those movie stars do n't have everything
i know i 'm right where i wan na be
"i had to let it go , but i have"
i would have never known this kind of happiness
front porch light would be turned on
and i was always gone too long
curfew was at 10pm
and i 'd sneak in trying not to wake him
home
daddy always said son your half a bubble off plumb
"head-strong and stubborn , and maybe i was"
"yeah , i could n't wait to leave"
last place in the world i wanted to be was
home
now i 'm flying down that old dirt road
but it seems these wheels are spinning slow
i 'd never left that way if i 'd have
"but he 's gone , so here i am"
home
i sat in my car and cried
wished to god he was still alive
"inside , mama wiped my tears"
"she said , he would have been so happy that"
at home
then i thought about my life
and about my kids and about my wife
and about how time just flies no matter what you
and every soccer game i have missed
and every time i fight when i could forgive
and how i ca n't let it come to this
when i get home
now i 'm flying down that old dirt road
but it seems these wheels are spinning slow
and it 's taken me awhile but now i finally
everything that matters most is at
home
why does the sun go on shining ?
why does the sea rush to shore ?
do n't they know it 's the end of the
'cause you do n't love me anymore ...
why do the birds go on singing ?
why do the stars glow above ?
do n't they know its the end of the world
it ended when i lost your love .....
"i wake up in the morning and i wonder ,"
why everything 's the same as it was .....
"i ca n't understand , no- i ca n't understand"
how life goes on the way it does ....
why does my heart go on beating ?
why do these eyes of mine cry ?
do n't they know it 's the end of the
it ended when you said : good bye .
why does my heart go on beating ?
why do these eyes of mine cry ?
do n't they know it 's the end of the
it ended when you said : good-bye ........
everybody wants to find a love
"somebody , somebody who will always care"
we get locked up in our own worlds
with feelings and secrets we 're afraid to share
but all i have to do is see you smile
"and maybe , just maybe if i brush your hand"
something happens i can not explain
"and somehow , oh somehow i can understand"
"i , i think you 're gon na find"
gon na find you
gon na find you
i 'm reading your mind
i know you by heart
and you 're so much a part of me
"i know you by heart , yes i do"
it 's no wonder i can love you the way
i can finish any sentence you start
"i know you , i know you by heart"
i know everytime you 're gon na call
i pick up the phone before it ever rings
and when you need some lovin ' i 'll be
beside you anticipating everything
oh it 's like i always said
you 're the one i want
all i want is you
i 'm inside your head
i know you by heart
"girl , you 're so much a part of me"
"i know you by heart , yes i do"
it 's no wonder i can love you the way
i can finish any sentence you start
"i know you , i know you by heart"
it 's no wonder i can love you the way
i can finish any sentence you start
"i know you , i know you by heart"
i know you by heart
and you 're so much a part of me
"i know you by heart , i know you ,"
it 's no wonder i can love you the way
i can finish any sentence you start
"i know you , i know you by"
tonight down here in the valley i 'm lonesome and
as i sit here alone in my cabin i can
do you recall when we parted the story to me
you said you could live without love dear in your
[ fiddle ]
i 've waited all through the years love to give
cause i know you 're living in sorrow in your
the light shines bright from your window the trees stand
and i know you 're alone with your pride dear
( stephanie davis )
in waters calm i sailed from shore
to see what i might see
and having never sailed before
i drifted aimlessly
a warm breeze rocked my boat until
in slumber i fell sound
but woke to find the light grown dim
and dark clouds gathering 'round
in haste i worked at turning back
but now the wind blew wrong
and when the night came cold and black
my strength was almost gone
but with one last small thread of hope
i bowed my head to pray
then through the dark i saw a rope
and heard a calm voice say
grab the rope
hold it tight
in the distance
shines a light
neither fear
nor feel alone
there is one
who 'll lead you home
i heard my heart beat loud and fast
but did as i was told
and with the rosey dawn at last
dry land i did behold
i kissed the sandy banks and swore
my sailing days were through
but should i ever stray from shore
i know now what to do
grab the rope
hold it tight
in the distance
shines a light
neither fear
nor feel alone
there is one
who 'll lead you home
grab the rope
hold it tight
in the distance
shines a light
neither fear
nor feel alone
there is one
saw your picture in the paper and i see you
and i know that he can give you all the
but i know that he ca n't give you what
so the door is always open and the light 's
yes the door is always open and the light 's
and you know that i 'll be waiting if you
[ guitar ]
when night falls on that mansion and you 're lying
when he begs for your attention will you think of
when he reaches out to touch you is your face
well the door is always open and the light 's
yes the door is always open ...
"well when i woke up this mornin ' ,"
"there was a note upon my door ,"
"said do n't make me no coffee babe ,"
"'cause i wo n't be back no more ,"
"and that 's all she wrote , dear john ,"
i 've sent your saddle home .
now jonah got along in the belly of the whale
"daniel in the lion 's den ,"

love i have n't seen you in a long time
since then i ai n't been worth a dime
has n't been that long
but it feels like years
last time it could have worked out better
but you know we belong together
love do n't be a stranger round here
you know your way around my heart
but i know you do n't see well in the
so i leave a light on and you wo n't
in the morning or even at midnight
you can come on in its all right
love do n't be a stranger
do n't worry bout the danger
love do n't be a stranger round here
last time you went away
"you made me cry , cry , cry"
said i did n't need you anyway
"but i lied , lied , lied"
love do n't be a stranger
do n't worry bout the danger
love do n't be a stranger round here
love i 'm a little bit smarter
and i 'll try a little bit
this time i wo n't wind up in tears
love now that we 're talking
maybe you 'll come around more often
love do n't be a stranger
do n't worry about the danger

last time you went away
"you made me cry , cry , cry"
said i did n't need you anyway
"but i lied , lied , lied"
love do n't be a stranger
do n't worry bout the danger
well it must 've been 100 in that summer sun
and i 've been in it all day
putting up with that prick of an owner 's son
making me some hillbilly pay
"working right through lunch , busting my hump"
helping his daddy stay rich
so when he kept me behind to pull some overtime
i told that little son of a bitch
"hey i 've been punching your clock , giving all"
putting up with your pain in the rear
"adios , i 'm done , you can find me"
between a hottie and an ice cold beer
hey i 've been breaking my hump but it 's
ai n't a part of me that does n't hurt
hey but lucky for me you can easily see
i still got a finger that works
yea i 've been dragging home almost every night
'bout the time that you 're going out
wearing something way too short and tight
leaving me and the dog on a couch
"yea , now word 's getting round you 've been"
dancing way too risky
well i got a few dirty dance moves too
and a cute little one finger wave
"hey i 've been punching your clock , giving all"
putting up with your pain in the rear
"adios , i 'm done , you can find me"
between a hottie and an ice cold beer
hey i 've been breaking my hump but it 's
ai n't a part of me that does n't hurt
hey but lucky for me you can easily see
i still got a finger that works
here it comes
"hey i 've been punching your clock , giving all"
putting up with your pain in the rear
"adios , i 'm done , you can find me"
between a hottie and an ice cold beer
"hey i 've been busting my ass , you do"
ai n't a part of me that does n't hurt
hey but lucky for me you can easily see
i still got a finger that works
oh yea
woo !
yes i do
look at that thing
"you know you 're number one , baby"
you must 've a been in a place so dark
reachin ' for you through that stormy cloud
now here we are gathered in our little home town
this ca n't be the way you meant to draw
"oh why , that 's what i keep askin '"
was there anything i could have said or done
"oh i , had no clue you were masking a"
"what went wrong , and why you 'd leave the"
now in my mind i keep you frozen as a
roundin ' third to score that winning run
you always played with passion no matter what the game
when you took the stage you shined just like the
"oh why , that 's what i keep askin '"
was there anything i could have said or done
"oh i , had no clue you were masking a"
"what went wrong , and why you 'd leave the"
"yeah , yeah , yeah"
now the oak trees are swayin ' in the early
the golden sun is shining on my face
the tangled thoughts i hear a mockingbird sing
this old world really ai n't that bad a place
oh why there 's no comprehending
and who am i to try to judge or explain
"oh , but i do have one burning question"
who told you life was n't worth the fight
they were wrong
they lied
and now you 're gone
and we cried
"'cause it 's not like you , to walk away"
your beautiful song
your absolutely beautiful song
the bottle is almost empty the clock just now struck
darling i had to call you to our favorite place
we know it 's wrong for us to meet
but the fire 's gone out at home
there 's nothing cold as ashes after the fire is
"love is where you find it , when you find"
"and there 's nothing cold as ashes , after the"
your lips are warm and tender your arms hold me
sweet words of love you remember
that the one at home forgot
each time we say it 's last time but we
and there 's nothing cold as ashes after the fire
"love is where you find it , when you find"
"and there 's nothing cold as ashes , after the"
"and there 's nothing cold as ashes , after the"
words and music by randy owen
whisper to me softly three words upon my skin .
"no one 's near and listenin ' , so please"
just hold me close and love me .
press your lips to mine .
"mm , feels so right , feels so right ."
"lying here beside you , i hear the echoes of"
promise me you 'll stay with me and keep warm
so hold me close and love me .
give my heart a smile .
"mm , feels so right , feels so right ."
your body feels so gentle and my passion rises high
you 're lovin me so easy .
your wish is my command .
just hold me close and love me .
tell me it wo n't end .
"mm , feels so right , feels so right ,"
"aw , you feel so right baby ."
"the stillness here ,"
"like what he sometimes finds inside her ,"
hits so hard it can steal your breath forever .
he sometimes wonders
is the sum of their lives together
him on the floor and her lost to a mind
these days he 's drinking for the pleasure of falling
and he 's falling for the pleasure of pretending
that she 's sitting by the window waiting
for him to come calling .
if i could fix me up a week of twilight
we 'd sit on the point
and watch the sun continually flounder .
bathed in gold we 'd plug into some kind of
and connect with those days
back before all of this went sour .
'cause i 'm drinking for the pleasure of falling
and i 'm falling for the pleasure of pretending
that you 're sitting by the window waiting
for me to come calling .
odd how the darkness always makes us whisper
and with the last of the sun
you can feel the approach of the winter .
now is the time of each day that i
desperately miss her .
i suppose i will learn how to live my life
so you 're drinking for the pleasure of falling
and you 're falling for the pleasure of pretending
that i 'm sitting by the window waiting
for you to come calling .
"i wo n't lie , it hurts like hell"
"so i 'm doing shots , just trying to deal"
"with all this pain , she left me with"
so i 'm getting gone so i can get
blacked out
like elvis in 1968
like johnny cash any given day
like a mach 1 fastback mustang
i 'm blacked out like the clouds hanging over this
these ray-ban 's covering up my eyes
"not a shadow of a doubt , blacked out"
her goodbye rattles around
just like a ghost in this house
"that 's why i drink , to drown it out"
it 's the only way i know to let her
blacked out
like elvis in 1968
like johnny cash any given day
like a mach 1 fastback mustang
i 'm blacked out like the clouds hanging over this
these ray-ban 's covering up my eyes
"not a shadow of a doubt , blacked out"
blacked out
like that label on the bottle of jack
the old guitar emmylou has
like the coal at the bottom of an old mine
blacked out
like the clouds hanging over this heart of mine
these ray-ban 's covering up my eyes
not a shadow of a doubt
"no , there 's not a shadow of a doubt"
blacked out
blacked out
let me tell you bout a guy i know she
every morning fore the sun comes up he brings my
that 's why i know yes i know hallelujah i
when i 'm in trouble and i have no friends
everybody asks me how i know i smile at them
that 's why i know yes i know hallelujah i
when i call him on the telephone and tell him
by the time i count from one to four i
in the evening when the sun goes down when there
he kisses me and he holds me tight and tells
that 's why i know yes i know hallelujah i
[ sax ]
when i call him on the telephone ...
you came into my life like an answer to a
like a star that falls from the sky right out
some might say itâ€™s a miracle or a dream come
but from that day i always knew
heaven is missing an angel
thatâ€™s the only thing that it can be
heaven is missing an angel
â€˜cause youâ€™re right here with me
no one else in the world has touched me like
"itâ€™s super natural , girl , the way i feel"
iâ€™m in paradise whenever youâ€™re around
then when i look in your eyes thereâ€™s no doubt
heaven is missing an angel
thatâ€™s the only thing that it can be
heaven is missing an angel
â€˜cause youâ€™re right here with me
iâ€™m in paradise whenever youâ€™re around

but just remember i 'll be here
to keep your heart with me until you see

"it 's almost midnight ,"
an time to go downstairs and go to work
"i wonder how he 's doin ' in , tennessee"
( g.j . ) spoken :
"well , here i sit by the window"
of this big old lonely mansion
lookin ' out over the smokies
and on in everything i can see
"oh , i guess by now she 's found"
what she was lookin ' for
and as i look at this old faded photograph
of the girl that i still love
"i wonder if she ever , thinks of me"
( both )
but the weather 's good
i 've been living a new way of life that
but i can see the clouds are gathering and the
for last night he hugged you tightly and you did
this is true for i 've been watching from the

he left his dead in the cottonwood trees
the ground grown too hard with the years
falling down was not what it used to be
the ground grown too hard with the years
he told his children those little white lies
the truth would only paralyze them
he told himself those little white lies
the truth would only paralyze him
"lay it down , lay it down"
"he sold most of what he cherished ,"
the rest he let them steal
"shot his dog out in the open field ,"
the rest he let them steal
"he broke all of his promises ,"
under a sea green sky
"they never thought to ask him why ,"
under a sea green sky
"lay it down , lay it down"
please bury me in the cottonwood trees
the ground grown too cold for me
going to sleep tonight in a warm feather bed
the ground grown too cold for me
"lay it down , lay it down"
lots of ladies look at me
with want to in their eyes
but each time they do
i think of you and it makes me realize
cause an old love won ’ t do
any old love won ’ t do
any old love won ’ t do
i don ’ t want to love
if it isn ’ t with you
any old love won ’ t do
you ’ ve got the only arms
i ’ ve ever come runnin ’ to
love has always led me to your bed
just any old love won ’ t do
i could spend forever
any never want nobody new
"with you by my side , i ’ m satisfied"
just any old love won ’ t do
what are we doing in this place alone is our
true love we knew in the past is gone but
let 's go home before our weakness gets too strong
long ago we let the flame of love burn out
now we have no reason to reach for love that
if we live our past in the present our future
let 's go home before our weakness gets too strong
[ fiddle ]
line with temptation we raced into the past
on a road too small to let the past and
are we going too fast to turn back and leave
let 's go home before our weakness gets too strong
long ago we let the flame ...
let 's go home before our weakness gets too strong

over my left shoulder
i 've spent most all my life
searchin ' for that four-leaf clover
"yet , you ran with me"
chasin ' my rainbows
"and honey , i love you , too"
that 's the way love goes
"that 's the way love goes , babe"
that 's the music god made
for all the world to sing
"it 's never old , it grows"
losin ' makes me sorry
"you say , `` honey , do n't worry ''"

about best friends
john roy
was a boy i knew
since he was three
and i was two
grew up two little houses
down from me
the only two bad apples
on our family tree
kind of ripened and rotted
in our puberty
two kindred spirits bound by destiny
well now i was smart
but i lacked ambition
johnny was wild
with no inhibition
was about like mixin
fire and gasoline
( and he 'd say )
hey romeo
let 's go down to mexico
chase senoritas
drink ourselves silly
show them mexican girls
a couple of real hillbillies
got a pocket full of cash
and that old ford truck
a fuzzy cat hangin
from the mirror for luck
said do n't you know
all those little
brown-eyed girls
want playboys of the southwestern world
long around
our eighteenth year
we found two plane tickets
the hell out of here
got scholarships
to some small town
school in texas
learned to drink sangria
til the dawns early light
eat eggs ranchero
and throw up all night
and tell those daddy 's girls
we were majoring in a rodeo
ah but my
favorite memory
at school that fall
was the night john roy
came runnin down the hall
wearin nothin
but cowboy boots
and a big sombrero
( and he was yellin )
hey romeo
let 's go down to mexico
chase senoritas
drink ourselves silly
show them mexican girls
a couple of real hillbillies
got a pocket full of cash
and that old ford truck
a fuzzy cat hangin
from the mirror for luck
said do n't you know
all those little
brown-eyed girls
want playboys of the southwestern world
and i said
we had a little
change in plans
like when paul mccartney
got busted in japan
and i said
we got waylaid
when we laid foot
on mexican soil
see the boarder guard
with the fu manchu mustache
kind of stumbled on john 's
pocket full of american cash
he said
doin a little funny business
in mexico amigo
but all i could think about
was savin my own tail
when he mentioned ten years
in a mexican jail
so i pointed to john roy and said
it 's all his now please let me go
well it was your idea genius
i was just layin there in bed
when you said
hey romeo
let 's go down to mexico
chase senoritas
drink ourselves silly
show them mexican girls
a couple of real hillbillies
got a pocket full of cash
and that old ford truck
a fuzzy cat hangin
from the mirror for luck
said do n't you know
all those little
brown-eyed girls
want playboys of the southwestern world
ah we 're still best friends
temporary cell mates
when loving turns to parting
i 'm always the first to leave
cause when it comes to heartaches
i 'd rather give than to receive
i 've never cried myself to sleep
just praying i 'll get through
i 've never lost at love not counting you
not counting you i 've never had a heartache
not counting you i never have been blue
there 's no exceptions to the rule
i 've never been nobody 's fool
i 've never lost at love not counting you
i 've never got down on my knees
and asked the lord above
if he would only bring to me
the one i 'm dreaming of
begging to be taken back
and swearing i 'll be true
has never crossed my mind not counting you
there 's no exceptions to the rule
i 've never been nobody 's fool
i 've never lost at love not counting you
there 's no exceptions to the rule
i 've never been nobody 's fool
i 've never lost at love not counting you
"no , i 've never lost at love not counting"
if i did n't care more than words can say
if i did n't care would i feel this way
if this is n't love then why do i thrill
and what makes my head go round and round
while my heart stands still
if i did n't care would it be the same
would my every prayer begin and end with just your
and would i be sure that this is love beyond
would all this be true if i did n't care
[ sax ]
and would i be sure that this ...

i 'm about to take this 4 wheel drive and
i 've had fame and fortune
women come knock on my door
i 've live to the limit maybe a little bit
there are so many stories of how i got out
some say it 's a woman
some say it 's my trouble soul
i 'm like a crazy old soldier
fightin ' a war on my own
just me and the whiskey
and the bottles are ten thousand strong
you 'd think i 'd give up
as many times as i 've been hit
but like a crazy old soldier
i just do n't know when to quit
barrooms and bedrooms
are just faces and places and names
once for the pleasure
and lord knows once for the pain
i 've tried to forget her
and all of the things that we 've done
but as long as there are memories
i 'll never hang up my gun
i 'm like a crazy old solider
fightin ' a war on my own
just me and the whiskey
and the bottles are ten thousand strong
you 'd think i 'd give up
as many times as i 've been hit
but like crazy old solider
i just do n't know when to quit
like a crazy old solider
i just do n't know when to quit
by jpr
i had to look through our old pictures
to see the way we used to smile
before we left love in the closet
like it just went out of style
can we pull out those old feelin 's
wipe the hurt away like dust
make love shine the way it used to shine
find the gold beneath the rust
that 's all i need to know
do you wan na stay together
just say let 's do n't let go
and i 'll keep holdin ' on forever
have the teardrops that you 've cried
drowned the fire in your eyes
is there one flame beneath the smoke
tell me is there any hope
that 's all i need to know
is it too late to recover
those old smiles we used to wear
can we save a love that once was strong
before it breaks beyond repair
that 's all i need to know
do you wan na stay together
just say let 's do n't let go
and i 'll keep holdin ' on forever
have the teardrops that you 've cried
drowned the fire in your eyes
is there one flame beneath the smoke
tell me is there any hope
that 's all i need to know
is there one flame beneath the smoke
tell me is there any hope
that 's all i need to know
"she sparkles , she dazzeles"
she lights up the room
we walk together
to a table for two
every man stares
but her eyes are only for me
we take to the dance floor
she squezzes my hand
i ca n't believe
just how lucky i am
meanwhile
back in the back of my memory
you 're still dancing with me
and i 'm holding you once again
meanwhile
we move to the end of a beautiful night
tender the kisses
soft candle light
she draws the curtains
and slowly we climb up the stairs
and reach for each other
the passion begins
we fall together
as lovers and then
meanwhile
back in the back of my memory
you 're still lying with me
and i 'm holding you once again
i try and i try
lord knows i do
but each time my heart
beats back to you
meanwhile
i 'll go on living my life now
i 'll find a way somehow
oh but
meanwhile
back in the back of my memory
you 'll always be with me
but i 'll never hold you again
meanwhile
i heard you 've been wondering
how i 'm getting along
i guess you think i ca n't make it with
but i do n't want you to worry
do n't you lose any sleep
but a man called long-distance this morning
said they 're thinking about putting me
on the cover of the usa today
the story of heart-breaking pain
picture of the loneliest man they claim in the usa
i do n't sleep in the nighttime
darkness reminds me of you
i lost eight pounds since last tuesday
but i could stand to lose a few
i do n't believe i 'm too bad
people say i look fine
the man from the paper seems happy
says i 'm bigger than the latest crime
on the cover of the usa today
the story of heart-breaking pain
picture of the loneliest man they claim in the usa
so if you 're concerned in trouble
then you 're hurting me
do n't you work out this little thing called losing
has made a big man out of me
i 'm on the cover of the usa today
the story of heart-breaking pain
picture of the loneliest man they claim in the usa
leon dixon leaves his christmas lights up all year ‘

"well i never thought that i , could make it"
thought i would die but i seem to carry on
and i thought my life would surely leave
"and though almost , i have not ceased to be"
and even though i thought i lost everything
"today i found , that the birds still sing in"
and the world keeps spinnin ' 'round
and the world keeps spinnin ' 'round
"when someone says goodbye , another dream ends"
and just before you give up another dream begins
"someone changed their mind , tears fall to the ground"
but you know that one man 's smile is another
"and the table will turn someday , that 's how"
'cause you know that time do n't stand still
all the world keeps spinnin ' 'round
yes the world keeps spinnin ' 'round
dawn will find me here and i think about
one that i thought i could n't live without
"one day she was here , the next day gone"
but the love that was never clear was just alone
"and how can you lose something you only thought ,"
so you wipe away the tears with a smile
all the world keeps spinnin ' 'round
yes the world keeps spinnin ' 'round
all the world keeps spinnin ' 'round
all the world keeps spinnin ' 'round
i wonder were you cold that night
lying there by mary 's side
taking your first breath
i wonder were you scared to death
"fully human , fully god"
full of wonder and the blood
that one day you would shed to save the world
tiny feet and tiny hands
with all the earth at their command
it must have felt strange to you
sweet baby jesus
come down to love us
to lie in a manger
so far from home
you could have left us
helpless and so lost
but you chose to save us
sweet baby jesus
the first time mary held you close
all wrapped up in tattered clothes
did you see tears fall from her eyes
just a mother holding her first child
"fully human , fully god"
full of wonder and the blood
that one day you would shed to save the world
tiny feet and tiny hands
with all the earth at their command
"oh , it must have been strange to you"
sweet baby jesus
come down to love us
to lie in a manger
so far from home
"oh , you could have left us"
helpless and so lost
but you chose to save us
sweet baby jesus
sweet baby jesus
come down to love us
to lie in a manger
to die on a cross
"oh , you could have left us"
"helpless and so , so lost"
but you chose to save us
sweet baby jesus
sweet baby jesus
away in a manger no crib for a bed
the little lord jesus lay down his sweet head
the stars in the bright sky look down where he
the little lord jesus asleep on the hay
the cattle are lowing the baby awakes
the little lord jesus no crying he makes
i love the lord jesus look down from the sky
and stay by my cradle 'till morning is night
away in a manger no crib for a bed
the little lord jesus lay down his sweet head
the stars in the bright sky look down where he
the little lord jesus asleep on the hay
the little lord jesus asleep

"it soubds so dogone heavenly , you can hear the"
"and when you stomp your feet , your heart will"
a rhythm to the old steel guitsr rag
"you may be kind choosy , 'bout the kind of"
"you maybe like them blusey , makes you cry right"
but if you want a song that 's bound to
make happy your soul with that old steel guitar rag
in our bedroom there 's a portrait done in different

in the scatch we 're arm in arm but in
and it soon become and tear my world apart
and before my days are over i 'm gon na

where love and patience never die
no small miracle
by kenny chesney
in a little town down south
there 's little plowboard house
with a wolf outside the door
and in the bedroom there 's a light
its been staying on all night
for at least a month or more
the heartaches and the bills keep coming due
and with all they 're going through
its no small miracle that love hangs on
hearts get weary when hope is gone
in a world where roses wither and die
its no small miracle when love survives
its been uphill for a while
but he still makes her smile
every now and then
lately they been finding out
it 's the little things that count
and they do what they can
he tells her he loves her everyday
she says things will be ok
in a world where roses wither and die
it 's no small miracle when love survives
when the sun came up this morning i took the
and as its beauty struck the darkness from the sky
i thought how small and unimportant all my troubles seem
and how lucky another day belongs to me
and as the sleepy world around me woke up to
all its silent beauties seemed to say
so what my friend if all your dreams you have
just look around you you got a whole new day
today is mine today is mine to do with what
today is mine my own special cup to fill
to die a little that i might learn to live
today is mine
like most men i cursed the present to avoid the
and raise my thoughts beyond tomorrow and vision there more
but as i view this day around me i can
for today 's the only garden we can tend
today is mine ...
i was feelin ' the blues
i was watching the news
when this fella came on the tv
he said i 'm tellin ' you
that science has proven
that heartaches are healed by the sea
that got me goin '
without even knowin '
i packed right up and drove down
now i 'm on a roll
and i swear to my soul
tonight i 'm gon na paint this town
so bring me two pina coladas
one for each hand
let 's set sail with captain morgan
and never leave dry land
troubles i forgot 'em
i buried 'em in the sand
so bring me two pina coladas
she said good-bye to her good timin ' man
oh now i 've got ta say
that the wind and the waves
and the moon winkin ' down at me
eases my mind
by leavin ' behind
the heartaches that love often brings
now i 've got a smile
that goes on for miles
with no inclination to roam
i 've got ta say
that i think i 've got ta stay
'cause this is feelin ' more and more like home
so bring me two pina coladas
one for each hand
let 's set sail with captain morgan
and never leave dry land
hey troubles i forgot 'em
i buried 'em in the sand
so bring me two pina coladas
she said good-bye to her good timin ' man

watching her i can not help but go back in
and suddenly i find i am 15 again
slow dancing with the moon
"oh , the stars got in my eyes long time"
and i 've lived my life like a love sick
in a bittersweet cartoon
just a dreamy-eyed kid slow dancing with the moon
watching the girl i 'm reminded she 's quite a
"trapped in the suburbs of wonderland , lost in her"
"somehow my heart never grew up , no one ever"
so here i am swirling in star dust slow dancing
still believe someday my wildest dreams will all come true
and i 'll find someone who 'll make me 15
but until then i 'm slow dancing with the moon
"oh , the stars got in my eyes long time"
and i 've lived my life like a love sick
in a bittersweet cartoon
just a dreamy-eyed kid slow dancing with the moon

it 's been so long
i should be used to this by now
loneliness that keeps coming back around
the moon on my window casts a different light
on all these memories that keep me up tonight
"hey , i know just what i need"
that 's you and in a hurry
if i got on the road right now
i 'd see you at four thirty
"hey , i think i have about"
sixty miles of gasoline left in my car
there 's an all night truck stop
"yeah , i bet i could get that far"
i can close my eyes and smell coffee in the
"i 'll fill my cup , if you 'll wait"
i 'll soon be there
"hey , i 'm letting go"
so baby do n't you worry
wheels on ground
i wo n't slow down
i 'll see you at four thirty
"hey , i .. yeah"
"hey , i wo n't allow my mind"
to talk me out of this
past every exit sign
cause that 's the way it is
"hey , i 'm letting go"
so baby do n't you worry
wheels on ground
i wo n't slow down
"i 'll see you , yeah"
"hey , i know just what i need"
that 's you and in a hurry
"oh , wheels on ground , i wo n't slow"
"i always say the first thing , not the right"
i 'm better at a last call than a phone
i 'd rather lean hard on the gas and forget
i try to laugh the truth off instead of face
i come undone without a warning
"every time i move on , i leave damage in"
i 'm not what you were looking for
thought i was hello and nothing more
"all you wanted was something that 's real , a"
"a drink , maybe two , top of the shelf"
a stare in a cab on the way to some
and a curbside closing time kiss

saying folks thanks for flying with us
but there ’ s a 6 in 10 chance
we ’ re going down

about this emotion
even knowing our chances are small
we line up at the gate with our tickets
thinking somehow we ’ re different
i mean after all we ’ re in

your convenient friend
oh but i know what you ’ re doing
and what you hope to find

yes i 've done at least one thing that was
and with you i have one dream that will live
and each day i will know as i watch our

love and learn about the birds and bees
and the flowers of the mystery
and if you really want to give yourself a blue
and learn about the blues
the rocky road is pretty hard to take
but you do n't know nothing till your heart breaks
if you want to know how much you 've got
and learn about the blues
love is a game where your life gets spoken
but the game gets rough when your heart get broken
you 'll say at home a sittin ' all alone
or the telephone
then you 'll know about what everyone must learn
if you play around with love your will sure to
so when you go to pick a guy be careful
or you 'll love and learn about the blues
[ sax ]
love is a game where life gets spoken ...

when i see this bar
pieces of our past slowly slip away
but time just stands still when i walk in this
and i see a kid coming into his own
and a man learning to move on
somehow trying to find his way
a dreamer betting on blind faith
chasing that sun and following his heart
"yeah , that 's what i see"
when i see this bar
pieces of our past slowly slip away
but time just stands still when i walk in this
a few have moved on back to maine
jacksonville and key biscayne

stuck in still life it seems
no matter where they 've been
or where they are

always makes her sad
the thunder and the lightning reminds her of her dad
today she makes a jailbreak
today she leaves the nest
she 's packing up for college
and she picked one out west
she 's had enough gray
the clouds need to part
her life 's been that way
she needs to recharge
her family 's been broken
just like her heart
she 's always been scared of the dark
she feels like a solar power girl
she needs to live on the bright side of the
her mama worked two jobs
raised her all alone
how come superheroes always come from broken homes ?
her daddy liked to drink
her daddy liked to swear
best thing he ever did was vanish right into thin
that supergirl needs sunlight so she gets in her car
she 's going somewhere she can feel the earth 's
she 'll lay down on a blanket 'neath the hollywood
and wipe all of this outta her mind
'cause she is a solar power girl
she needs to live on the bright side of the
yes she 's been through the storm
her new life 's begun
like a rose 'bout to bloom in the sun
'cause she is a solar power girl
in the dark of the night
she realized
tomorrow the sun 's gon na rise
and she is a solar power girl
she needs to live on the bright side of the
yes she is a solar power girl

well the two new people that 's moved to the
and we 're at the top of the town and
well we found love and happiness people envy us you
for we found heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
yes we found what most people are looking for
and it 's not a lotta money to spend on
but it 's so when and where a bird flies
and there 's whole lotta winds in this little house
four thousandth block proves what true love can do
once a lonely place but was sold to me and
oh all around the house you can see little children
but they 're not as a people 's kids were
they are the symbol of our love for all the
they 're a part of heaven right here on earth
our love 's on the day you can see many
for look at the house they think there from the
they think this place would make them as happy as
and the whole town 's tryin ' to buy our
four thousandth block proves what true love can do ...
and we 're not gon na sale our happy little
would n't take a pretty thing for the love we
look into my teardrops and darling you will see
the reflection of an angel that made a fool of
look into my teardrops and you will see the eyes
that promised me so many things but all of them
look into my teardrops the mirror of my soul
and you will see the girl who stilled my only
look into my teardrops and you will see the one
that broke my heart forever are n't you proud of
[ ac.guitar ]
look into my teardrops ...

well i ca n't tell you where i 'm going
i 'm not sure of where i 've been
but i know i must keep travelin '
till my road comes to an end
"i 'm out here on my journey ,"
trying to make the most of it
"i 'm a puzzle , i must figure out"
where all my pieces fit
like a poor wayfaring stranger
that they speak about in song
i 'm just a weary pilgrim
trying to find what feels like home
"where that is no one can tell me ,"
am i doomed to ever roam
"i 'm just travelin ' , travelin ' , travelin"
i 'm just travelin ' on
"questions i have many , answers but a few"
"but we 're here to learn , the spirit burns"
to know the greater truth
we 've all been crucified
and they nailed jesus to the tree
"and when i 'm born again ,"
you 're gon na see a change in me
god made me for a reason
and nothing is in vain
redemption comes in many shapes
with many kinds of pain
"oh sweet jesus if you 're listening ,"
keep me ever close to you
"as i 'm stumblin ' , tumblin ' , wonderin"
as i 'm travelin ' thru
"i 'm just travelin ' , travelin ' , travelin"
i 'm just travelin ' thru
"i 'm just travelin ' , travelin ' , travelin"
i 'm just travelin ' thru
"oh sometimes the road is rugged ,"
and it 's hard to travel on
"but holdin ' to each other ,"
we do n't have to walk alone
"when everything is broken ,"
we can mend it if we try
"we can make a world of difference ,"
if we want to we can fly
"goodbye little children ,"
goodnight you handsome men
farewell to all you ladies
and to all who knew me when
and i hope i 'll see you down the road
you meant more than i knew
"as i was travelin ' , travelin ' , travelin"
"i 'm just travelin ' , travelin ' , travelin"
i 'm just travelin '
drifting like a floating boat
and roaming like the wind
"oh give me some direction lord ,"
let me lean on you
"as i 'm travelin ' , travelin ' , travelin"
thru
"i 'm just travelin ' , travelin ' , travelin"
i 'm just travelin ' thru
"i 'm just travelin ' , travelin ' , travelin"
i 'm just travelin ' thru
like the poor wayfaring stranger
that they speak about in song
i 'm just a weary pilgrim
trying to find my own way home
"oh sweet jesus if you 're out there ,"
keep me ever close to you
"as i 'm travelin ' , travelin ' , travelin"
as i 'm travelin ' thru
i remember the day that clayton delaney died
they said for the last two weeks that he suffered
it made a big impression on me although i was
they said he got religion at the end and i
clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
i thought he was a hero and i used to
i often wondered why clayton who seemed so good to
never took his old guitar and made it down in
well daddy said he drank a lot but i could
i knew he used to picked up in ohio with
clayton used to tell me son you better put that
there ai n't no money in it it 'll lead
i guess if i 'd admit it clayton taught me
i can see him half stoned pickin ' up the
when clayton died i made him a promise i was
i 'd give a hundred dollars if he could only
i remember the year that clayton delaney died
nobody ever knew it but i went out in the
i know there 's a lotta big preachers that know
but it could be the good lord likes a little
i remember the year that clayton delaney died

the end has come and found us here
with our toys scattered all around us here
the puzzle that we never found an answer for
"still asks us , darlin ' , just what all"
and here we stand in a box of sand
where 's the playground susie ?
you 're the one who 's supposed to know her
where 's the playground susie
if i do n't stay around ?
if i do n't stay around ?
the carousel has stopped us here
it twirled a time or two and then it dropped
and still you 're not content with something about me
but what merry-go-round can you ride without me
to take your hand ?
how would you stand ?
where 's the playground susie
if i decide to let you go and play around
where 's the playground susie
if i do n't stay around ?
if i do n't stay around ?
where 's the playground susie ?
you 're the one who 's supposed to know her
where 's the playground susie
if i decide to let you go and play around
"look under his floorboards , mama"
i do n't trust his silly grin
he 's got a beat up rambler with nebraska plates
i ai n't getting in
i do n't like the way his pinky ring
picks up the dashboard light
or his short little piggy fingers
or the way his belt is cinched too tight
"check under his floorboards , mama"
i do n't like his suggestive tone
the way the words drip from his mouth
"as he asks , can i take you home"
i do n't care how many miles i got
i think i 'd rather walk alone
than to sit in the back seat
as his eyes in the mirror
reduce me to flesh and bone
"check under his floorboards , mama"
'cause that razor 's not just a threat to me
he 'll be slicing tiny crescents from your heart
without laying a sweaty palm on your cheek
do n't accuse me of running scared
but listen to what i 'm saying
it 's a fucked up old world but this ole
"well , she ai n't giving in"
falling out of love with me
writer dolly parton

the hardest thing i 've ever done or that i
was to just walk off and leave you but i

and i could n't stay to watch you falling out
the loneliest i 've ever been or that i 'll
is now that i 'm without you and i feel

"i 'm coming home , i 've done my time"
and i 've got to know what is and is
if you 've received my letter tellin ' you i

if you still want me .

"it 's been three long years , do you still"
if i do n't see a ribbon round the ole
"i 'll stay on the bus , forget about us"
if i do n't see a yellow ribbon round the
"bus driver please , wo n't you look for me"
oh 'cause i could n't bear to see what i

and my love he holds the key
a simple yellow ribbon 's what i need to set
and i wrote and i told him please .
honey tie a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree

"see that train coming round the bend ,"
carrying the one that i love
"her beautiful body is still here on earth ,"
but her soul has been called up above
"body and soul , body and soul ,"
"that 's how she loved me , with body and"
"her beautiful hair was the purest of gold ,"
"her eyes were as blue as the sea ,"
her lips were the color of summer 's red rose
and she promised she would always love me
tomorrow as the sun sinks low
the shadows will cover her face
"as her last sun goes down , she 's laid"
and my teardrops are falling like rain
left a good job in the city
workin ' for the man every night and day
and i never lost one minute of sleepin
worryin ' bout the way things
might have been
big wheel keep on turnin '
proud mary keep on burnin '
rollin ' rollin ' rollin ' on the river
cleaned a lot of plates in memphis
pumped a lot of pain down in new orleans
but i never saw the good side of the city
big wheel keep on turnin ' ...
"rollin ` , … .."
[ guitar ]
if you come down to the river
bet you gon na find some people who live
you do n't have to worry
` cause you have no money
people on the river are happy to give
big wheel keep on turnin ' ...
rollin ' rollin ' rollin ' on the river
i just took your picture off the table
and i just took your picture off the wall
hide from you anywhere i 'm able
but there 's one place i ca n't hide from
"tennessee , you do n't make the whiskey"
"california , you do n't make the wine"
"and mexico , you do n't make tequila"
strong enough to get her off my mind
memories seem to know just where to find me
and lately they 're all that i recall
and everything in this old house reminds me
of the love i had and how i lost it
days go by and i still feel the sorrow
and time do n't make a difference in the pain
just sitting here and waiting on tomorrow
will drive me crazy if i do n't go insane
strong enough to get her off my mind
strong enough to get her off my mind

onward to the prize before us
soon his beauty we ’ ll behold
soon the pearly gates will open
we shall tread the streets of gold

"jenny grew up wild , like a blackfoot daisy"
out in the shack with a blue tick hound
"broke as hell , but blessed with beauty"
the kind that a rich man ca n't turn down
she caught the eye of an oil man dancing
one summer night in a dime store dress
"she had the looks , he had the mansion"
and you can figure out the rest
"it was all roses , dripping in diamonds"
sipping on champagne
"she was all uptown , wearing that white gown"
taking his last name
"she could hear those church bells ringing , ringing"
"and up in the loft , that whole choir singing"
fold your hands and close your eyes
"yeah , it 's all gon na be alright"
"and just listen to the church bells ringing , ringing"
"yeah , they 're ringing"
jenny was hosting junior league parties
and having dinner at the country club
everyone thought they were ken and barbie
but ken was always getting way too drunk
"saturday night , after a few too many"
he came home ready to fight
and all his money could never save jenny
from the devil living in his eyes
"it was all bruises , covered in makeup"
dark sunglasses
"and that next morning , sitting in the back pew"
praying with the baptist
"she could hear those church bells ringing , ringing"
"and up in the loft , that whole choir singing"
fold your hands and close your eyes
"yeah , it 's all gon na be alright"
"you just listen to the church bells ringing , ringing"
"yeah , they 're ringing"
jenny slipped something in his tennessee whiskey
no law man was ever gon na find
and how he died is still a mystery
but he hit a woman for the very last time
"she could hear those church bells ringing , ringing"
"standing there in a black dress singing , singing"
fold your hands and close your eyes
"yeah , it 's all gon na be alright"
"and just listen to the church bells ringing , ringing"
"yeah , they 're ringing"

tears were falling like the morning dew
but when i closed my eyes my loneliness was gone
cause i dreamed my baby came home
and you were holding me kissing me like you used
my heart went crazy when you whispered i love you
yes you were standing there sweet as you could be
like you had never said goodbye to me
for just a little while my loneliness was gone
cause i dreamed my baby came home
i went to sleep last night lonely and blue ...
and you were holding me ...
yes you were standing there ...

keeps my heart and her hair a mess
"she goes where the wind suggests she goes , who"
got a spirit that ca n't be tamed
she 's a calico pony on an open plain
i know i 'll never be the same no more
she 's a wild child
got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy
she ca n't be tied down but for a while
i 'll be falling free and so alive
might break my heart but god she drives me wild
you 've never heard of her favorite band unless you
been to bonnaroo or burning man
"she 's penny lane in a chevy van , she"
she loves me wild child
got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy
she ca n't be tied down but for a while
i 'll be falling free and so alive
might break my heart but god she drives me wild
she 'll be here until she runs
some just have to chase the sun
she 's a wild child
got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy
she ca n't be tied down but for a while
i 'll be falling free and so alive
might break my heart but god she drives me wild
a kaleidoscope of colors in her mind child
a touch of crazy hides behind her wild smile
so simple yet experimental
innocent but still a little wild child
wild child

little boy running through the yard
fell and skinned his heart
and later climbed up in a tree
"as he looked into the sky ,"
he began to cry
"and said , `` daddy why 'd you leave ?"
"call me daddy , i 'm feelin ' blue"
"call me daddy , i need to talk to you"
"call me daddy , help me through"
and then he bowed his head to pray
`` call me dad ''
the little boy became a man
found a bride and took her hand
and made a baby all their own
"as he looked in that baby 's eyes ,"
as the baby cried
"he swore , `` you 'll never be alone ''"
call me daddy when you 're feelin ' blue
call me daddy and i 'll talk to you
call me daddy and i 'll help you through
and then he bowed his head to pray
`` call me dad ''
another life has come and gone
another baby 's grown
and stands alone against the world
"as he looks into the sky ,"
he begins to cry
"and says , `` daddy i miss you ''"
"call me daddy , i 'm feelin ' blue"
"call me daddy , i need to talk to you"
"call me daddy , help me through"
and then he bowed his head to pray
`` call me dad ''

do you recall when we parted
the story to me you revealed
"you said you could live without love , dear"
in your loveless mansion on the hill
"i 've waited all through the years , love"
to give you a heart true and real
because i know that you 're living in sorrow
in your loveless mansion on the hill
the light shines bright from your window
and the trees stand so silent and still
"i know you 're alone with your pride , dear"
in your loveless mansion on the hill
in your loveless mansion on the hill

just another bar
with loud guitars
smoke and candles burning low
and the same ol ' boys
their backs to the bar
staring across a crowded floor
then i hear a familiar sound
your voice laughing out loud
from a distance i can see you
dancing slowly with somebody new
but i ca n't hold you like i want to
but i can love you from a distance
so i take a chair
in a corner somewhere
you ca n't see me
but i can look at you
and i remember those times
when i looked in your eyes
the way that he now looks at you
deep down i know it 's over
but it hurts me when he 's so much closer
from a distance i can see you
dancing slowly with somebody new
but i ca n't hold you like i want to
but i can love you from a distance
and if i ca n't hold you near me
i 'll just hold onto your memory
from a distance i can see you
dancing slowly with somebody new
but i ca n't hold you like i want to
but i can love you from a distance
i 'll always love you from a distance
intro :
like the morning sun
his love moved across every inch of my body
and the heat from the fire burned me up with
i thought i 'd died and gone to heaven for
this morning when i opened my eyes
there to my surprise
lay that angel i thought had been only a dream
and so i said a little prayer
"and thanked god , that he was there"
"oh , this is a dream come true"
dream do come true
i know 'cause i found you
i never thought they did
but now i do
dreams do come true
it was love at first sight
and it was love all night
and the way he made love to me
fulfilled all my fantasies
"ooo , this is a dream come true"
"yes , dreams do come true"
i know 'cause i found you
i never thought they did
but you 're living proof
that dreams do come true
tag :
dreams do come true
and i am so in love with you

i never counted on you
makin ' me blue
they say your a runnin ' 'round
with somebody new
who can i count on
if i ca n't count on you
i thought i held a precious key to heaven
your love was sweet and gentle at the start
but now i feel that i ca n't go on

there goes my happiness
and here comes the blues
i ca n't convince myself that
we 're really thru
who can i count on
if i ca n't count on you
the door to happiness was almost open
just one more step or two and i 'd be
then all at once the vows you made were broken
the door to happiness was closed again
who can i count on
if i ca n't count on you
there goes my happiness
and here comes the blues
i ca n't convince myself
that we 're really thru
who can i count on
if i ca n't count on you

her momma 's still got that sequin gown that she
she taught her early how to smile that smile and
it took a whole lot of years and tears
for her momma to finally admit
no matter how many stitches and pins
that old dress was never gon na fit
she was daddy 's little girl
momma 's little angel
"teacher 's pet , pageant queen"
she said `` all my life i 've been pleasin
living someone else 's dream ''
"her daddy used to say , `` you 'll make"
he 'll ride up on big white horse and just
it took twenty-five years and some broken vows
before they 'd finally see
there 's a little more to love and life
then fairy tales and hand me down dreams
she was daddy 's little girl
momma 's little angel
"teacher 's pet , pageant queen"
she said `` all my life i 've been pleasin
living someone else 's dream ''
now she 's got twenty-seven candles on her cake
and she means to make her life her own

that you threw away
did you give it up ?
did i let you down ?
"either way , it does n't matter"

i hope you find where you belong
hello - goodbye
life goes on
"in another town , in a little place"
looking in the eyes of a pretty face
i ai n't no fool
i know what she 's thinkin '
i can hold her in my arms
"but , i could never let her stay"
"cause , love"
your sweet love
still gets in the way
minute by minute
i hear the voice in my heart
"be a man , take her hand"
and make a new start
"so , i think a little less"
i drink a little more
"cause , all in all she 's everything"
that i 've been waiting for
she smiles that smile
i face the fact
love 's a give and take thing
and i ca n't give it back
i want to be free from the noise of the

on the highway to nowhere that runs through my mind
a yellow line stretches out into the night
broken in places it 's my guiding light
so i 'm writing that freedom a line at a
i 'm walking a fine line between wrong and right
i can live with the problems of this day and
consider me lucky cause i 'll be all right
in my mind i 'm having a beautiful life
i 'm lost in the feelings of this heart of
in search of the border of infinite time
and i find peace of mind in the songs and
so i 'm writing my freedom a line at a
as i look in the mirror this morning
on some dirty old restroom wall
it took a while to realize it 's really me
'cause i 've aged twenty years in five .
i recall when i looked much younger
and it was n't so long ago
but one night of drinking to four nights of wine
and you 'll age twenty years in five .
i 've aged twenty years in five
i 've seen the dark side of life
from a mansion on a hill
to straight whiskey from a still
and you 'll age twenty years in five .
before the bottle i played my music
on the road with a five piece band
and with the pressures of the game
i drank up fortune and fame
and i aged twenty year in five .
"oh , but i 'll change this way i 've"
or i 'll be gone before my time
i 'll climb back to the top
and with my friends i wo n't stop
till i erase twenty years in five .
"yes , i 'll erase twenty years in five ..."
we did n't know that times were lean
round our house the grass was green
it did n't seem like things were all that bad
i bet we walked a thousand miles
chopin ' cotton and pushin ' plows
and learnin ' how to give it all we had
as life went on and years went by
i saw the light in daddy 's eyes
and felt - the love in mama 's hands
they kept us warm and kept us fed
taught us how to look ahead
"now lookin ' back , i understand ."
we were walkin ' in high cotton
old times there are not forgotten
those fertile fields are never far away
we were walkin ' in high cotton
old times there are not forgotten
leavin ' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
when sunday mornings rolled around
we dressed up in hand-me downs
"just in time , together with the church"
sometimes i think how long it 's been
and how it impressed me then
it was the only day my daddy would n't work
we were walkin ' in high cotton .
there 's one more sip in this bottle of wine
a lonely star hangin ' in the sky with a
and it 's yours if you want it
and this wildflower from the neighbor 's yard
a real slow dance in the moonlight dark
this hand in my pocket
"oh baby , just call it"
cause it 's yours if you want it
and every bit of love left in this beat up
that 's been waitin ' on a girl like you
i know it ai n't much
but it comes alive with every touch
every kiss already feels like you own it
baby it 's yours if you want it
half of this rickety front porch swing
every word of every song i sing
my jacket when it 's cold
"oh baby , do n't you know"
you 've got a place to lay your head
on the other side of my empty bed
and it 's just made for fallin '

"every dollar , every dime , every drop of rain"
every yesterday and tomorrow
well every grain of sand on the beach
every blade of grass under our feet
baby your name is written on it
and it 's yours if you want it
and every bit of love left in this beat up

water in the milk from a hole in the roof
where the rain came through
what can they do ?
tears from your baby sister
crying 'cause she does n't have a dress without a
for the party to go
but you know she 'll get by
because she is living in the love of the common

it 's a good thing you do n't have bus
it would fall through the hole in your pocket

walking to town to find a job
trying to keep your hands warm

and it chills to the bone
you better go home where it 's warm

but the closer the knit the tighter the fit
and the chill stay away

and many a prayer

we stood there in the courthouse room
"so close yet far apart ,"
you had brought your lawyer
"and i 'd brought a broken heart ,"
the judge pronounced the words
"the way you wanted him to do ,"
"and changed your name from brown to jones ,"
and mine from brown to blue .
"i could n't keep my tears from falling ,"
"on the courtroom floor ,"
"by law , they took away my rights ,"

i have chased after rainbows
i 've captured one or two
i 've reached for the stars
and i have even held a few
i 've walked that lonesome valley
"topped the mountains , sewed a sky"
i 've laughed and i have cried
but i have always tried
'cause i 've always been a dreamer
and dreams are special things
but dreams are of no value
if they 're not equipped with wings
so secure yourself for climbing
make ready for the sky
do n't let your chance go by
you 'll make it if you try
so try to be the first one up the mountain
the highest flying dreamer in the sky
and try your best to be an inspiration
brothers that are still afraid and shy
and try to make the most of every moment
'cause if you never try you never win
so try each day to try a little harder
"and if you fail , get up and try again"
you know nothing is impossible
if you can just believe
do n't live your life in shackles
when faith can be the key
the winner 's one who keeps determination in his eyes
who 's not afraid to fly and not afraid to
so try to be the first one up the mountain
and try to be the first to touch the sky
"and do n't let somebody tell you , you ca"
"and if they say that , show em it 's"
and if you fail at first just keep on trying
'cause you are not a failure in god 's eyes
so spread your wings and let the magic happen
'cause you 'll never really know if you do n't
and the first step is the one that 's always
but you 'll never really know if you do n't
you have to try

i remember the windows rolled down and the wind in
driving 'round in your daddy 's old chevy
like we were going somewhere
we thought that summer would last us forever
going steady was just something you do
i did n't know much about love
i learned that from you
now those were some good times
lately they do n't seem to last
i guess i 'm not nearly as strong as a
and the nights just get later
i can stay up and wait or just go on

and i learned how to kiss on a ferris wheel
and i made wishes at wishing wells
and i fell into that fairytale too

it 's alright

one night while the whole world was turning
i left you a note
and i told you that i 'd always miss you
then i let you go

i didn ' t know you could fall out of

and i know that love ai n't so easy

it 's alright
some dreams were n't meant to come true
i learned that from you
i remember the windows rolled down
see the girl at the table sipping on wine
would you believe that once she was mine
oh lord how she loved me and never complained
while doing without for my foolish dream
she found some rainbows i could n't see
while she learn to do without so many things
she 's slowly learning to do without me
she 's learning the ways talk of wild side of
some stranger would hold her for the first time tonight
while she learn to do without so many things
now she 's slowly learning to do without me

she did without diamonds on her wedding band

and hear a fast train rattle and roll
i wan na live out my days like a hobo
and take myself that long-needed rest
"hey , hey i 'm longing to ride on a"
and be a good old american guest
yes i wan na live on the land that
i 've loved and i 've labored for
and spend a few days headed west
i 'm longing to ride on a freight train
and be a good old american guest
"oh , yes i 'm longing to ride on a"
and be a good old american guest

"the first scene was the church , then the altar"
"where we claimed each other , with tears of joy"
our friends wished us luck there forever
"as we walked from the church , side by side"
the next scene was a crowded courtroom
and like strangers we sat side by side
then i heard the judge make his decision
and no longer were we man and wife
i hate the sight of that courtroom
where man-made laws push god 's laws aside
then the clerk wrote our story in the record
"a church , a courtroom and then goodbye"
we walked from that courtroom together
we shook hands and once again we cried
then it was the end of our story
"a church , a courtroom and then goodbye"

looking through these old photographs
do n't they bring some good memories back
some of them make us laugh
and some make us cry
i 'm glad we 've kept all of these souvenirs
to prove that our love was here
look at how happy we were
pictures do n't lie
if forever should end today
and there 's no tomorrow for us
what a day yesterday was
here 's one of us with you calm and cool
but look at me acting a fool
and here 's one of us on the ferris wheel
at the fair
"hey , have n't we had some fun"
the best may be yet to come
we may have a hundred years
still left to share
but ...
let 's close this book of photographs
and let 's turn out the lights
and love for the moment
as if it were the last
if i had one wish
i would wish for two
for me and you
to be happy
with the way things are
sometimes it gets hard
but we 've come so far
to be happy
yeah i dont think that im complaining
sometimes it keeps on raining
oh but dont be frightened by thunder and lightning
the sun comes out and the flowers grow
and you find you 're already on the road
to be happy
if i had one prayer
to pull out of thin air
"everyone , everywhere ,"
would be happy
we 'd hand out valentines
"i 'd be yours , you 'd be mine"
"there 's a place , there 's a time"
to be happy
"oh , i dont think that im complaining"
sometimes it keeps on raining
oh but dont be frightened by thunder and lightning
the sun comes out and the flowers grow
and you find you 're already on the road
to be happy
yeah we fuss and we fight
we ca n't see the light
we wake up and decide
we dont need to be right
to be happy
i dont think that im complaining
sometimes it keeps on raining
oh but dont be frightened by thunder and lightning
the sun comes out and the flowers grow
and you find you 're already on the road
to be happy
yeah to be happy

he keeps watch all through each long and lonely night
he still finds the time to hear a child 's
saint or sinner call and always find him there
though it makes him sad to see the way we
( he can grab a wish or make a dream
he can paint the clouds and turn the gray to
he alone knows where to find a rainbow 's end
he alone can see what lies beyond the bend
he can touch a tree and turn the leaves to

it takes every ounce of strength we ’ ve got

worrying ‘ bout the daily grind

it ’ s one day at a time
one foot in front of the other

is just another mile together
unconcerned about the twists and turns
we ’ re takin ’ it nice and slow
"safe and sound , covering ground"
steady as she goes
yesterday is dead and gone
and tomorrow takes care of itself
we ’ ll just keep on keepin ’ on
‘ cause we ain ’ t stumbled yet

take one step and then take another

and birds like tender babies in your hands
the old man playing checkers by the trees
mac arturh park is melting ...

there will be another song for me for and i
there will be another dream for me someone will bring
i will taste the wine while it is warm and
but after all the loves of my life after all
i will take my life into my hands and i
i will win the worship in their eyes and i
and my passions flow like rivers from the sky
but after all the loves of my life after all
i 'll still be along wondering why

i am dreamin ' tonight of a place i love
even more than i usually do
and although i know it 's a long road back

the old man who sold his apples is n't there
and the city square do n't seem as big as
they tore down that old drugstore we used to love
but everything it 's still the same in my memories
that old school bus has long stopped runnin ' and
and the movie house is all boarded up where we
and the sign that said state champions is covered up
but everything it 's still the same in my memories
in my memories of us things are still the same
for yesterdays are something tomorrows can not change
where freckles just do n't disappear and pigtails never rust
and everything it 's still the same in my memories
my memory of us
oh i believe the time is coming when the lord
i believe the end is closer every day
let 's be ready for the judgement when we look
for he tells us in his word to watch and
we are living surely living in the days he speaks
i believe the end is near in every door
so let 's be ready for his coming let us
and believe today in matthew 24
while upon the mount of olives his disciples came to
saying tell us when these things are going to be
jesus answered be ye watching let each one be free
and take heed no man shall ever you deceive
we are living surely living ...
we are living surely living ...

kaleidoscope my eyes shapes and hues
i learned to bend the light easily
i know there 's more beyond what i see

why do the things we love disappear
