# How To Run Notebooks

This repository contains code and data to create lyric generation models.

## Process Data
To process the raw song lyrics and artist data, please run the notebook `process_data.ipynb`. Further instructions about how to process the data are in the notebook.

## N-Gram with Laplace Smoothing Model
To create an N-Gram lyric generation model, please run the notebook `ngram.ipynb`. Further instructions about how to run the model are in the notebook.

## RNN with LSTM Model
To create an RNN with LSTM lyric generation model, please run the notebook `rnn.ipynb`. Further instructions about how to run the model are in the notebook.

## GPT-2 Poet Model
To fine-tune a GPT-2 Poet model for lyric generation, please run the notebook `gpt_2.ipynb`. Further instructions about how to run the model are in the notebook.

## Model Evaluation
To evaluate all models, please run the notebook `evaluate.ipynb`. Further instructions about how to run evaluation are in the notebook.

Enjoy :relaxed:.
