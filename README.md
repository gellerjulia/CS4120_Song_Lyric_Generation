# How To Run Notebooks

This repository contains code and data to create lyric generation models.

## N-Gram with Laplace Smoothin Model
To create an N-Gram lyric generation model, please run the notebook `ngram.ipynb`. Further instructions about how to run th emodel are in the notebook.

## RNN with LSTM Model
To create an RNN with LSTM lyric generation model, please run the notebook `rnn.ipynb`. Further instructions about how to run th emodel are in the notebook.

## GPT-2 Poet Model
To fine-tune a GPT-2 Poet model for lyric generation, please run the notebook `gpt_2.ipynb`. Further instructions about how to run th emodel are in the notebook.

Enjoy :relaxed:.
